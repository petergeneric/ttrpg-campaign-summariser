hello internet friends and welcome
to well last week was the final episode
so
what's the opposite of penultimate post
ultimate welcome to the post ultimate
you know we we have more endings than
return of the king that is our
goal thank you so much for joining us
this is going to
uh a a a lighter
sillier well no i don't know if it's
gonna be sillier we're pretty silly
than what we usually do this is a chance
for you guys in the chat to ask
questions both of the players of me
things you want to know about the module
things they missed things that
uh i know i'm already anticipating
talonsorn's australia questions
i know he was he was deep in that and
it's also a chance for
the players to ask some questions uh
before we get started just a few quick
announcements
obviously we're not rolling any dice
tonight but that doesn't mean that birds
of paradise are not at hand
the official dice of the great dane
society
i have got a whole set right here wait
or you know
um birds of paradise you can go to their
website
and get use our code probably chaotic
you'd think i'd remember it by now
uh use our code to get a nice little
discount off of there
uh it's getting close the shipping you
know the shipping window is closing so
get
get those orders in if you want those
dice stocking stuffers in there
uh and andrea congratulations on
all the success this year with the
kickstarter oh it's
all good stuff very exciting so birds of
paradise
we love them they will remain the
official dice of the great dane society
who knows maybe
by the time we start up again in in the
new year we might have
we might all be using new sets of birds
of paradise who knows
very exciting nord games nord games
uh does great
wonderful things for sadly mostly d and
d
uh although we've we've shown how you
can use them
in what is it carbon 2185 i
remember the name of the game
uh we've shown how you can use them in
that any
sort of game that uses a similar
mechanic i mean
really you could use them in just about
any of the iterations of of d
or many different games their luck
deck their crit deck
uh all of their monster stuff it's a
great way
to play dungeons and dragons without
giving wizards of the coast any of your
money
which really is a good thing so support
nord games we've got a code with
them i think that gets you a nice little
chunk off too
um and uh
who was our other sponsor i blanked on
our third
well there you go we have
as always we have a
uh we have of a
semi full week of televise of
televised entertainment for you this
week so so
i don't know how many of you know but
sadly um
james has uh
has sprained his voice in his
in his day job he was filming a short
film
uh about the avatar the last
airbender thing
and apparently got a little exuberant
and did some damage to his voice that
tea will not
that tea has not healed yet so there
was not a rhyme of the frost maiden this
week
monday the game is a it's
it's minute to minute we're gonna we're
gonna have look for james
updates on on social media as
you know we wait until the last minute
to see
is he going to show up and are all of
his characters going to sound like
so here's what i'm thinking with this is
what we're going to do
last week literally we're like please
shut up he's like oh i don't know if i
can make it or not blah blah blah i was
like
stop talking i was like here's the thing
if your voice hurts
just say no and then shut it don't don't
continue to yeah
and as he was doing it you know there
were probably like three different
voices
as he was doing it he's got puppets
oh yeah here we go so if james
against doctor's orders let's be clear
the man is a hero
if he can somehow fling off that blanket
and make it to that chair
he will be here by god uh
so stay tuned on pins and needles to see
if on monday
like like a thing that is resilient
james has risen and is back to lead
that game on its way tuesday
probably it's the theme for this week
the chaos
agents are playing uh
nobody's sick they're just all kind of
you know they've all had one too many
i say you man for all the chaos that
we're going through to view
it's true it's true so tuesday
probably the chaos agents and then
saturday
rhyme of the frost maiden probably
depending on james and then you know
there are a few guarantees in this life
but if you tell me to show up somewhere
by gosh i am showing up there
so next saturday at our normal time
we'll have in a shortened show we're
gonna do it live
uh
on the great dane society so next
saturday at the normal time we will be
doing character creation
for season two so you'll get to see how
people
build their characters you'll get to see
um how
we sort of connect stories and that sort
of thing uh
you'll hear more about season two in
a little while
so saturday could be a double header
but we will definitely be there because
frankly i don't have a life
so seriously tom
back when he was still uh
he he wanted to run his one shot for
this group but he kept saying
but ezra's never not there
yeah unless i go to europe you know i i
have uh
you know if i 90 of success is showing
up
and so i always show up that is a weird
thing about me
uh so thank you
uh again for last week for the
insanity
of all the support that you gave us last
week we had
a great crowd it was fun to see names
that we hadn't seen in a while that
showed up
for the the last one i was unable i
still have eight bits i have to spend
today so i will be rerolling
everything i roll today uh
i tried to spend them but i just i just
couldn't uh
and we we really appreciate the
love and the support
uh it is awesome to spend part of our
geek end with you
that that is always a special
thing for me and
uh it's gonna be weird to have a few
saturdays off
i'm not sure although we have one less
than i thought so you know
it's becoming less and less weird as we
go
it's literally two saturdays wow
well all right you really took the bloom
off that rose sorry a little excited i'm
like wow i'm gonna get a vacation
yeah this is gonna be awesome um
i wonder so chat is currently
excoriating me for not killing enough of
you and i'm just hoping that somebody in
their five years thing dies
that's really that's my only hope
that's possible
so let's let's start there last week at
the end of things
i asked each of the players um
oh that's a great question i'm writing
that one down
the answer is yes yeah i just would say
we already we can also every single one
of us
i'm not looking at the questions you
know probably yeah
answer is exactly right exactly i was
about to say the same thing
okay come on you guys i'm not looking at
all right so last time
at the end of last session i asked each
player to spend a little time thinking
little did i know see here's why i don't
play these games anymore
because i would literally ten minutes
before the game be like i wonder what
happened five years ago
meanwhile i had characters like writing
me asking me questions about like
what do you think about this and if you
know how would this ever and i'm like i
don't care
it's over come on um
so a you're all better people than i
am
and b wow you put way too much
thought into all of this
uh so that's great because that's why
this world works
because it takes my shoddy slap dash
world building and then you breathe life
into it and something magic happens
so five years from
now we magically
touch base with each
of the with many of the members of the
great danes society
um and
who wants to start us off with their
coda
go for it should i just go since i think
mine oh no i mean
julie julie was all right go ahead
tell us about professor lamb in 1931
what have those five years been like
well you know i was hanging out with
holly and thinking about going
you know over to the delta green but i
didn't do that first
it just seemed like it was gonna be
boring and i was hyped up
on all this this was awesome i could i
you know i stopped time i i made
somebody sick
and i reversed i i kept my head
i kept my head when it was getting all
uh you know everything was going down
terrible pun yeah well but so i
julie will not be joining us in season
two
we we'd like to we'd like to send our
regrets
just wait just wait just wait so but
then but then
emma emma reached out to her and said
you know what
we could we could take what you've done
and we can we could go on a crusade and
i'm like yeah let's go
so i i took emma and i went on something
i'm sure emma can give us some more
and they were really fun and then
i said oh should i fill in some of the
blanks together i was gonna say then
yeah can you can you go can you go all
right so emma goes back to the vatican
now because mission accomplished
and i'm gonna air quote that as i air
quoted
much of my explanation to many of the
cardinals as to what actually happened
there was a lot of yada yada yadas and
well you know
there's a lot of that in the explanation
but what really they kind of got hung up
on
was the fact that joan had basically
reverse time and so
that had given the vatican an idea where
instead of just trying to like
subversively dominate
the world to overtly dominate the
world
by you know so basically i as the agent
of the church
went to see joan and made her an offer
that she
didn't refuse you know
italian and italian bourbons saying that
you know if you come work with us
um to def you know to create the
technology the technology
um to go back in time we can go back and
the offer to joan was the fact that like
if you go back in time you can get the
artifacts before they become artifacts
was the pitch so that was the pitch in
the short and so at some point you know
joan came back and we did have a couple
escapades and so
we went back in time and obviously my
mission was to
you know besides help joan get artifacts
um to
maintain the dominance of the church
through the ages was essentially like
what
what emma's under how long martin luther
yeah exactly martian who
[Laughter]
so i'm sorry so that's where we met and
we did a couple escapades jones so if
you want to pick it up from there
wait did you guys kill martin luther
because
i now want to run a game where you're
so so if you do do you want to talk
about because i was going to talk about
at what some point
we had some escapades but one of them
went a little
only one yeah that's pretty good all
right you know
and then the knife slipped and you know
well
we had we you know there was a whole
bunch of them i wasn't sure which one uh
you wanted to to highlight but uh
which everyone had the best item which
was the best artifact
was it the knife that slit jesus's
side was it the oh god i was like
what's the box with the ten commandments
in it the ark of the covenant
like that one oh that would i i was like
yes please
the best part is emma's in the vatican
going what's that box
the box with the 10 commandments
amanda jones went and stole and
and i had that that nice staff with bone
on it
and well at one point when we were in
mary magdalene got in the way
see this is where i would have been like
you know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened and she
accidentally got stabbed i'm not saying
it was my fault
i'm not saying i was there mary
magdalene got in the way a major tenet
of catholicism
exactly but then then then she wasn't in
and at that point i was like oh this is
not working very well for me and i think
there were some explosions
um was this pre or post immaculate
conception
host immaculate conception wrong wrong
mary though
we're talking about yeah post explosives
as well
yes so i i was like okay um
yeah this is getting to be too intense
for me i thought it was going to be fun
too intense and so i
used my powers to go back to holly and
say hey this uh
these guys at at delta green they
sound pretty cool let's let's work with
them
yeah you know what would be less intense
the united states government
less intense than emma back in time yeah
so
kind of fill that in yes hollister
ended up setting up his own branch of
delta green
somewhat isolated on grey dragon island
to keep it
uh to keep it under wraps for as long as
possible
and he he runs things in the very
boring military way
like it's it's welcome to the
bureaucracy
yeah there's to to to get a mythos
tone you have to fill out paperwork
yes yes and so
for for you british fans he started the
laundry
not familiar the laundry is a a
series of it's a it's actually a game
but it was novels first and the idea
is that
it is english
mundane bureaucracy but brought to the
supernatural so there's like a bureau
of the supernatural where everyone shows
up wearing their gray suits and all
and you know just the income the
incompetence that bureaucracy can
bring to things
looking at his wife's workplace um
and you know just the you know
filling out
forms and triplicate and that sort of
thing i i now know the time delay
because i just heard rachel laugh at
that
so so i i was more than happy to uh
to to to not do the the vatican style
i'd come over and and work with holly
again i was i and
and i i didn't have to beg too hard
for him to take me back because he
said that his door was always open um
but i did have to i did have to
ingratiate myself
with the rest of the team and be that
proper person
so i could get my hands on more
more data so i did i became that proper
person i i put on my
professor persona and so
professor and that way i could be that
i'm trying to decide if this is
schizophrenia or like
i mean maybe someone will column a and
some are calling yes yes schizophrenia
yes i could be
i could be joan or i could be
and so how does joan deal with
mind-numbing bureaucracy
well i mean there is the occasional
field work
and it was spelled out that the
bureaucracy was put on hold
when stuff actually matters
so yeah i think part of so
uh part of the thing that i talked
with the characters of the players about
is that
um in my mind some of the repercussions
of this is that the cold war
started it now in 1926 and it's based
around the mythos
and the first two actors are the us and
japan
who are you know have start start having
this conflict
uh about controlling
mythos objects and that sort of thing
and so you know
your your base on gray dragon island
uh you know could be in some danger
it might i
we could have a we could have a scene
where flint and some japanese
uh mythos ninjas invade grey dragon
island and are
fought off by the uh
the the forces of of captain
rogers commander rogers
uh so that that idea of the mythos cold
war which
um frankly is one that i want to like
use as a world
uh playing a little bit later i think
is
there's a lot of possibilities there um
so so joan
five years finds you pretty much working
in delta green
in hollister's unit yep
all right amy you started us with
emma's stuff so
so besides sword fight besides drunk
sword fighting with pontius pilate and
accidentally stabbing mary magdalene
and now she's a saint and so women have
equal rights in the church now
i mean oops i mean the pope should have
known if you'd have sent me back in time
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that would happen just because
i mean how aware is the vatican of your
your meddling in the time stream
oh they're very aware and then they keep
sending me back to go fix it and it just
gets infinitely worse
but worse worse with quotes around it
because
and again too these are all parallel
universes like i keep explaining to them
you know it's not like there's just one
box to destroy people
this is the danger in telling someone
um yeah so the multiverse
was a big part of
our story and here's the first
spoiler for
the kids at home none of that
multiverse stuff is in the module
uh there's nothing about multiple
anythings
uh there's nothing about constants none
of that
um that was all necessitated by the cast
change that we went through
uh like a year ago
uh where we we lost some of our players
and
uh we essentially had to do a reboot uh
and you know i came up with that
silly id well actually the funny part is
amy rolled the fumble before we knew any
of that was gonna happen
yeah so the crowbar to the box happens
and i not knowing any of what was soon
to happen
was like i'm gonna wait till next week
to tell you
what what this means and i was thinking
of some you know silly things and that
sort of thing
uh little did i know that it would be
four months
that week would be four months and
it would
lead to a a mostly new cast
and having to justify all of that and so
that uh
you know that was that's the first
little that wasn't supposed to happen
easter egg and there are
there are many of them that box
so the that box actually had
parts something that you guys never
really dealt with uh
wanted to deal with um
was that this was the man all of
the
weapon that they were making was being
manufactured
in england and shipped to china
and so that warehouse was full of pieces
for that for the weapon
uh and so if you hadn't blown it up
uh there you know you could find the
address of the warehouse in china and
all this stuff that you could and
there were there were also links
there to take you to australia
but you know i think it it worked
out pretty well i liked the i liked
the
the i actually was very happy with how
the reboot went and i was surprised
uh i talked with a few of the players
and i wasn't sure about re-running
new york i thought about you know let's
just zip through this and kind of
do it narrative and people like no no
let's play it and actually i was really
happy with how it turned out playing
through it the second time i thought it
it added a neat thing to it um
i don't i don't know if i was happy
because i felt like the second time
around we had to get a win
and i still felt like new york wasn't a
win
you know we didn't save a convicted man
or a falsely convicted man
right yeah that was that was a rough
scene that was that was definitely
you know all
uh talent and others who are like
well you're you're you let the players
off easy
you know i i far prefer the players
know this i've said this many times
like death is death is absolution like
killing somebody
no make them live with the awful things
they've done
you know and that's why we took that
scene and and the black pharaoh wanted
to make sure that they
experienced that poor man frying on the
electric chair
to to give them a sense of
the repercussions of their stupidity
and and that to me is so much more
interesting than
just you know like oh good i killed a
player
um but you'd rather we suffer
some yeah no i'm all about i'm all about
the suffering
um we'll see season two could be a
little different because for reasons
uh so i yeah i mean
i think that's a that's a running theme
of this game is that you guys needed a
win
and you you had the astounding ability
to to
to snatch defeat from the jaws of
victory over and over
uh why is that not a title
[Laughter]
uh so so emma becomes a time traveling
uh asian
i'm traveling religious schism it sounds
yeah pretty much
i'm yeah well and i and just to let
everybody know the backstory i i forgot
what game we used to play with ezra that
i used to kid about him and i would make
a series called time pope
like i was bound and determined like two
years ago to make a cartoon
called time hope there's a board game
i don't remember the name of it but it's
essentially liar's dice with player
powers
and you are all cardinals trying to
become pope
and one of you is like the tempest
there's like these differences
yeah the temporal and i always call him
time pope and then amy and i started
riffing on like
the bad 80s you know sitcom that would
be time pope and
you know the pope in in sort of a father
guido sarducci way would be like
and what are the hanuman globetrotters
are doing an ancient rome mamma mia
you know it was every episode was
going to be
time pope and like ridiculous guest star
you know
dick van patten what are you doing here
in the in the playoffs the scene era my
goodness you know
and time pope was just gonna uh
oh my god ending outstanding
what what that is outstanding amy
it's it's you're a gig it's my math time
it's your math time j
matthews85 thank you finally for once
thank you
for giving us the players 2 000 bits
because apparently it doesn't matter now
so and that's why he's my fav my second
of course the baroness my my always my
first
uh two weeks in a row now rachel hasn't
given you bits so she's now my third
favorite twitch user
so what did t what did alexandria
do
after yeah after we basically stabbed
psy's character so we stabbed lady
jezebel
that was such a thing that was such a
thing anyway um
so yeah alexandria to her the win felt
too easy
you know at the end of it it was all
like you know we did all this build up
all this build up and everything and
then it was just
oh it's over and the bomb is gone
and some weird alien things that i don't
i can't even pretend to begin to
understand
took it and who knows how that's going
to affect things in the future
so she has this address on the back of a
letter
and at first she wasn't quite willing to
go follow it
because she was angry and hurt and
all of the things but she had a very
long conversation with hollister that
nick and i actually wrote out the
conversation that they had
and maybe at some point i'll write it up
and put it in the discord
but you know i'll i'll condense it to
basically him convincing her
to go and follow
uh donal she had come to him initially
and said
i i need something to do
i'm gonna go kill cultists point me in
the right direction and i can be more
effective
and he basically was like we're not
sending
someone as mentally broken as you out
into the middle of things
that is not delta green's way so they
came to a compromise
she goes back to she she goes to ireland
for
for a year starts building a life and if
she comes back in the year he'll have
work for her
so she went to ireland after she had a
conv
after she asked hollister to pull a
couple of strings and help her find a
good violin
[Laughter]
and when i when i said that in the
conversation with nick the pun wasn't
intended this time it is
but kimono will not be joining us
yes there it is so if you're interested
in playing call of cthulhu
but she did get a very good violin not a
stradivarius obviously but she was able
to get a good violin
uh through hollister and take the long
way into ireland
stopping off in in italy along the way
to replace her
stilettos because well
they got left behind mysteriously in
africa
and she has a very particular thing that
she likes so
she went off to ireland uh
there was a series of conversations
with donald some of them involving more
broken furniture
in various ways than she would like
to admit
some of them involved in at least one of
she was angry she was very angry um
but she did eventually come to a
compromise with him uh
where she was basically like i will
stay and be here with you um
but once a year i need to go and sharpen
my claws
basically i'm going to go and work with
deltagrain for about a month
every year and if you're not okay with
that i'm gonna i'll i can disappear
it's fine it's fine he agreed
and so once a year for a month she shows
up at gray dragon island
hollister hands her a folder and she and
she disappears again
and problems just disappear
strangely right at about year two she uh
when she shows up she has a thin gold
band on
on her left ring finger she doesn't talk
about it no one asks
about year four she she when she comes
to delta green she's only got about
she only spends about two weeks going
out and killing things in year five she
doesn't show up again
she just sends a letter and says i think
i found what i needed
and just stays there in the cottage in
ireland
she lets she lets emma know where she
is and that's about it
and just quietly disappears alexandria
hartford
dies
that's a shame because i think
alexandria hartford probably can't
cleaned up a couple of agent emma's
messes
some problems historical oopses you know
it's it's interesting you say that
because
if you go back to donald's leaving
emma was actually the problem
and so you know i think it would be a
really
interesting you know my guess is
that if she does do some work from emma
she's do it for demo she's doing it
quietly
oh yeah because you know like
that was you know that was i think one
of the most interesting parts of that
letter which
you know again to pull back the blinds
um
tom found out when he had that cr that
uh a conflict and he would have to stop
immediately and then he wrote that
letter
uh so that was all his voice and his
way of
of writing out that character which i
thought was brilliant and
he he wanted to
you know he wanted to hit some of the
previous notes
from things that people had said
bringing back
uh the quote that that that prophecy
from old bundari and things like that it
was just a
a great story note that i i really
appreciated
a good writing off a writing off a
character
is is hard and you know especially
when you're trying to do it without
outstanding i think that's that's great
uh yeah but but
before the chat there are two people in
this universe that alexandria trusts
absolutely and it's donal for
fairly obvious reasons and it's emma
because because emma was in the other
universe with her she only tangentially
trusts
anyone else but emma gets it in a way
that
no one else in this universe can so
i mean she she trusts emma and emma's
emma
if you'll remember emma was the only one
that she expressed concern
about how um
about how donald was acting as he was
well and was also was it the same when
joan was starting to like really become
obsessive with
occult items yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah i think it's funny that you
know delta green's like we don't want to
put someone who's broken you out of the
field now profess
for lamb doesn't feel like professor
lamb could be the next villain
of the next chapter of delta green like
if you think about
how like cartoons sort of play out
villains and the fact that it's like
oh i'm a great soldier but on the inside
you're scheming for the things you want
like at some point you could literally
lose your mind
and be the actual villain to delta green
like you could be the b you know what i
mean you could be the cobra commander
[Music]
i mean it's as simple as you know joan
remembers that she can
you know use people as batteries and she
starts you
using people as batteries and you know
that's a that's a sli
that's that is not the action of of
someone who is who has the best
intentions for humanity
yeah and and and while and while
alexandria was certainly willing to work
with that she didn't trust
and that was never anything between
players obviously but no no no but but
jones she only tried to to take it from
people you know a little bit at a time
or people who were bad
you know yeah and alexandria was like
yeah you're you're a scatter shot gun i
can't stand anywhere near you
and i'm like oh says the assassin i am
very
precise i choose who i stick with i
don't know i know but but yeah it's like
yeah
that was jones you know jones like uh
kind of inner monologue
exactly you know someone who kills
people for a living is giving me moral
you know so hollister we've talked
a little bit
about what you're doing you started this
new branch of delta green
yeah some people were saying branch what
do you mean
it's that's the wrong word for it but it
is the base you are a
delta green has established a base that
you have control over
yeah in grey dragon island
do does the united states have an
ongoing
diplomatic relationship with amigo
just
not officially it's one of those things
where especially after
uh hollister would would keep up
uh would keep in contact with um
he he wouldn't go against rogers but he
would probably do things like
hey we're going to do a one-time
exchange we'll we'll see you next year
for the next one time exchange
yeah christmas the the
the migo having the super weapon is not
something rogers is fond of
i mean rogers still has the plans so
it's true and the us
here's the the other main thing that
that hollister paid attention to
is that there are multiple warheads on
the island the migo took
one of them so hollister was fine
telling everyone like oh they took the
weapon everyone clear out we're going to
do the ritual everything's fine and then
he gets like the people who
like people from delta green that he
trusts and he's like you guys need to
search this place you need to be very
careful there are two
i think there's two more warheads on the
island right i think so yeah
yeah so america i think
world war ii starts over grey dragon
island
it wouldn't surprise mine the japanese
we wouldn't keep them there we'd clear
everything off
well but the power source is there right
you know that's the problem the power
source that that produces the stuff is
there so
great dragon island is immensely
important still because
once a bloated woman gets to get sealed
away she's i mean she's still there
somebody asked what happened to the
bloated woman
uh so you would have see i mean i don't
i don't think
members of this team would have sealed
her but delta green would have
would have done it they have all the
information for it
so i'll be honest when i um
when i run each week i have
like three bullet points you can't
really see this but i have like
three bullet points of scenes i want to
have happen and um
one of the bullet points i knew for the
last episode
i knew i wanted to do the derelict
destroyer scene
and i knew that the duchess was going to
be on there but
my original plan was that the duchess
would be the bloated woman
and that would be because in my you know
in my
transactional dnd brain i was like all
right three hours to land this plane
that's like scene fight scene finale
you know and so the fight was gonna be
the duchess
becoming like as you got close to
the island
you know lady jezebel would say
something like um
you know oh well first you're going to
need to deal with my friend and the
duchess would like explode into this
horrible awful thing and all this stuff
um but then you guys were
already going and and uh
you know just in the flow of things i
changed it to be the deep ones attacking
the boat
and so you know sometimes you
you come up with these ideas and then
during the flow of the game you just
sort of
go the other direction yeah i was
wondering about that because that's what
i thought when we found her i thought oh
crap okay
we got to take this thing and put it in
that you know but right and then
but i did like so it was good to switch
it up so
i wasn't i wasn't like i know what's
going to happen so interestingly
um actually the the so in the module as
written the ritual of um
with the capstone ritual is only done
though there there are not um
there are not rich there are there are
other rituals and things that can happen
in the other areas
but you know one of
one of the ways the game can end is just
but some people
use the capstone ritual in egypt as sort
of the climax of things
there are there's sort of three three
different ways this module
well four if you count the world ending
but three different ways this module
ends there's usually either a climax
in in in at grey dragon island
um but usually that happens when the
ritual is going on
in january you know you you guys
forestalled that um
there is a finale at the mountain of the
the black wind
with the the bloody tongue or there's
the finale with the black pharaoh and um
i i talked a little bit about this in
the discord but
you know after the the black pharaoh
offers a great opportunity to have sort
of a villain that the players can
interact with
uh the bloody tongue and the bloated
woman less so because they're
they're they're aspects of nylothotep
that are just best deal
and so you know that's why i then had to
play up the human
uh sort of you know uh
the human lackeys pinhue and uh
uh all the all those guys
um and and and really i think
to it's it's better if you're dealing
with
the extra planar kind of craziness um
because
they you can you can bring a sort of
like
oh your flea is to me and have it be
believable whereas you know like
if if if a human sorcerer is saying
that he's still human
even if you know even if that happens um
and so that kind of you know that that
that's
that's a challenge in the module as
written and
you know we can talk about how things
went all sorts of pear-shaped in egypt
in terms of
the story is written and and things that
happened there
um as jay matthews is pointing out
in in this edition the new edition of
the book carl stanford is a cameo
and it's it's it's actually an easter
egg for old call of cthulhu fans because
he is the big bad guy in another
uh another big campaign old one um
and not at all in this one he's
just kind of
a quick a quick shot there but
um because you know because
you don't have that kind of um
what's the word for an evil face
character i don't know
there you go that would be the perfect
one yeah because you don't have that
foil
um that i think that for me personally
is so important in storytelling i mean
there's
yeah there's something to be said for
just the beast that's out of control and
that sort of thing
but it's not reasonable and it's not
it's not it's not as much fun to spar
with
yeah that's yeah and it's it's one note
it's one note oh great question did time
pope emma get a shakespeare phone of
course she did
good that's awesome that's how emma
learned who shakespeare was
yeah pretty much i wanted to
oh i wanted to thank the baroness for a
thousand gold pieces for
she said for two years of wonderful
storytelling and characters to laugh and
cry over thank you
the baroness is one of the few people to
have sat
in this metaphorical chair she uh
there was gosh last christmas was it
last christmas i think it was
or was it too christmas it was it was
christmas i know that
because i was coming from the nutcracker
and we were in traffic
and so the baroness ran
the start of of an adventure and it
was outstanding i
i i i was so happy she's that was
her second cameo
long time fans can she was part of my
favorite bit
i love the old police squad and the the
freeze frame bit where everybody freezes
and something goes on behind you
and the baroness did a cameo there that
was that was an episode that we taped
so i wanted to respond to something uh
with dealing time with sanity and the
numbers because it was mentioned that
alexander was mentally broke and then
they were like wait you got so much
sanity
um i that's like one of the things i
like the least
about like the sanity stuff and called
cthulhu cause like
everything about silvano in particular
like the
the roles that he made were arbitrary
like remember the scene where i smashed
the chair against the guy and just went
in
he he lost it there was no sandy roll
needed he was acting he was complete
in flight mode but like talking with
alexandria at the end
no she was she she was just
continuously looking for the next fight
she was stuck in a cycle
she was and and it was it was after the
big battle
and just not being able to to deal with
that so no she was
yeah she and and character actually had
yeah well and and and to to speak to
that
numbers aside she's been through hell
in the last you know six months and yeah
she's a little bit
more grounded now because she has
this relationship to fall back on she's
actually happy for the first time in a
long time
and then she lost that and had to go
and hunt that down if she wanted it
so she was she was very much in a place
of yeah the numbers were great and
nothing
nothing would make her break and run
immediately but she wasn't in a good
place
she wasn't a healthy person she wasn't
she didn't start a healthy person you
aren't an assassin if you are a healthy
person
just the fact that she wouldn't break
and run when there were points where
it's like
that's the same thing to do right that
was
that was a part of the the cycle and
then the baroness has a question for
you as well why you're talking if you
want to
sure i i see it but the question is
what was the thought process for
alexandria keeping her vocal damage from
one world to the next
so ezra asked me
uh on stream and gizland and i
actually talked briefly about this um
that whether or not because it's a new
world she's in a new body
did the incident with francois
happen and does she still have that that
vocal damage and i thought about it for
a bit
because still in the studio i think he
is
and i did i i did seriously i did
seriously consider whether or not
to have that be healed because
i mean being a semi-famous opera singer
would open a lot of doors
and being able to go and like perform
and things like that that would make
some things a lot easier
but i genuinely think that alexandria
losing her
voice in peru was a huge turning point
for the character
it was the first time that she and keep
in mind this was
what in 1920 she would have been 22 or
there about she was
young when that happened so she was on
the the zenith of her ability to you
know
she she was a rising opera star hi
thomas
emma's really let herself go
[Laughter]
hanging out with my worm
i hate that thing by the way
francois a production of you know
slythertov makes us all these wonderful
props
francois is a creation of my lovely wife
we love you
i hate friend swab but i have a personal
visceral reaction and that's the only
reason
uh so you know to go
i just want to quickly go back to
something nick said about sanity because
yeah
the sanity rules in in call of cthulhu
um
you know you have to find ways to make
it not just hit points part two
yeah and you know the the the actual
number of your sanity to me is less
important
than where you are kind of
in the arc of things i'm
i'm not sure i'm going to do it but
there's there's a a
a guy wrote an article for a a
for a cthulhu site talking about
um his in his game he keeps track of all
the characters sanity
so they don't know what their sanity is
and he just says like
you really didn't like that you know and
and that to me
is kind of interesting but it
it it takes away some player agency uh
which i'm not a big fan of but
partly because i changed the sanity
rules somewhat to make them a little
less
retrograde because some of the some
of the
concepts they use in the sanity rules um
are a little dated and you know some of
the
um a little ham handed i guess i'll
say
uh you know i i think that we're in a
day and age where you want to treat
mental health issues with a little more
uh
understanding understanding and respect
i mean respect is
i i guess is the word you know but just
uh compassion
maybe and so whereas when we were
all playing you know when we're playing
we were playing our home game and
somebody randomly drew kleptomania it
was hilarious
you know that in in modern
times is a little less and that's also
you know one of the things that i think
would be interesting to talk about
is running a game on stream versus
running a home game and sort of the
the the
calibrations one has to make or let me
let me replace that one
should make when when when doing that
uh which is something that i was not
pr
i hadn't really thought about and and
was
uh had to sort of learn yeah
as you know i think we all i want to
jump in really quickly
and just amend what i said with like i i
hate the sanity system
but that's because i'm keeping track
inside my head it's not a
like you know granted there's definitely
things to criticize about it but i'm not
saying like
the san diego system shouldn't be used
for everyone it's just for me in
particular
it's like no i can drive myself crazy
like when i roll the dice i already know
in my head like
how the character's breaking and when
they're gonna snap
and then there's times where like even
though the scene with hollister
trying to convince uh
what is that alexa chris like
in all seriousness he would have
it's almost probably good that i rolled
so poorly
because his actual reaction probably
would have been stronger and more
detrimental
than what ezra kind of pushed him to do
because of the limitations of the sanity
so it's i don't need any help
on that front yeah and that you know
that's an interesting
as a gm you sort of know the players
that you can you can give
the la you know i think in every case
the player it's more interesting when
the players come up with what is
afflicting them
speaking only in the abstract you know
you still run into
especially in cons you still run into
the player
that you know mainly dmd players
who are like my character's superman and
nothing will bother them
and everything's fine and and you know
that that
so here's an easter egg for you my
little everything's fine
saying comes from a con game a cthulhu
game
1990 something at a con in in
uh on the peninsula where i was
running this game
and this guy kept going like whenever
i'd say like all right you know
uh make me a sand roll he just go no
everything's fine
no problem and i started like mockingly
saying it back at him
uh because i was like he just clearly
didn't
understand the idea of the game
and was unwilling
to to make the bargain that you have to
make to play cthulhu which is
you know we're all unraveling and it's
just you know
a call of cthulhu characters like a new
car as soon as you take it off the lot
it depreciates in value
you know and it's never going to be
worth as much as it was when you rolled
it up
um and that's you know that's just sort
of
how the game works and some people many
people
i hope enjoy that journey
and you know nick in particular
uh has a sense through
many many many many different games of
when his character is like
i don't know if there's anywhere to go
here so what nick did with flint
and and with silvano
well yeah he's done several times
before with characters where he's like
you know
i just don't i don't have anything else
uh or or he
or he makes the poor decision to run off
by himself on an alien planet and save
someone and
you know dies off-screen well he was i
mean that that was because he saw
that character saw emma yeah
he blamed himself for not being able to
save her when she died
and like he he couldn't cope with that
and again it's one of those things where
it's like it doesn't matter what his
sanity is
uh same thing with silvano savannah left
because he actually snapped he had
he had sanity left but like he was just
not
mm-hmm yeah there was a lot of stuff
behind the scenes yeah
and the two like my sanity i think i
started in the 50s somewhere
and i'm down to 42 which is not that far
like i don't know if this scale you know
i mean between zero and 100 that's not
bad
but like batshit crazy was definitely
like
my ammo you know i mean at some point
where i'm bicycling around with a bunch
of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] grenades you're kidding me
right like that's a crazy person that's
a person who's like everything's fine
with explosives like
seriously no sanity was back to normal
yeah there's no way your character is
like the numbers that your character
shouldn't be the number that you end up
at if that makes sense that should have
been the five years later we read
emma in the obituary like
she died as she lived bicycling with
explosives
she died doing what she loved and and
and to bring it back around a little bit
uh for the reason the reason why i stuck
with
alexandria losing her voice was because
that was the beginning of that journey
for her
that was where she started losing that
control because she'd had such tight
control
most of her life and wasn't
psychological or was it
actual because again i didn't not i
didn't forget
everything even if i was physically a
different body emma wouldn't know i'm a
different body
like she's not that smart to know that
it was like to me i'm the same person
in every single universe because with
with with with the voice thing in
in particular ezra ezra wanted to know
if that if that same incident had
happened
in peru and my answer was yes because it
was such a big thing and it was this
thing that
previous universe alexandria could key
into with this universe alexandria
in order to not to be morbid but take
over her brain
because she did jumping in just one more
time something that we forgot to mention
hollister came clean to alexandria about
what happened yeah in kenya
that was a part of their talk it was it
was a part of like here's why you need
to calm down and not throw your life
away
yeah and and it was interesting to me
the way that because i hadn't thought i
hadn't realized the way
until nick and i had this conversation i
hadn't realized the way that hollister
saw in particular where he believed that
there was another alexandria
left behind in nida chris's head i
didn't
realize that was how he was thinking of
it i was just like you know
one of the prices for for this was
losing memories
but i hadn't i hadn't thought about it
in the sense of maybe
pre maybe maybe this universe's
alexandria was left behind
in nida chris's head okay
yeah i you know tormented in a cage in
in that head who knows
the way i interpreted it is that you
would be like
with modernize it would be a split
personality where one personality takes
over while the other one
isn't so in that moment
like so you notice at the temple or like
when
after we did the temple like i didn't
let up to alexandria
like i was gonna put my sword away i
wasn't gonna do any of that because
i was like she's knight of chris right
now and so
at some point hollister and i need to
have a conversation as to when we're
going to kill her
yeah and i was honestly waiting for that
because i as the player we're watching
you guys be really suspicious of
alexandria i'm like it's still
hollister wouldn't because it's the
as soon as a move is made against nida
chris
basically how hollister sees it is that
alexandria made the ultimate sacrifice
so a version of her could have the
peaceful life and that's one of the
reasons why
he he was so adamant about talking her
down and
and making amends with donald trump and
and he turned out to be right and she
she'd even at some point like sent him a
letter like don't you dare be smug at me
but you were right
and you know i wanted he is very smug i
want to
uh drop some plaudits at tiana's feet
there because
um you know i i talk a big game
about a player player agency
and you know i mean i i think there are
examples where i was pretty good about
saying hey i want to do this big thing
to your character i want to check it
with you
i did not do that with the knight the
knight acres thing literally
came to me in a blue flash like as we
were playing
uh and as anyone would
you know later on after we did it i was
like i'm a little uncomfortable with
this this isn't my character that sort
of thing
um and and and played it like a pro you
know really
got that dichotomy that was super
important but
um when when i when i came up
with the idea which literally happened
as they were
having that conversation with donald
where you know like donald who
who made several deals and it didn't
carry through on any of them and
and you know the oath breaker stuff
which but
like i had you know i i was sort of
coming up with
this mechanical thing of when nidacres
would take over and that sort of thing
um and and really that was
pretty artificial like it wasn't really
going to happen but i wanted
the uncertainty there of like i'm losing
control you know i'm gonna lose control
oh jeez
when i do this this happened you know
that sort of thing um
and that you know that
so so again props to tiana for going
along
on the fly with my uh
with my kind of blundering idea that
that really totally took
everything away from her but um
[Music]
the the you know the the
if you're gonna do like talk to your
players beforehand that's that's another
thing that is
tough on stream but like you know if i
had there
you know when we talk about things that
i would do differently that's right up
there in terms of
uh sometimes that idea you have in the
middle of something that's live on
camera
maybe sit on that for a minute you know
you can come back to it
but i think this group is mature enough
to know that after the fact we can
discuss it
and the fact that ezra gives us the
ability to retcon stuff
so like i know for that one moment i'm
like okay i'm gonna have to conversation
like
amy is gonna have to talk to tiana about
how do you feel if i
kill your character like because my
character will be forced at this
x moment to kill you yeah you know so we
need to have this discussion as players
um you know so as opposed to being like
you know in game just
whatever happens happens yeah just roll
with it because you know
at 9 30 we can have a discussion to say
okay i was not a fan of this
and what do we do to fix our way out of
here or two days later come back to the
group and say you know what
i'm not crazy about this and
sylvana wants to come home well and and
and for me
the the whole night of chris thing
speaking speaking somewhat frankly
i think this comes back to what ezra
was talking about about
things that should be considered for as
far as streams go
i didn't mind the the the body thing i
thought that was fascinating i thought
that was cool and
me being a non-binary person i i
playing with with the dysphoria of it
of being
in the wrong body was really interesting
to me the only thing that i really kind
of cavaled at was being
a white non-binary person playing a
white woman
in a black woman's body and that sort of
made me go
[Music]
in a home game that might be more okay
but out on a live stream
that that has all sorts of just not
tasty things
let's just lay those eggshells down in
front of you exactly
where it's like especially heading into
africa where the where the racism
subplot was so
dominant yeah yeah but again we did a
good job i mean we played with size
you know the whole shtick of you getting
stuck in the window like there were
other things that you can play on right
necessarily like you know i just want to
be clear again that like
that was 100 me on the flip of a dime
coming up with that idea it was not you
know and
and tiana took took the poor hand that i
gave her and did great things with it
but
you know as when when she and i had a
conversation
you know the first thing was all right
yeah where how are we gonna you know
how are we gonna transition out of this
yeah you know how are we gonna tell the
story
in in in an interesting way that just
takes us to
where you want to be and and
that was you know that's how you should
handle these situations
with players and gm's is if you're a gm
and a player comes to you and says hey
i'm not comfortable with this
you say all right how are we going to
get out of this you know let's come up
with how we're going to do this
and and you you lay it out pretty
you know pretty pretty clearly saying
okay here's where we're gonna get to
and and i i promise we're gonna get
there um
because otherwise you you know
you're you're
you're not listening to the player and
and the player
is like what's going on here i'm i'm
very unco i told you i'm uncomfortable
with this why do i why why do we keep
doing this you know that sort of thing
well and that's something that i really
appreciate about you as a gm ezra
is is that you know you're you're very
quick
to be like okay this didn't work how do
we pivot
yeah yeah i i have yet to see you get
defensive
about about choices that are made and i
uh there's already chaos in the rank
from the chaos agents we don't need to
do that
no you know look
when you're the gm you're telling a
story with
a number of other people and you know
they
they have just as much tell
and pull in the story as you do and um
you know your job is to create
a somewhat stable and
understandable framework that you know
if i do if i do this i can expect x to
happen probably
you know and and deviate now and then
but
if you're going to deviate away from the
norm that's a conversation with the
player
and if it's not a conversation with the
player
and the player says whoa i'm i'm i'm not
okay with that
it's a course correction you know always
a hundred percent that's that that
has to happen the baroness did ask a
question
she asked me what my favorite part of
the scenario was
and and actually dead boy is probably
right
the scene with flint and the baroness
where flint put his finger in the
bearing
[Music]
silvano right where silvano put his uh
finger in the baroness's mouth that was
that was pretty fantastic gross
i really enjoyed the judges put her
finger in his mouth and like
that was that was awesome that was
awesome in defense
so oh the duchess not the bears not just
not the baroness and she's here and she
can hear you
um but the yeah the bareness was
before the show that's that's when
that's where the inspiration came um
but my favorite part of the actual
module as written
uh is probably uh
the shipley scenario with miles and the
mother
and and with
an ambulance just stabbing himself
in the leg with this sewing needle oh
oh man that was oh my god oh my god oh
my god
i could just i could hear i could listen
to a loop
of emma going call an ambulance
i could listen to that on a loop for i
don't know how long
didn't i have legitimately thought about
putting that as a ringtone oh
that oh no i i i love this where it says
here
uh ezra won't be joining us in the
upcoming season
reincorporation always works that's an
important lesson
i'm gonna admit a few things i cheat
i enjoy cheating
and so when you said the favorite part
of your scenario i do have to say that
i loved being the sword of akmala and
thank you slytheytop
how many props did he made the capstone
is that a real crowbar it no this with
this one i i got from
he also made other elder signs didn't he
that was like he made i think he made an
elder song
well i and i have i have a little tiny
rock one
oh nice yes this one's a real rock those
are the sad ones that ezra made
yeah this one's a real rock too it's not
foam it's like painted in there
it'll actually stop other worldly beings
involved i couldn't find the other rock
i must have put it in my office or
something because he had that other one
that was the big one but i couldn't but
my question is
i actually towards the end of the
scenario flipped through the book
and i really struggled to find the sword
of akmala
so what is this where did it come from
like mala is actually a person in the
game
he is that that old gentleman that
you meet
at the at the thing he is called the
sword of Akmala there is
and and there is no sword um
but i just liked the idea of you know
because you sort of it was this burden
that he had to bear that you took on and
as soon as you took it on
they all disappeared and then things
went to hell you know
as they do around us yes they do yes
yeah but no there there was no
magic sword and then when one of the
actually
one of the early points when joan
and silvano like were like we're going
to stonehinge to make this even more
powerful and i was like yeah
there's like nothing in the rules about
like turbo elder science but i was just
like that's fantastic
that has to work and you know that was
just too good and so
similarly with the sword you know and
and sort of
having this idea of places of power and
ley lines and stuff like that we had to
uh we had to keep that going that was uh
that was that was too good to do but uh
yeah the sword of Akmala
is is that guy whose name i don't
remember uh
because i was looking up stats for the
actual sword i was like this sword has
got to have stats yeah
it's got supernatural stuff it doesn't
even
the thing is is that you had the sword
before that so
like that was a perfect chance for ezra
to to do symmetry there
uh by the way don't look at any of the
stats because i don't look at them i
have no idea what's down do you also
have the broken cap stone there too
it's yeah it's somewhere in here oh okay
because there's the
one and then there's the half one yeah
after before we put it back together
you know slightly taught makes a great
point the initial prop that was made for
the great dane society was the headdress
of
eyes the baroness made which hopefully
has shown up at dead boy's house by now
i'm hoping given the us mail
uh but uh
uh the the the headdress of eyes was
the initial one
by the way the headdress of eyes is in
the book
and it is actually an intelligent item
in the book
and so that was like one thing
that i i actually did that was true to
the book we have
we have like many different headdress of
eyes this is the one that when i wore it
this is because i didn't have one here i
made one so
um that's what jones would look like
nice so yeah the headdress of eyes
was actually
fairly on the nose from what's in the
module
uh in terms of did it fight with me
like it like it was like my annoying
sibling
well so the in in the book the
headdress of eyes just takes it tells
you to do things and then if you don't
do it it tries to take you over
and like the longer you wear it the
harder it gets
to be against it but yes it does
mention that it treats you like a child
you know that sort of thing like let's i
think there's
um you're just a natural to play that
[Laughter]
uh i do love the headdress of eyes yes
uh one thing that i didn't so
um there are two books to this and like
the first is peru new york
and london and egypt and then the
second one is australia
uh china great dragon island but the
problem and then like all the
appendices and so to find all the stuff
you have to like go through all of these
appendices
or i guess you know you could use an
index sure yeah i mean how big is the
book isn't it like 600 or some pages in
totality
oh yeah it's 650 pages of of mass of
nyarlathotep
let's see here here we go headdress of
eyes gold headdress hundreds of small
eyes uh
when when first activated anyone not in
the service of nairobotep begins to hear
a voice in their head
the voice appeals to the wearer's dark
side encouraging them to follow a path
of selfishness
self-preservation and adoration of the
black pharaoh and so
um when you first put it on like that
was when it was like let's start fires
you know let's get out of here you have
to save yourself in the hospital and so
you know i started out yeah the ether
thing
um and then i just had to like rag on d
and d with the whole attuning thing
and then it just would have spiraled
from there where you actually made it a
cursed item like something like the ring
of winter or a cursed sword or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
like
that you have become the thing you swore
to destroy
uh yeah yeah well i always did love
intelligent items they're
they're a weakness of mine and and
i'm just giving you crap for fun because
i love it i think
i think it turned out really well it was
good it was fun uh
uh so what about you guys what are your
favorite like scenes or
or parts of the game from all that we
did oh
i like the part not when it happened i
like later
when i as silvano had realized that i
had just
after because after i had shot the
crazy lady who was spewing lava from her
yeah okay like silvano went and just
started picking off
uh cultists off the other boat to
desperately get them off but he was in
such
a mode that he didn't realize that he
was doing it and it wasn't until later
like there was a moment i forget the
scene
but he was just like oh i killed all
i killed a whole bunch of people i
killed all those like
like it didn't even and that was that
was a part of his internal
breaking down because his self-image of
himself was so
uh he was like well i did this one thing
that was horrible but like i
i had to and then it was like and then i
killed a bunch of other people
oh no nom nom nom deep ones
yep yeah yeah eating the deep one that
was pretty
that was pretty awesome and that fed
into
a lot of his breakdown with his personal
self images when he would break he would
just do these violent things
and that they were just super intuitive
and and primal to him and
that was the yeah the the the the
just taking a huge bite out of the deep
one was a pretty outstanding
uh outstanding scene people are
people writing some of their favorites
in the in the chat too oh that's a good
one
the flint and that pilot's head just
always had the pilot
yeah i loved how how how committed flint
was to saving that guy's head
he's like paddling with one arm above
like i got you buddy i got you god
that was pretty awesome yeah to this day
by the way
tom and i i mean tom not donald
tom does not understand why i was so
incredulous about the shooting
of the guy in egypt the the like going
back and shooting the guy who was like
crawling away
oh yeah you just murdered that guy he's
like
well but it was the right thing and i'm
like but yeah but the people would that
would start a raid
a white guy just murdered a a guy in the
streets and
uh i i i still get kvetching about
that
well and that and that was something
that that prompted alexandria talking to
emma about he's
it's getting a bit it's getting a bit
much i mean i'm
torn because like the the military side
of me is actually very different like
that's one of those things where
uh there there have been cases where the
military is like we're gonna make an
example of what happens when someone
comes and and kills one of our own
and then the people in the area are like
oh we're not doing that ever again
so you could also be brought up on
murder charges too yeah i mean yeah
and just code of justice wind blows
today you know yeah and especially in an
environment
like cairo especially at the time
with all of the
with all of the garbage that we had
created right right
a white guy you know killing someone who
was crawling away begging for mercy
is not a good look no no and then the
train like that
to me the scene that i the scene that
surprised me the most was the train
scene
in kenya which one yeah which one
the the the the indiscriminate murder
you know that was like that was to me
that was
i'm kind of glad emma didn't know about
that that was like
that was when and i mean let's be
clear
we're murder hobos players doing
aberrant things
is is par for the course what i think
is
interesting and what i think is
uh you know something that i kind
of wanna
would like to probe at if it starts to
happen is
why why players are starting to take the
easy way out
sure you know there's one of the
things that
i love about call of cthulhu is that
there are very real repercussions if you
decide to take the easy way out you know
if you say well
the bad guys do it so we can do it you
know yeah
our sanity costs there's there's a an
actual legal
system and a structure and and that
kill all the people you want but be
prepared to have a rationale for it for
some reason you know and be prepared
to have your you know
have have be prepared to
you know have it have a human a cost to
your humanity
yeah yeah with with the train scene that
was
as as one of my favorite youtubers likes
to say a cock-up cascade
where alexandria saw someone casting a
spell
and tried to make it stop not realizing
that she couldn't actually do the thing
without
a particular material component i.e
blood
she didn't realize that because she
doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with magic she hates the
stuff
so she tried to make it stop and then it
just kept
getting worse up to the point where it
was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it this is gonna happen
anyway i'm going to go and kill this
woman in front of everyone because i
don't care anymore
but it was it was a cock-up cascade that
started with one
really bad decision alexandria kicked
herself a lot for that part
where she spent a lot of time in emma's
wardrobe on the way
into the city going no i could have just
not responded
yeah that would have been fine but also
sorry i'm just responding to someone oh
no the gorilla so
um they are because i've heard about in
your other games is that just something
you do you just turn people into
gorillas i just love i love
i was so taken with that idea that i
used it in my hometown
um it's actually something i stole from
that's not in marvel actual module no so
that was
oh epic there's a superhero
in marvel comics superhero called
gorilla man
he was like a victorian hunter who
killed
uh a gorilla in this temple of the
and and the idea is that you're immortal
not you know only another person can
kill you and if they kill you
they become a gorilla and so his main
superpower a he's a gorilla so he's
super he's strong and all this stuff
but his main superpower is like he can
fall a really long way
and you know he can he can slowly thread
himself back together and all this stuff
and he's like nope not gonna kill me
and i just i i really liked that idea
uh of that i of that image
um and you know it was suitably pulp we
as we were starting to play more pulp i
sort of liked that idea
uh in our home game chad who
who many of who all the players know
but he is current he's been a gorilla
for a while now
and that actually led to a about a an
on the boat scenario that i loved where
he found a vampire
who would sneak down there was a hold
where all the animals were
and so he's just sitting in their board
and like they keep smuggling him the
newspaper and he's like sitting in this
cage reading the newspaper
and they bring him down food and stuff
but at night
this vampire would come down and eat the
blood
of drink the blood of the animals
and so then they're like do we deal with
this and they just all sort of backed
away
they were all fine with it you know
julie julie you have a scene to share
yeah what's your favorite scene
thanks nick thanks nick i was kind of
nick
no i i think it it wasn't a single scene
but it was the time
when we got to go to the place where um
uh the alternative wasn't quite an
alternative universe but the kind of the
pocket universe where
joan had her own museum oh the emma
universe
i like how you know the emma verse is
now joan world
yes well she had her own museum and
there was all the books that she could
read and
somebody in the chat was saying how come
nobody likes to read books i'm like john
read all the books
as soon as she read the books away from
those because
yeah exactly it's like everybody kept
trying to take those books away from me
what
but that was that was one of my
favorites that whole time
in that area and being able to deal with
all that that was one of my favorites
and of course you know
saving the world and getting my brain
back come on getting being able to
reverse
time and the flight that was epic that
was
that was like yes but no before that you
know before the you know saving the
world thing
i really really liked emma world i
really liked having that
was that as well yeah was the space mead
was that real
because like okay because i really like
emma thought for sure
julius caesar did it this way so this is
the way we have to do it
i totally i i really was trying to
figure out
how to bring a you know a thousand
soldier
sorcerer you know so a sorcerer legion
into play at the end
you know i was like can i get can i get
uh somehow get augustus to show up and
lead the oh wow yeah
with enough time magic you can yeah
that's true
you know take all my stomach bile and
throw it over on everybody it'll be
afraid
[Music]
i did you did some really cool stuff in
the space meet like you
the the bizarre solutions and stuff you
came up with
yeah that was really cool yeah that was
like finally making
space me disappear because no
[Laughter]
uh one one of the challenges there
was and and it was not the first time i
ran into this challenge
was making stuff up and then forgetting
it as i made it up
uh and so i was like the whole thing
with like if you go back and watch the
time
dilation part it's not great
like it is not terribly consistent it's
magic it's not supposed to magic it it's
actually
it's it's it almost should not be
coherent you should go back like there's
holes in this it's like yeah that's
magic
but it made sense it made sense in the
context of where we were and what we
were doing
like i i didn't have any trouble
following it as a player
oh someone was asking uh
could the the ancient knife bringing
back rome was that your attempt to bring
oh yeah no that was
that was a sad attempt of like um
oh god they went to rome that's not in
any of the books
what am i gonna do no no okay so
so esri gives us crap all the time for
how long we took getting through things
and i'm over here like three weeks in
rome says it wasn't entirely our fault
yeah like it was tough because we had to
talk about that and
i remember it was after the blimp and
i'm like it takes too long like we
shouldn't be dragging on this stuff and
it's like but you did have to blow up a
blimp like i can't fault you for that
one like that that had to happen
okay yeah yeah you can i really you know
i wanted
go ahead no i just i love i love that
the terracotta warrior is like my
my hitchcock cameo i always want the
terracotta warrior in there i
i i said in our in our chat that that i
don't really have a favorite anything
but i will say that the groundhog day
sequences i guess with within the game
partially because
we had to keep looking at it was flint
at the time right
yeah yeah where no no where where where
on the blimp
no it was hollister at that point was it
was it hollister okay
i can't i can't remember which of your
characters is where he had been
teleported back after shanghai
and flint okay she looks so similar
because because i mean the nice thing of
course about dawn of alexandria having a
relationship is i didn't have to explain
anything it was
trust me i know what i'm doing and he
would say okay
i trust you talking hollister around was
the harder part and i loved it
well hollister was already because the
stuff you guys were doing he his first
impression of everyone was like
it was basically like this is this this
crack crackpot jeez anyhow well i don't
know but like there's this skilled team
that's handling all this stuff is like
they must be
reading through the things like well
there must be reasons for this and
they've somehow made it through so
there's something i'm not seeing and
then it's just like these people
are she's getting a bicycle and hand
grenades you were looking for reason
where there wasn't any
we were looking for reason and chaos and
so on the blip he's just kind of like
sitting back
like i'm just i'm just taking this in
i'm just like i don't even know what to
say anymore
the i did enjoy the arc of hollister
going from like
i'm going to let these professionals
handle this in a professional manner too
what the hell yeah you probably
know what you're doing probably the only
professional the only professional was
alexandrian she's only professional when
i don't know some people some people i
got a dm from somebody saying okay
what's the deal with joan and hollister
oh i ship them hard though wait no i
thought i thought joan was with what's
his name the uh
who was the other scientist oh god why
can't i remember my character's names
i don't know australia i don't know
aldrin
the aussie guy yeah what was his name
the guy that i killed
yeah the guy you killed yeah five flies
his name clyde yeah henry clive live
i've said it like four times
no one listens to me that was brutal
i so just i did not want to do that
you you you were messaging me actually
at one point where it was like
at some point hollister is going to talk
to alexandria about quietly removing
this person
yeah and then the scene comes up and
he's like well i'm going to go to the
pyramid and i'm like crap i'd like
i know like i have to do something i
can't just let him screw this up
no and that took that took a while for
joan to like like to to forgive
about but we had those intense sessions
and and afterwards two i remember uh
someone in the chat was uh
mentioned like fearing that hollister
was going to kill one of the party
members and like
like that's horrible but that's
delightful like i was prepared great
no i was i was totally ready for for
emma and
uh and hollister to team up and be like
alexandria in night of chris's body
is too much of a liability she needs to
be removed
much in the same way that alexandria was
watching joan
and going when she becomes too much of a
liability she just won't wake up one
morning
where you guys are like nope she's gotta
go no
really because like she she would throw
chaos in the middle of things but it was
chaos that made things happen
and that's why joan joan and emma kind
yeah i i never i never felt like emma
was actually a liability or at least
alexandria ever thought of her that way
yes do you think police wouldn't stay at
the same
hotel as emma i know do you think for a
single second that has ever stopped
alexandria
my character he has killed friends
before
what i mean it's it's an interesting
tack because
there was definitely a
you know there were there were moments
where
uh i heard it from joan and i heard
it from donald where they're like emma
emma emma
and and and there was this whole like
you know and and
you know alexander was like emma what do
you think what should we do you know
that sort of and
there was there was a i really liked
that tension
and and that's actually the reason
why i decided
totally on a flyer to make
jonah constant as well i wondered about
that
what was that at all that's a good
question that's a good question
yeah i i i
it sort of just came it actually i
started to think of it when
um julie and i had a conversation
off camera about some of her
frustrations with how the game was going
and that sort of thing and how
better how i could better
mesh her into the group and that sort of
thing and
um and i started to think about it
then but then it just sort of popped in
at the you know the moment came and i
was like oh yeah let's do a reveal this
will be
um and and you know that
part of it was you know because i
think i
uh gmming is kind of like
teaching in the way that if you don't um
if you don't blind yourself you will
play favorites subconsciously
and and i could watch nick and emma
read the phone book
and i would that would be a fun game for
me you know that just they
they know exactly what i want and they
give it to me
you know and so i was i was when
dogs car chases explosives
so when when joan when joan when julie
first brought that to my attention
i started to think about it that way of
you know
i and and i go back and i'd look and i'd
see that subconsciously
i was kind of like i was pushing
this you know like monkey want monkey
want happy pill
you know give me what i want you know
and that
that wasn't necessarily serving the
story and so i i
tried to correct from that somewhat with
varying degrees of success
um but you know but that was when that
was when i decided that was going to
happen
which hopefully no one is trying
to find any sort of consistency with the
whole constant thing
because like i when i first made it up i
was like i don't even really know what
this means
but sure you know and then then like
about
five sessions after i did that i was
like what if one of them dies
well i i think the idea with the
constant is just i mean
from what i've gathered from what you've
said is that
one exists in every universe they can
still
die because they're still human
but there's still one there's one in
every universe as opposed to someone
like madame madame jezebel
lady jezebel who only exists in maybe
two or three universes
yeah and and and yeah and along with
that
i i did try and have some stuff where
the pharaoh was very specific like
you know you people are in the game and
so i can't have a constant
in the game die you know so that was my
my sad little out
um i really like the question who asked
it let's see here
uh there was one asked yeah everybody's
favorite creature
in the game yes shark [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the parrot
shark but also they were
great i'm bumping this one in our chat
don't forget to this this is a
one from a while ago okay thank you
for bumming that yeah
parrot sharks parrot sharks took on a
life of their own speaking of things
that don't have stats
i'm not even really sure what they are
paratroopers
um i really liked i like the image of
the kara siri
i love that you know and that it's
actually in the book that they have that
that telescoping kind of thing flesh
tank
yeah everything creature was the
screaming
i like the dolls i liked the dolls those
the the creatures that we were able to
come up and they would eat
i i was like yeah yeah you got to
control them and eat emma
[Laughter]
blow my way out of it very much like
dune
yes that was part of the reason why i
liked them i was thinking of the big
sand worms and things so it was fun
what about lion paws guy remember that
oh oh he was that's
seen this one brought up emma
[Music]
i still really want to write like a
twisted children's story like like go
the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to sleep
along the lines of the bunnies named
emma who throw themselves onto
knives that would be awesome you know
throwing yourself on knives turned into
a running theme in the game
it happened in rome it happened in
the finale you know there was a lot of
uh
i don't know what the what that says
it's like the perfect zombie
horror thing where you're seeing
something old you you're like
can i do anything about this yeah i was
just thinking about that first scene in
the juju house
with the like the kid what was it
what was like driving the kid
when we first found out that emma should
not be around children
yes oh gosh what else people are
throwing out a whole bunch of them oh i
i really like when the spiders came back
to be a portal like at first i was like
oh
no no yeah these are the spiders aren't
they
yeah i you know in one of
if i may criticize the module as written
you know they
they create a couple of really cool
creatures
like the kara siri and then they don't
show up again and i'm like you know
if you're gonna create cool stuff like
that hammer it bring it back
you know yeah have their i i wanted the
the
cults to have some consistency and have
some stuff that they sort of
you know all knew how to do that sort of
thing yeah we we still have that rp
question to deal with right yeah we got
we've got questions for dave that's a
tough question just because
isn't their thing should i teach them or
let them and i'm kind of like
give them opportunities but like we've i
remember we were
uh playing a game at jill's and one of
the players was
we we tend to just talk amongst
ourselves like that's kind of a role
play thing and
the game doesn't go forward until we've
resolved our internal stuff
another player was like this is killing
me i can't play with you guys anymore we
have to
keep moving and it's like fair enough
like
go you go do you yeah so my answer
there is for sure
the right answer there is make sure that
everybody at the table
gm and players wants to play the same
kind of game yes yeah
you know ask ask your players you know
if they want to play a dungeon crawl
and you want to run a political thriller
nobody's going to be happy
everybody's going to be frustrated yeah
they're just so yeah
there's a difference between town and
dungeon too yeah ask your
ask your players what kind of game they
want and then if that's not the game you
want to run
don't run it and if they don't want to
play the game that you want to run
you know that's find out where that
medium is or get somebody else to run or
somebody else to play
yeah because i mean i i've gotten very
fortunate i
am someone who loves digging into rp
especially stuff that is like
emotionally heavy
or i i like that sort of thing um
and i've gotten very fortunate with all
of my groups that i have found groups
that are very much into rp i don't think
it could do anything that's just
pure combat and pure you know
you play i do
yeah you play dnd yeah i don't know
how do you know how often my dnd games
have brought me
to the point of being like i need to go
and sit and have a moment
because this affected me so emotionally
like like like i play with spike as a gm
where
where his where he played who was
literally curled up against the the
bookshelves
sobbing and i came over and sat next to
him as my character sitting next to
sitting next to the npc interacting
with this moment that was so deep and
heavy that i had
like afterwards i just sat there and
went i need to breathe because this was
something
yeah so i mean yes i play d d but i play
d
i mean i prefer more rules light a
little bit because i like the rp
a hell of a lot more than i like the
combat i i've played both i've played
both because
there's there's some times where you
just go i just want to roll and i want
to hit that freaking cobalt and
not let them hit me with my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you
know and there's times you can do that
and i've timed i've played with a bunch
of dudes who just like want to go let's
roll dice and i'm like okay let's do
that
but i i try to ingest a little bit in
you know i
i will have a character and i will do
the voice or i'll do something you know
i'll do something
to get that feeling for me but i don't
have to play with the
if they don't want to do it oh well i
mean lucifer that's a tough
spot so he's also saying that you know
he asked them and they're like oh
whatever you want to do is fine
um at a certain point you know if you
don't feel like you're getting what you
want from it
then you know you have you're you're the
you're the variable that's going to
change there apparently and so
um if you're okay giving them what
you know just sort of going through the
motions of what you think they want
fine but i i really think there's a
conversation to be had around that table
that needs to go deeper than
you know sure whatever you want and
where yeah you know
if they're coming back though i mean
that's a good sign
actually yeah if they keep showing up
you're doing something right
i mean that's a good sign but also you
know sometimes people just don't talk
about things because we're
socialized to not talk about problems
until they explode
yeah so it's a fair point yes
we really are okay maybe maybe i'm
speaking to someone who is socialized
female
but we don't talk about [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] till it
just goes boom
oh no i don't i don't wait that long i
try not to but it's something that i was
very much socialized
into as someone who was who's who's a
afab
so i'm too i'm too pragmatic to to
adhere to that
it's just it's it's like after some i'm
i stick my hand in the fire like
three times and then i realize it's hot
and i have to change course
i'm a serial job quitter although not
now i'm very happy
in my job but like and it's that same
reason like i look around and i'm like
well i'm the only thing that's going to
change here so you know
um that's it's a ton i mean
if you're having fun and they're having
fun
then you know some things are going some
things are going right
if you're not having fun um
one thing marriage has taught me and and
it hasn't taught me much i assure you
because i am a
stupid student okay i was like whoa
one thing mary just taught me is ask
the communicate don't assume because
it's really easy to assume what someone
else is thinking
and they are not you know we
we think we can read people but in in
real life
there's no psychology stat there's no
like i think you're lying to me i rolled
uh and and so you know
and and if they if somebody says things
are doing okay
all you can do is take them at their
word you know and as long as you're
having fun
and you if you're not having fun that's
the conversation you have say hey i'm
not enjoying this
here's what i'd like to maybe get from
this game
how can we do that and still give you
what you want
um there was another question here
uh that said oh a question for you
guys
what other rpgs do you like or play
besides
cthulhu or d and d
i i would i think i've said this before
i i it's paranoid i don't think i
terribly care about the system
it's it it it's there's gm's that i want
to play
with as opposed to systems and a good gm
will
just just make it good i have another
system that i've played that i really
liked is numenera
um i haven't played that one but i've
heard good things it's it's
it's not that the system is like oh my
god the system but i i like
the idea of being able to play with a
lot of different kinds of worlds and
things like that
is that a cipher system i think that's
the cypher system game
yes yes it is yes i've got i got i got a
concluded yeah somebody who knows more
than me
thomas j really neat thing about yeah
thomas ran it at a con
for the company there i i think the
really neat thing about that game
is that the gm doesn't roll any dice
the gm just gives the players roles and
they make them all and it's
yeah isn't it pretty dice easy from what
i got yeah it's a very
it's a very it's very much a slightly
crunchy story game
yeah i i actually quite like that system
money cook
that's who thomas because they gave him
a t-shirt that was a medium
so guess who has a manitoba monaco
t-shirt this girl
um speaking though of of dice light
systems i
really like monster of the week i'm
playing that on another podcast wool for
weird
and it's great like we we look at it and
go okay in this situation
my character is a spellslinger for
example and so misty is over here like
okay i want to put a shield up or try to
banish this thing
and i roll two d6s and i add my weird
stunt
and that's all there is to it it is so
very rules light and incredibly dice
light and the gm
never rolls dice and powered by the
apocalypse right that's powered by the
apocalypse
i'm actually not sure i'm not sure your
character sheet is a folio
and you click off things on it and um
you're like an archetype so here's
here's misty's
that's powered by the apocalypse yeah
yeah so that's based on the
apocalypse world system which i love
um and there's a bunch of different
games for it my wife is currently
playing in a superhero game
in that in that thing they have a system
called masks
um and it's got it you know it
it it super rules light it's just a
couple d6 for most things
and one it it does some really neat
things in the rules
depending on what system you're playing
of codifying relationships
like in the original apocalypse
world
relationship is actually a stat that you
have that is relative to all the other
players
it's called rx and so like i have a i
have an
rx with you know with emma's carrot with
emma and that sort of thing
and that that will impact if i'm doing
something with her or to her that sort
of thing
ex it's a really cool system i mean and
it codifies that a little bit because
like when we first started with
uh roll for wool for weird we were not
planning to make it a podcast but
here we are we we started off going
you know
who are these people and who are they to
be so you know this
is my this is my great grandfather we
just reconnected because he's a vampire
and he's come back into my life
actually happens on roll for weird it's
great i love it
uh yeah i like the apocalypse we have a
question from user og4r4nt228 he asks
yeah i know that was like that was epic
because they put all those interesting
characters in there
um gosh as a gm like
i want systems that get the rules out of
the way
um and that players can
understand easily because i
i you know i went to i went to a con
back when we could go to cons
and i sat down at a table to play my
buddy gill who's
one of the best gm's out there just
amazing gm he was running
a one roll engine game of thrones game
and i was like
super cool i want to play this the
the rules explanation was more than an
hour
and you know that i don't
i don't like that is too crunchy
we're trying that out right now and we
actually just kind of uh
jumped in there on a home game and it
well just ran through combat
and like here's what it's like yeah i
mean i think that's that's that's
certainly one way that you could do it
you know that's certainly one way that
you could do it it didn't take that
long is what i'm saying i'm surprised
and and i've i've actually done one
little engine a lot in the past
well con games are a different animal
and they're you know
you know explaining rules at a con is
very different than explaining rules in
a campaign game where you have
um you know you have the ability the
benefit to be able to
like introduce rules episodically or
kind of as they come up as opposed to at
a con where it's like
you want to do that i have to tell you
how to do that right now uh
yeah i the neat thing about the one
role engine
is that it's super lethal
man it's it's dangerous but i run
cthulhu or
or brp as chaosium once tried to call it
because
it just makes sense like if if i tell
you you have a 40
chance to do something like you can
understand that that that is easy to
conceptualize
i have an almost it's almost as likely
i'll do that as it is i won't you know
and that
that really helps helps especially
players who
are new to games and that sort of thing
kind of come into it uh
the more that i can get the rules out
of the way
and and let us tell the story i mean um
i mean you guys saw i don't roll a lot
at nice i don't like to
you know i don't like to let the
dice get in the way of the story either
um oh yeah ah d schwarz
uh there's so firehawk shadowchild
brings up this
german it's a german rpg system called
the dark eye
the schwa and it's like i was like what
are you doing over here in german
i know but it's this punishingly
punishingly complex like you know
your your encumbrance is algebra you
know and
and it matters and it's just oh i'm not
a fan
that's not my thing like the world and
the environment that i can understand
which is why
i'm not so much a fan of d d and i like
carbon because i
live and work in an environment kind of
like carbon 2185 where it's like
a little bit but i mean it's not when
warren would constantly look at me like
why the f
are you breaking the game and i'm like
technically i'm not breaking the game
these are things we kind of do at work
technically i'm not breaking
is that gonna be the name of our next
step yeah that's the name there it is
i'm not breaking the game yes very
fitting
i'm really interested in playing and i
have the book i haven't gotten through
it yet i'm on like page 11 because you
know i fall asleep when i'm reading
manuals
um is tales from the loop oh yeah i've
heard
anybody seen dark on netflix or
something like that it's like you're a
bunch of 80s kids except you're in a
little bit of like
a steam punky type 80s where you know
what i mean there's robots and things
that you actually interact with
and so those are the worlds that i can
get into
you know i'm like it's not hard it's not
a far stretch to be somebody in the 20s
or a kid in the 80s or
you know there's another game too that
i'm interested in playing called alice
is missing
where you're a teenager and you text
each other and try and figure out what
happened to alice
you know so these are all games that
have real life environments and you act
within the environment and so like if
you tell me to roll a die that's fine
whatever i don't care about rolling the
dice just tell me what to roll and it's
fine
but it's about the environment that we
can play in amy's two more cons away
from becoming a larper
[Laughter]
only if larping means i'm in my pajamas
hey if you're texting other people maybe
that's just i'm not sure you want to go
to those larks
um dead boy wants to see
he's like but emma and d and d would be
uh i'm so old and i've known amy so long
that i
remember non-emma dnd characters yeah
her name was marina yeah yep was that
your very first d
character yep i was a fighter so i was
your classic fighter because it was my
first dnd game ever
wow to learn the ropes and then a year
and a half into it
i became a jesus man i was some sort of
cleric
ranger who wrote a flying dog the
halfling outright
you're a halfling outrider you rode your
dog
wow into combat and the less we say
about groove master beats
yeah no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what
i want to know now that i heard that
nick's initial character in our game
in this dnt game was a cat who had a
human as a familiar
no it was it was the cat was the
familiar but the human was pretty dumb
and the cat was
the yeah the cat was like running
everything oh i love it and that's
it but then killed the human as a
warning shot to the party to not go so
yeah yeah i was like okay
i'll i'll dial it back fair enough okay
i can
that's awesome for pete's sakes that's
that's an interesting question that
dead boy will not be joining us in
season two
that's an interesting question that i
have for you guys what was your first
role-playing character
rogue oh geez i can't remember
so i played a lot of rogues i was
15 it was a different time
back when back when rocks were soft go
on first edition d
i played a fighter that didn't wear
armor and only cared about his hair
and so i would like every town we
went into i asked if there was a hair
salon that was my main thing
uh and because i was a 15 year old boy i
also wanted to find brothels
even though none of us only we only sort
of knew what brothels did
but that's where naked ladies are so i
just wanted to go there
it was okay i wore
boots of speed and vegeta
and one of the first actually i hadn't
ever thought about this about how much
the gm
chris kent like he did something that
made me
like that i would do he gave me a sword
that was an ardent feminist
and so i had this intelligent sword that
was just
constantly disgusted by me and i would
and like
something you would do yeah yeah
uh and i was like you know
at the time it just annoyed me but as i
you know as i think back on it
lessons for life so somebody uh
tamagotora asked about the
best worst tpks that any of the players
have been involved in does
destroying all the universe count i
don't know no no
not at all i usually kill my characters
off to the
side yeah like they're they're they've
like you were describing how he
ran off on the alien world and got
himself killed and like yeah i
i was kind of like i hope he doesn't die
because i really like this character but
it's like
he's not gonna make it yeah i'll be
honest for me
even even not playing games on a stream
like death needs to have a narrative
reason to me
because one of the reasons that i don't
play d and d
is that death is meaningless death in d
d
is well we gotta find diamond dust
you know it just has no meaning
whatsoever uh
but when you're playing a game where
death means something
even though i went repeatedly through
this game to show that it didn't mean
anything
uh you know it has to have
a narrative reason it can't just be like
and then somebody got shot and that was
the end of it and so
you know you do you do stuff like you
know
uh alexandra loses her voice or
you know you you do sort of things that
are traumatic
that serve a similar purpose to death
but like
somebody's deaf needs to serve the story
you say that but i can't help but
remember
your dorvan bard that you you had that
game and like
you you you had such a death wish
and like my paladin was just like
do we try to keep me alive keep you all
alive and like there were times where
it's like you were just going down and
he would like
he had he had gone through the ringer
for you and he'd be standing above you
with lay hands
just his own blood pouring down on you
like here we are
that was his his that was a bard
who's
whose instrument of choice was power
ballads and who
cooked with i think methamphetamine as a
seasoning
he oh no he we we we talked about
what is it uh
coffee for dwarves was cocaine and my
paladin at one point
yeah nice nice
but yeah i don't like tpk's is a
you know unless you're doing something
like a a mitten or something like that
where where you know you're expecting
people to die and actually
um not to not to bite the hand that
feeds me but i think one of the
structural problems with the mitten
is that it's sort of like okay keep
fighting until you die and now there's
two of you left and the three people are
sitting there you know i i think we're
starting
um the stuff thomas is starting to do i
think is going to change that and make
it more interesting but
um but unless you're doing something
like a mitten
death is like the least interesting
thing that can happen it's like i said
back in the beginning death is
absolution
you know death death death is
you know what are the what are the real
repercussions
right yeah i i think i've only been
involved in
a tpk once and i put heavy quotation
marks around it because we didn't
actually
where we were all knocked unconscious
and grinded away and
yeah fair enough but yeah it was it
was
it was it was interesting yeah there's
actually a whole section in the cthulhu
rule book that talks about like
you know like there's i don't really do
this that much partly because player
agency is up but there's a whole bunch
of cthulhu stuff that is
what happens if the party gets captured
you know and and there's
i've played games where we have to do
like the escape from the cultist scene
and that sort of thing and get our stuff
back and all that
right what somebody else asked a
question there that
uh oh um
uh it was let's see here
uh well it belongs that was agonizing
though
uh what james put us through there i was
like
it was the one that like i was freaking
out
it was it was it was difficult it was
definitely one of the more difficult
experiences that i've had in a dnd
game and yeah
that's that's the closest to a tpk that
i've ever
seen i've we all lost and we were all at
the mercy of that's as
close as yeah yeah that's as close and
that's as close to tpk as i've ever been
quite honestly were you guys have you
guys not joined the game yet when jen
jill tpked us twice i think before you
guys joined
i don't i don't think i was there are
you guys there for the pineapple of
happiness
the what you want oh no so we got tpk
once on the boat
and then we got tpk like in the very
beginning we were like third level
and we like blundered into this ambush
and just did everything wrong
thomas was there because didn't you guys
wake up at the stone again or something
yeah yeah we found out that we were
eternal and i was like my character
actually was like
i'm a god oh yeah oh i remember that
complex
[Laughter]
ezra floated around because he was a god
that he couldn't touch the ground for
like
years yeah money like by the time i was
seven
sixth or seventh level i just stopped
touching the ground i cast overland
flight every day and it would just like
float about four inches off the ground
and then i was like well
my dog can do that too so i would cast
fly on my dog and ride my flying dog
she would run she'd fly circles around
me because
um all right so we had planned for this
to be about a two-hour show
uh and i i think well do you guys
have any questions about the module
we'll
we'll we'll sort of head towards the uh
towards the end game here i mean finding
out that that
the the gorillas weren't actually part
of the module was a huge revelation for
me i genuinely thought because you'd
mentioned it with your other home game
that it was part of the module yeah me
too i i said in the chat like oh that's
totally part of the module then you
start talking i'm like ignore
see i was me because monkey pig gorilla
that's all i'm gonna say
ah yeah so the pro
one of the problems i have is that amy
and nick have been playing with me for a
long time
and i only really have like seven ideas
and so like you know
when the terra cotta warriors show up
again they're like yeah we need to find
the scroll and all you know and
um and and uh
uh you know it's it's i have to like
remember
like okay what can't i do what have i
already done with you guys
you know and that sort of thing and i
mean they're pros and they would totally
just go with whatever i did but you know
i
i can't you don't want to keep telling
like well i mean you kind of do want to
keep telling the same stories because
you like that story but
uh you need to hit different beats um
yes sir
madame lynn was part of the story and
she was
ju it says in the book turn her into
a giant gorilla the
psychopath yep it it skips that that
part
um but and she's not quite as uh
uh psychopathic as maybe as she became
as she slowly went insane
but she will she will become
attached to the player with the highest
appearance and
emma had the highest appearance since so
i just ran with it you know
never have i been happier that
alexandria is plain
[Laughter]
you know and and i think it actually
it it describes her as like she's a
wheeler dealer
there's a whole thing she like that we
kind of papered over but brady stole
a book from her yeah and that was the
book where we found out about the jade
statue and how to right
right right and and and so
uh brade you know she really wants to
find brady
uh and i was like you know is that and
and
because of because of role-playing and
things like that
that became less of her drive and emma
became more of her
drive and then taking over you
know that was
that that like when when she had a
chance to get power that was that was
a big thing for her
um i do have a question in here somebody
did ask about how to manage
hit points no yeah
make it cinematic i'm a big believer and
things have a
cinematically appropriate number of hit
points uh
you know there's a there's a whole
school of thought of like
this encounter needs to take 15 of your
resources and so on and so forth uh
you know partly
this is my you know my my uh
uh my just stupid idea but combat is the
least interesting thing almost always
that happens in games
and so you know the more you can
either make it interesting for some
reason make it matter to the characters
give it stakes
um otherwise get it over with and and
get out of there it's also why
um don't do things like you know oh
you're trying to park
make a drive roll you know that just not
only only roll dice when it matters how
are we supposed to improve our drive
we played a whole game where all thomas
wanted to do was drive a boat so
he could improve his pilot skill
he was a boat lager god damn it
um but yeah don't you like
there's you know make make fights
interesting make them matter to the
characters but don't make them
go on for a really long time and don't
you know run the table quickly like if
you're
if you're gming the biggest favor you
can do your players
is remember their initiatives and just
go boom boom boom
you know just zip through them as much
as you can and have them in order
because
that like the the mechanics of combat
kind of system agnostic here the
mechanics of combat are one of the
biggest drags
on anything one of one of my favorite
things that some of that some gm's do
that i've started doing
is say this person is up and this
person's on deck
yeah to make that person be like you're
up next get ready
yeah or the fact that like as a player
you should know who you follow
or some gm's go around the table so that
it's not hard to know it's coming this
way
or it's coming this way yeah it depends
if there's initiative or not but yeah
around the table yeah a lot of times in
games i'll just go around all right
reverse direction going around the table
uh that sort of thing oh how is the
duchess five years later
i some people had a suggestion that this
is mary rodgers
i just i don't see either of them being
okay with that
i don't know i mean the duchess
i mean he's an american and uh
and roger's you know he's he's he's a
very
yeah that's the thing too is he wouldn't
i mean that's one of the reasons why uh
hollister was looking into taking more
responsibility to relieving rogers of
some of it because he knew how it was
breaking him down
i it's still like things i love about
games
all of that roger stuff and all of kind
of the back half
of this all happened because nick
fumbled
that 100 that yeah that was like wow
that was amazing nick rolled nick rolled
a hundred and i was like
okay you know and now there's
somebody
following you and rogers was born and
you know we kind of went from there
there my guess is that five years later
the duchess
is on whatever boat one of the pcs is on
yeah that's right oh my god donald and
alexandra get married on a boat
no don't they would know better than to
do that
no but while we're going over to see
them we'd be honest
that's right yeah and uh
jack mackerel asks running mass at home
what's the best
best method to prepare as a gm the best
method to prepare as a gm for anything
the first step read the module
then start over and read it again
and you know take some time and like
map out what you want to do like write
down
write down story points that you know oh
you want to have happen
find the scenes that connect with you
like
i knew the juju how scene i wanted to
have happen
um i knew i knew in peru i wanted the
uh what's his name i forgot the guy's
name to take people over i wanted that
to happen
you know so like find what was what
was the drug addict's name i've
forgotten
uh that was a long time ago yeah frank
sinatra
uh mendoza yeah no mendoza was the
kara siri the english guy who was the
drug addict
who the the the guy who turned out to be
nyarlathotep
uh what was his name uh
oh geez too far in the past that guy
yeah that guy you know that guy um
here we go uh
larkin augustus larkin oh
guy with the tattoo on his chest oh yeah
the fopish englishman
heroin gosh it's been a long time yeah
but like i knew because he had the
dominate spell and i knew i wanted to
use that at some point you know and so
like find find little bits that you know
you want to have happen
um don't don't get
so connect don't get so in love with
something you know that you that you
railroad the players
be you know be be be on your
feet
enough to like go where they want to go
because they're gonna go to rome and
you're gonna have to like come up with
stuff in rome
uh or they're gonna but
read it a bunch of times there's
actually a really great
there's a whole section on the
backstory that goes through
everything the carlisle expedition did
and everything they're doing
and it gives you a timeline that that
is
great and and really useful to sort of
know okay here's when this happens
here's when that happens give your
players that calendar
and let them keep track of what day it
is that's
you know that's hugely useful and and
you know decide how much of a thing you
want that to be like uh
i liked having the game on a clock that
to me is interesting
um or you could do what they did in that
24 hour one just see how far you get in
24 hours yeah
that was insane that was nuts
so 18 o'clock should we talk a little
bit about season oh is there any other
questions or anything before well i
i had a question was there anything that
we missed
that you particularly wish no no
anything anything that we missed that
so australia has some fun stuff so
you go to australia and you end up in
this
like mine that is a city of ancient
ancient aliens and you can find some
like
ray guns and stuff like that and you can
fight some some other things
um but you know at the end of the day
it's a fun scene it has a couple
fun scenes but it's it doesn't bring
anything new
um so no i think actually
if anything i kind of wish that i had
um i'd taken in the first half of the
game
the the the stance that i took in the
second half where i was like
um you know and you have a long sea
voyage
you know i think i i l as
funny as the ideas that every time
you're on a boat something awful happens
you know that kind of grinds and it and
it can become one note and so
um you know i
if anything i might have pared it back a
little i think rome is a great example
of that you know
now don julio was awesome and that ended
up coming back and paying off in a
really cool way
and so you know sometimes that that
side jaunt will create something that
becomes awesome and will
will carry forward other times it
doesn't
you know and and i i think you know
less is more in some ways
don't don't feel like don't feel like
you have to just because it's written in
the book
you don't have to do it you know like go
find your own ways to do things um
so is that the issue with the module
though because i
you know what i mean at some point i was
also just like
okay so now that we know what we have to
do we have to find the thing
find the place do the ritual
lock the you know what i mean once we
got the four things down and did it once
it kind of felt like
how repetitive is the module where
you're just like i just basically go to
right you were saying that the book
didn't do it that way right yeah in the
book
you only do that the the capstone ritual
is specific
to egypt and it traps the black
pharaoh
um and in most cases
uh that actually happens you know that's
kind of
that's the climax of a lot of the games
okay um
because technically going by the ritual
as they have it in the book
as soon as you seal that pyramid they
can't really do what they want to do
now they've still got a big bomb and
everything you know the so the bomb is
actually part of the game
the weapon the idea is that there's a
rift in the sky and um
and not penhue the other guy
stanford not stanford the guy who we
killed off but anyway
he's going to shoot up there tear the
rift open and that's going to bring
azathoth out
you know and that's going to end the
world and and so
you know there's usually this the big
finale at grey dragon island but really
most games in in egypt with that with
that scene
um and i really thought about it but
then
you know you kind of did egypt so early
uh and you know there was also the point
of you know
you guys messed egypt up so much
that you know we needed to we
needed to figure out how to get you a
win
yes no uh
uh did i miss any questions here
from the chat i don't think so i think
we i think we went back and got him
yeah so let's let's spend a little
time
talking about season two and then let's
go home
so i am home well all right yeah uh
so season two we have decided
we're headed to the old west we're gonna
be playing
call of cthulhu down darker trails which
is call of thulu in the old west
and so the idea of this game
is i'm sort of taking the x-files
as the as the the framework for it
uh where you know there's there's gonna
be an overarching mythology but they're
gonna be monster of the week episodes
where it's just you know short hits and
so
uh the idea is that you know we're
gonna be playing in like two or three
episode
chunks of you know like this story is
being told in this contained area
and one of the things that i'm really
excited about is that this is going to
let us
have guest stars come in and play and
maybe they're only here for a couple
episodes you know
um some people you recognize from some
other quests and chaos games
want to play here thomas wants to
play so we're probably gonna have him
be a part of it because you know um
that means we'll have to figure out when
cilantro came into the old west you know
he's brought it with him from the old
country you know that actually one of
that was another favorite scene
him spraying his blood all over that
cruise ship
trying to find the guy with the hand of
glory
ah that was a good scene and of course
thomas is the reason you are called the
great dane society
yep because he meant to say great dame
because it was all women and he just
can't talk
oh man and so yeah we're gonna
have
uh and and as as i often do
we're literally gonna play the adventure
out of the book for the first one who
knows
where we'll end up but that's that's
that'll be the framework
um and so we'll be uh
you know we'll be we'll do that starting
in january but
next week we're gonna do we're gonna
do character creation we'll do that here
live
so you can you can watch us put it
all together
and and figure that stuff out uh
and yeah i'm excited i think it's gonna
be fun man i think it would be great
people are already saying who should
appear in the next
[Laughter]
sheriff mcgillicuddy and deputy rogers i
was
an annie oakley accent huh i'm not sure
if i can pull that off
although i do have a character in mind
who's kind of an annie oakley character
so
stay tuned and and so
the the goal next week is to actually
kind of teach people how to make a
character so we're going to walk through
the steps of character creation
um talking about how you can build your
character and choices you're going to
make and that sort of thing
and then we're also going to do some of
the stuff that we
have many of us have taken to doing to
sort of connect
the various groups and and how you bring
the players together
um so that you can go a little bit
beyond you meet in a bar
although now i'm just going to say you
meet in a bar i think that's going to i
mean
we have to be there in the bar we have
to meet in a solution the real question
is
is emma going to is is amy going to play
another emma
playing emma i dare you find out next
week
next week so yeah i saw there was
what did somebody else ask there that i
missed it was something about oh why
didn't we go to australia i think i
i said that that it was kind of more
of the same at that point
we meet in a saloon not a bar
i mean of course i will say so dead
boy
my my home game they just went to
australia
and man is it hard to have three
australian npcs and make them sound
distinct
like it's they're all like
wait was that was that alan said that or
was that dodge i can't tell i'm like no
that was dodge
see he's the one who like takes the g's
off oh it's
um so like i said australia has some fun
points but
you know at a certain point it's kind of
gilding the lily um
and when we
when when thomas and amy and i sort of
started talking about when
you know what kind of time frame made
sense
uh we had to just you know we had to
sort of just then
we had to start start thinking about
okay we have
so we literally had a meeting where we
said okay we have seven sessions left
what are we gonna do and um
i really actually enjoyed
that process and and looking at it from
a more
um a more producerly
viewpoint and and and
did i get everybody's things that had to
happen i can't remember i think i did
right
i mean you you hit alexandria and most
of what was happening with donald so
i mean there were two at least uh
and and i think we got silvano
so that was yours
uh and joan just wanted more power so
that was
so like at that meeting i asked
everybody what's one thing that has to
happen
for your character before we end this
story and then i was like and whatever
it is that's gonna happen
uh and and that's that's a great gmming
tool like i do that at con games
where when we take our break at the half
of the game
i ask that same question of the players
and if they
you know and whatever they say i'm like
that's gonna happen you know
where whatever you want to have happen
is gonna happen and it's
it's a way that you can the play even in
short games the players can have buy-in
and feel like they're
you know they're driving the story which
is great ah we're reliving all of the
australian mythos creations now that uh
bears as as as husband pointed out
australia doesn't need the help it's
already basically a mythos wasteland
one of one of the scenes that they had
in the home game had
was a guy just telling them all the
various ways they could die in camp and
the
their their their bushranger his final
device was my bosses just don't leave
you a tent at night if you have to pee
have a cannon in your tent you're gonna
be better off mate
that was his so so they're all terrified
of the australian
uh the australian outback also as a
uh for me personally the australia
episode has
something that i can't stand which is
random encounters
oh it does the thing i it it has like
you're gonna go on this journey and roll
a die and see what happens and that's
just
you roll the dice and you're like this
is what you come across that's what ends
up happening yes
then we say you didn't look at the dice
roll
and you say you shut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up or i'll
kill you all one of the benefits of
playing
remotely is i can you know i can just
make the role whatever i want um
although i never do oh man oh a couple
people are talking about you know well
time traveling emma and joan show up do
we have to mess with
joan and emma do we have to clean up
their messes i didn't mean
you know if nick poor nick who
like created three different characters
none of whom died and like was dreading
the moment
that we all wanted where they would all
three be in a room together
because i'll tell you as a gm like the
hardest thing to do is to have a
conversation with yourself
like it when it when it comes up and
you're just like
uh wow what i don't but um
so probably funny as that would be
you know i think we're gonna try and
avoid that stuff and let people
let people get get good at playing one
character as opposed to trying to play
several
i managed to get that out of the way
pretty early with alexandria in the same
room as doyle said
even if alexandria was in fact
unconscious and didn't have to talk to
him
it's true it's true um
gosh i i had oh that's the question all
right
so we'll start all right joan
you are going to establish the over
under and then everybody else is going
to guess
over or under so i'm going to give you a
stat you're going to give me a number
and then they're all going to think say
if it's over or under and chat you can
play 2.
so number of emmas
that emma actually had what do you think
the number is
the number of emmas that emma actually
had like a
a a sheet for or no no how many emma's
remember an emma is rolling
and fumbling hold on so how many emmas
did emma have you established the number
all right
i i'm gonna say seven seven
overlook over tiana over uh
under
hard now that's why that's why i made
that number
i thought that was something so uh
amy's which again
are a failure but not a fumble uh
how many amy's did nick have uh
tiana you start the over under
uh i'm gonna say eight
by the way keeping track of this was
like the hardest thing about this game
okay you say eight all right amy over or
under
over over over nick
i'm gonna say under my thing i rolled
knicks
there's a reason they're called nicks
oh i typically rolled the same thing it
became so annoying
yeah that's that that's why we call them
nicks
uh and let's see here do i have one more
do you have the number of knicks nicks
because i think i'm gonna i would go
with five
the number of times don't have the
number of nicks came up
it took a little while for us to
recognize that phenomenon well
we will have to catch that in campaign
too it's the amy's the emmas and the
knicks
that's right i know in i think the game
before last i think i got
two like it's yeah that was something
because i remember you having two like
together and i was like it feels like
you would have somewhere between four
and five you rolled one in
um what are ezra's somebody i was about
to ask what are ezra ezra's i don't know
all right answers or don't roll dice
people are like don't forget
what oh girl ah
did i do that wow yes oh anytime you
lift up the dice you go
[Music]
no those are called birds of paradise
that's not an ezra that's a b.o.p
right there vop or andreas which
oh it depends on who you are because for
him it's
it's gotta be an andrea ah nice
[Music]
yeah we'll keep track of those those are
pretty sweet um
oh yeah i remember do you remember the
drinking game which one
they came up with a drinking game for us
and it was like every time i say
everything fine you have to drink water
yes
yes there was a whole thing i i'd
forgotten about that until somebody
mentioned it in there or every time that
you say i'd like to make you an offer
and i immediately respond with oh gods
yes i have to do that more
i forgot i i so
like running this module was one of the
hardest things i've ever done
between cast changes world reboots
just all the stuff it was and then
pandemic
and pandemic it was hard um
and like i have a natural
well no not an effort but i i see all
the ways that i could have done things
so much better
you know things like remembering the
names of npcs or
you know and or
remembering the basic timeline of the
game and and you know great you guys
were on top of stuff so you would always
remind me and that sort of thing but
like um
it was i'm looking forward to you know
not having
not having a giant you know in some ways
this module is
is somewhat fragile you know there's a
lot of stuff that has to happen and a
lot of
we balls in the air that you have to
keep in the air and
i'm looking forward to a little more
storytelling and a little more sort of
you know having a chance to
do what we want to do yes of course
lucifer reminds us this is episode
69. yeah i i will i will
um follow up on what tigerion said
though and
i know this was one of the hardest
things that you've done and there's been
a lot of
reasons why it's been difficult but this
has also been
i mean this is one of the games right
masters of gnarlethotep is one of the
iconic games and getting to play through
this game
with this group of people and have it
end
as well as it did this has been
incredible and thank you
ezra and thank you amy and qnc of course
and everyone who's been here this has
just been incredible i mean it's been
one of
the big like role-playing things for me
this has been amazing
i mean i think i said this last time
between playing and gmming
i've run this three times and this is
the first time i've finished it
congratulations congratulations very
exciting
it's very hard to finish yeah i mean we
finished
uh murder on ortix bar or an express oh
that
there will never be a better ending that
that oh
everyone was so mad at me i didn't like
it at all
it was both of you yeah i mean
it was yeah outstanding i you know he's
been getting excuse me getting all sappy
but you guys have been amazing this has
been
and this has been just a great way to
end okay emblem this is awesome guys
i would man i really even though it is
literally on rails i really like horror
on the orient express
and even though it makes no logical
sense because it's literally like
we get off the train and something
horrible happens to us and then we get
you know and somehow magically the
orient express is waiting for us this
whole time
i mean it's the old west we have to get
on a train yeah we're gonna have to get
on the train it's gonna be great
there will definitely be trains um
stagecoaches trains all that
stage coaches trains and horses but i
can't my character
i i i have to talk to you at some point
of emma
amy because because there's a character
that i kind of want to tie to yours my
secondary character who i think would be
i don't know if we could do the orient
express again
season three yes you cannot end it the
same way
so when i started running horror on
the only express for them
i was running like the old school
version that was
even more on rails and then i got the
new version
and the new version like when i was
running the original i was like oh
i'm gonna do flashbacks this will be fun
and then i got the new version
and it had flashbacks in it and i was
like oh all right well
um but the flashbacks were like the best
flashbacks
yeah flashbacks were like my favorite
part it was a
it was crazy well i i think uh
tigerian we're actually gonna have
everybody's
maybe not endearing character creation
but everybody's gonna have two
characters
uh just in case and then you know so we
can
uh we'll probably do something similar
like we did with the b
team where we can bring introduce the
new characters and have them in
and then also if we have you know if if
say thomas wants to play for a week or
something like that we can bring in
and have a rotating cast of guest stars
um
well now i have to kill him brutally
i'm gonna put it out there right now
andrea of the burbs i want you to make
us a version of the great dane city logo
with a 10 gallon hat on the dog
there you go please just i'm saving you
two little ears sticking out oh my god
just take this dog and put a
10 gallon hat right there yeah
oh yeah i could use that i could have
used the the
coaster should be on your desk well but
this
you know i just wanted to show off my
wife's handiwork yeah there's good stuff
i i always enjoy her stuff oh somebody
said with a bandana that would be good
too
oh yeah that's good without you antenna
lucifer oh yes thank you um
yeah i don't know any any final
thoughts
this was epic but the next one's gonna
thank you to the community yeah yeah
yeah really actually that's a great
point thank you guys for coming out here
for sticking with us the fact that 37
people have sat here and watched us
essentially
talk about our character for two hours
like my hat's off to you sad
sad souls yeah i'm
all delightful i am i am grateful to
have taken alexandria to a
fairly happy ending actually all things
considered so
i'm i'm pleased about that and i look
forward to seeing what uh
my next characters have in mind is that
you amy or thomas that is going off on
his
his scooby-doo apostasy i don't ask the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
if you if you ever get a chance to meet
thomas tell him how much you like
scrappy
do just that that row
that will start that will start a
conversation that you will want to be a
part of
i promise you my friends
oh man oh the bareness
i forgot the gi joe moment is how dare
this is actually part of thomas it's on
the gi joe moment this is part of
thomas's thing actually
um he brought this up he connected to
this um
this video of like the worst gi joe
stories i had totally forgotten
like there was an episode of the gi joe
cartoon
where cobra who like cobra wanted to
take over the world
but most of the stuff they were trying
to do was to get the money to take over
the world
and so like destro is answering the
phone
and they're trying to they convince
people to like make donations
uh for their philanthropic work and
like
um and the joes are like the the joes
literally roll it and just blow up the
telethon set
it's oh it's fantastic so i guess the
the the a brief gi joe moment of the
cobra
the the wonderfulness that is the cobra
telethon
uh sorry j
matthews j.j matthews is trolling in the
um i saw that i saw that
yep muffins are fantastic so it turns
out the gi joe episode with all the pets
was actually a comment it was the image
comic series
that was it was not one of the not
one of the tv series
gotcha gotcha gotcha oh time travel yeah
sir pintor shows up in the old west
uh all right this is getting silly and i
think getting
kidding yes that's right that's right um
friends you were awesome i could not
think of a better way to spend my
saturday nights
uh you quite literally have
uh helped get me through this
shelter in place and uh
i really appreciate the saturdays that i
get to spend with each of you
and i look forward to spending more
of them and i look even more forward to
being in a room with you again sometime
soon
until then and and same to all of you
it's
you have all i am
i am by nature a a curmudgeon and i
don't
do like internet chatting and all that
stuff but
the discord community that quests and
chaos has
has been so awesome and
uh i just enjoy being part of it and uh
that is
very uncharacteristic for me and it's a
testament to
the family and community that thomas and
amy have built
over gosh it's almost it's more than two
years now right
yes i i was seeing like a
a reminder of like the first time we
played gloomhaven
way back wow someday tossy and james
someday
can i can i plug something real quick
before we say goodnight for this oh yeah
man i forgot totally
so on on the same vein
as call of cthulhu tom who we miss
very much from gds
and a few other faces that you may
recognize from the discord and i
are doing a podcast it is called the
redacted reports
it is a delta green real play
podcast and it's a little more edited
and produced than any of the other
podcasts that you may be familiar with
with qnc
because i got my hands on it and got
a little bit obsessive a little bit
so there are music cues there are sound
effects there's all of the little things
i take out the
the parts where we go a little bit too
far afield and put those into the
outtakes because
those are fun but take away from the
story and uh
we have been we've been lucky enough to
hear some of this
it's fantastic i'm really excited about
it because
i mean we have seth we have ben who are
squeal the bard uh
seth is ngc 457 and then tom is the
handler i play i'm one of the players
and then we got tom's cousin
uh joseph into play with us and we have
an amazing chemistry and what's really
fun about it for me is that we are
all we we are players who are playing
professionals and so we handle things in
a very professional way it might be one
of the most serious quick unc
podcasts you'll ever hear we have silly
moments but there are few
but they're more because rooster likes
no really it's oh it's so good
but i'm i've been having a lot of fun
editing it and putting it together
and i'm excited that it's finally
live and in color um
it's gonna it's gonna be great i'm
really excited about it check it out the
episodes are like an hour to an hour 15
each so they're pretty
um consumable
yeah they're like chips the launch day
days
the launch date theoretically should be
wednesday
the 16th i believe the day if the button
is clicked that's right
well he's allowed to click the button
here's the thing i have officially
uh released episode zero because that
was what was required to do in order to
submit it to like spotify and itunes and
google play and all of the rest of it so
we'll see when episode zero actually
comes out but the first three episodes
will be releasing
all on december 23rd
so you guys can have a heck of a lot
of content to listen to on the 23rd
merry christmas from delta green mary
cthulhu loomis very good food
while we're plugging things i'm gonna
mainly from my accountability
i'm gonna say that i am also
releasing a podcast

and the plan so i recorded my first
episode with
uh eugenio vargas who is the storyteller

the outstanding stream game into the
motherlands
um which is a really good they're
actually making the game
system as they're playing which is
really cool there's a whole
development team not the player but
they're they're they created the game
system for this really cool cipher of
tier is doing it and a bunch of really
neat people
um and so it's essentially just me
spending
an hour to an hour and a half talking
with gm's about gmming
and it's called keep the game moving
and it is i'm gonna release the a
eugenio one
probably next week and then uh

favorite parts of big bad con is a
big bad con the best gaming convention
in the bay area bar none they
actually have a charity booth
