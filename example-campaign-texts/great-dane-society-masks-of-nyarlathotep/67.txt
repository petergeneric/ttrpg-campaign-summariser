if you want to
but don't give wizards money give money
to nord games they make
excellent stuff for 5e and
it's a way to not give that awful
company more money and to give it to
people like spike

chris chris from nord chris from

stuff go to nord games if you use our

the original one with the coffee and the
alcohol all over it

is because they've been erased so many
times
uh as always we have a full week
of entertainment here for you on quests

great dane of ice fire peak that's right
so so we're actually going to fight a
massive dog at the end of all

say it again
i actually got to say it to him today to
his face he he hadn't heard it so thanks
for watching james
uh i really love the way that james runs
a table he's a he's a really fun gm
uh he knows he knows how to make a
character pop
so his npcs are instantly uh
uh sort of they they instantly are
recognizable which is fabulous
tuesday this tuesday it's a special the
chaos agents
once again thanks to their union
contracts are taking a week off
and instead we have an
actual one shot i'm pretty sure um
featuring the the best christmas movie
ever made
it is a an homage to die hard uh
we have namatoki's tower is happening
and
and i think let me see if i get these
players right we have squeal the bard
playing

night off
thomas gets to come in and play instead
thomas is playing and there's only four
right
four hello and who's gm'ing aaron aaron
oh nice and he's going to do it
i'm pretty sure that the gremlins is the
best christmas movie
no gremlins 2 is the best christmas
gremlins two is better than gremlins
and you have a problem with muffins you
know i don't trust your taste in
anything
um so yeah tuesday it's gonna be
namatoki's tower
uh a special a quest in chaos special
event
next on a very special chaos agents
don't go in that bike store dudley
that's like three people from the 70s
got that joke
in there because i don't see a crossover
uh someone in discord is going to post a
really disturbing
thing about that joke i'm sure of it uh
and then saturday it's our double header
starting off
at 1 30 with the uh
rime of the frost maiden frost maidens
is that one plural
or something no it's just frost maiden
one major no it's just one dragon and
one frost maiden
we're also giving this away this week so
there's the actual proof you have
something to give away
and is that that's on saturday we're
giving that away i think so
and it says singular lady made
there we go so we will be you can you
can
give a copy of the you can get a copy of
this game and read ahead
and see how james is changing everything
drastically
the answer is usually drastically
probably probably
uh so first 130 rhyme of the frost
maiden
then a short break and then we're
in here
uh as we wind down the great dane
society
uh to ooh to where it's heading
so i think it's time for america's
favorite segment
let's watch amy do math okay the math is
easy guys so
oh stop everybody okay so um
i'm gonna go in order i'm gonna go in
chronological order as things have
happened
um 500 to the players from tamagoto so
we start with four
yeah and then we get one from tamagoto
for to go full emma
thank you so much tamagotora you are you
are a stalwart
yep thank you our favorite twitch
user squirrel on the run
500 to the players i'm gonna make you
eat more turkey
i do is it really do you have to make
her eat more turkey or is it just going
to happen anyway
uh she's not a huge fan of turkey me
neither so good thing
is left am i the only turkey person nope
nope nope i love you
person nick i prefer ham over turkey and
pretty much everything i
like turkey turkey abraham okay so
tamagotora
give it and take it away a thousand
to ezra
what was it just in case he needs a tpk
oh
why he doesn't need the help it's almost
the holiday season and what better gift
is there
he has a nuclear bomb he doesn't need
bits he has
multiple nuclear bombs all you have to
do is give these back to emma and
there's a guaranteed tpk
it's just through if these were
explosives job well done
okay then where are we so yep slide the
top a thousand to the players thank you
i i think i i'm pretty sure he's giving
those under duress like
sliding top blink twice if you're not
okay
like if there's a crowbar in the room
[Laughter]
there's anyways put a smiley face emoji
in the discard and we'll come we'll send
somebody
i was going to say we know there's a
crowbar in the room it's right here
there always is okay j matthews 85
probably wanted ezra's second third
twitch favorite twitch players um
yeah to finish us thanks j matthews for
being a friend and i think i got
everybody right
thank you so much for all the bits that
is always crazy and
the death threats there are at least you
know three times when i think the only
way the players have survived is bits
so yes you you're it's on all of your
heads that we're still doing this damn
it
it's it's it's a combination of the bits
and the bad guys rolling fumbles at the
best times
that is that is also true that's also
true
um so yeah that
we really appreciate all of the bits the
likes the subscribes
every everything that you do to support
this community makes such a huge
difference
uh it's it's what lets
us do what we're doing and do it in the
nominally professional way that when
we're in studio
we can do it when we're not in studio
and you know mike
my camera gets the barbara walters
filter over it i can i can feel like
thomas and amy dying on the inside as
i'm like it looks like there's vaseline
on my lens you know
it's the video professionals just
will not
uh will not take it well but um
you know it's what gives us the awesome
studio and lets us
play board games and so your support
means the world to us uh
and you know it's it's it also
this sounds weird but it also just like
it's nice to know
that people like what you're doing you
know that it is
the feedback the the sort of the
positive feedback loop not just from the
bits but from discord and
and from you know seeing the way that
like stories from these games that
you know people are still talking about
stuff that happened in the chaos agents
in episode three that's true you know or
they're still talking about the time
uh that ruckus died and that's you
know so those
those that that that feedback and that
sort of
uh commune with our community is is
uh speaking for myself it's it's
a pleasant a surprise i wasn't expecting
that
it would mean as much to me as it does
and it's really amazing and
uh i can't say enough about the amazing
community
uh that is everywhere and they're making
amy do more math
no i think this i don't understand
what's happening thomas can you explain
this to me
i don't ask those sorts well when when
you
add two numbers together they make a
they make a baby number
[Laughter]
i feel like that's was that like stuff
that already happened
i was about to make a weird like
flatland
joke for the for the edwin abbott fans
out there
wow deep cut there yeah
i had to read that for like sixth grade
math and i was like why am i reading in
math
yep stream elements is way behind so i
see you there we go
all right um
although technically really streamlands
geometry which is
not math as i had a math professor
explain to me uh
whatever so last episode
some things were said some mistakes were
made
you know we we all wish things had gone
differently
but they didn't so here we are in the
volcano lair
of carl stanford with deep ones and
weird spider things all over
some sort of awful space rocket
uh missile thing in the down and
on the floor and carl stanford
invited you all to dinner and
uh you left japan without
telling the japanese what your plan was
so
that's not true well taro is here
wouldn't be with us and he would
definitely he's the kind of person who
would tell his superiors yeah
it'll be interesting to see what what
he has told his
supervisors and what he hasn't um
and you you had a lovely dinner where
stanford told you
his crazy plan and
he started to show you around and then
as most things do with the great dane
society
it turned into trying to kill somebody
and joan was able to through the right
of transference
send stomach bile and give carl
stanford a
serious case of heartburn and
he did not enjoy that and he started
to go and and he he he panicked and
he was moving on
and alexandra would not let him
go anywhere and was following him and he
was becoming more and more agitated and
he
he kept referring to how he had to go
talk to somebody
uh and all of a sudden uh
he started to vomit copious amounts of
blood
just a a a stream of blood seemingly
not stopping pouring out of his mouth
um he had opened a portal
to somewhere
and tried to get alexandra to go through
it she was not she was not willing to go
uh and meanwhile emma
and dr hollister had started making a
beeline for the the weapon down on
the floor
with who knows what sort of crazy plan
and stanford before he started
to meet his end
had blown his i guess it's a spider
whistle i don't know
um his silent whistle that seemed to
summon his minions
and um
hundreds of things had started to climb
up the wall
or or the deep ones were coming up the
path um
it was they were all they were all
heading towards that
and uh
well do you want to do this next
one amy this this last
bits here yeah i flung my thing out
of them on my hand so um
the deadboy42 has given 500 bits to emma
but she must do math to save the society
and then ngc 457 says
we're doomed yeah and i also agree we're
pretty much doomed because you know
math hi mxl thank you for joining us
and mxl makes the point that those bits
you know really
those are coming from mom too and uh
it's
it's so glad that both of you could
join us
tonight that's yeah that's awesome
really good to have you guys along
uh so yeah we are in this whole
mess right now and uh
uh we ended you hear a familiar voice
uh actually not so much here as
feel before we start all right i was
about to say we hear a familiar voice
the baroness
the best oh man that's who i should have
oh
well it's not gotten the baroness to
record this it could have been an audio
cameo
oh man he's already had one speaking
line we had to get her into sag after
that
yeah that's right that's like she she
started a whole episode she's
and then 500 to the players so we're
good thank you
oh well the bear the baroness my
all-time favorite twitch user there
there will never be another
there will never be another number one
um
and damn if i'd known that i would
have gotten a gi
do i have a gi joe moment off the top of
my head this whole layer is a gi joe
moment
i want to oh man dead boy
dead deadboy42 and i might have to argue
here because he just said sergeant
slaughter is the best member of the joes
and that is that is distinctly not true
he's not even like
he's not even the best bad member of the
gi
oh the it's i mean flint is the best
of the gi joes clearly although i always
liked
oh god yeah flint is probably my
he also had the coolest gun the like
shot off shotgun
the parrot was the best member i mean
yeah sure leave ended up being a a a
fabulous
member i was never i never got into
the ninja guys
so like what was it snake eyes
uh i mean the best characters were tomax
and zaymond because that's just such a
bunker's idea
the twins that feel each other's pain i
remember
you using that oh they're the best you
punch toemacs and zeymot goes flying
it's like super it's almost like an
improv game that you'd play like when
you were taking an improv class like
whatever you do to this person happens
to that person and like
it was very silly but i
i still i still think my favorite was
that the baroness
in g.i joe was a master of disguise
and that master of disguise she was one
of those like the scooby-doo mask that
makes you look totally different
and so like in the comics the baroness
actually pretends to be a black woman
for like three episodes for three issues
of the comic
and no and then she just pulls off the
mask and they're like
what i don't know how
how is this very european very
aristocratic woman like that's the
the the accent must have been a a
challenge there or
it was incredibly inappropriate which
given that it was the 80s
you know probably that last bunch of gi
joe is is
already incredibly inappropriate uh
but thank you the baroness even when you
give the players bits you are still
my favorite twitch user
you know maybe if you gave me bits every
oh i'm suddenly deeply uncomfortable
there's gonna be a turkey under your
well there's usually a turkey on my
pillow
[Laughter]
all right whoo ezra you're getting more
bits
i should give them to the players
because they called me erza
[Laughter]
uh thank you for shito chic
that is awesome uh
uh and i'm glad that you're listening to
the podcast those podcasts
only happen because tiana does all the
work to make them happen
um including trying to get nick to
change his
uh intro for all of his different
characters every time
every time he changes character i'm just
like nick why are you doing this to you
you're doing this to yourself i hate
recording those so much
stop changing characters so for my next
character
one of them actually say like i'm nick i
play solano what do you want me to say
no no it was it was i i i'm nick i
play silvano and i have no idea what i'm
doing
there you go that's right yeah uh
so tiana thank you for the work you do
on all the podcasts she is our
she is our audio guru and that uh
that it really makes a difference and
we've had to change
podcast hosts like i think twice because
so many people are downloading them
which is awesome
uh keep enjoying the podcast there
will be all sorts of fun stuff coming
there yeah all right so
um volcano lair volcano
uh as you all
feel this voice you don't hear it you
like feel it
um and it is the voice of an old friend
and she says oh stanford
you've outlived your usefulness to me
your ego
brought these idiots here emma destroys
everything she comes in contact with and
you brought her here
so i have to end you
stanford and now it's almost like she's
uh she is now you feel like she's she's
saying something to you guys
stanford wanted to rule the world but i
don't want to rule the world
this world this world is awful why would
i
there's pain and suffering everywhere i
want to reshape the world
you all taught me about the multiverse
and now
i will use this beautiful weapon to
create
blood magic writ large cities
of blood will allow me to build the
world i want
picking and choosing bits and pieces
from all
of the different worlds to make the
right one
the world i deserve i'm going to make
myself
a constant i'm going to make myself the
constant
it's not breakfast time so it must be
time for blood magic
and you are bringing me so much blood
i've consulted the cards and they told
me
that i should let you leave so you have
one chance to go
before you become a material component
to the most
damn it and stanford drops to his knees
and then flops down on his face and just
the puddle of blood is still
i grab hollister and i'm booking it out
of there
so where are you headed towards yeah i
so the only way i know to get up is the
spiral stairs the spiral you're heading
out of the volcano
yes okay yes you're not heading down
towards the weapon you're heading up
okay i'm i'm gonna back up so that i'm
not getting the
widening pool of blood on my shoes and
look back at joan
who was that that was lady jezebel
i remember emma and i told you about
the other world yes
uh she was part of our group in that
other world
oh and gotta got a taste for blood magic
but if she's not a constant how she here
well it looks like we have two choices
get out of here
or go destroy that weapon
we need to destroy the weapon we can't
leave her with it
so you both run to the t intersection
past the dining room and you come out
into the main hallway
and you see far ahead
uh you see up heading up
emma and hollister emma
wally what's go what's going on
get back here
[Music]
am i getting tug award now you're too
far away but emma is definitely pulling
you
up like we should leave i mean she's
gonna blow this place up
no she's not she's going to use it oh
hollister you we gotta you've got to
disable this thing i don't know how to
i pointed alexandria she's the only one
who understands it
well i just like
but you're the man here
do i hear that do i hear that
[Laughter]
emma get your chaotic ass down here
i'm a therapist
[Laughter]
i'm a surgeon
i turn hollister around and i keep but
now i push him down the hit down the
hill or whatever
all right so you start to you turn
around and start to head back
um
and you hear you hit almost like
in an offhand just sort of way
um you hear lady jezebel say
are you still here
i ch i check from my eyes um
you all wake up on a
you are in a looks like a cave
uh you are in a a uh
a cave that you're on like these awful
like metal cots
that seem like they are designed for not
you
uh and um
[Music]
you
as you you know you you have all your
equipment and everything there it's okay
we're wearing our clothes and stuff
okay yeah is taro with us no
taro is not with you and does it seem
like the same cave or
well again the the stone seems different
okay all right we got to figure out
where we are
yeah i mean a floor in the in the other
layer was not metal
definitely yeah so the floor is metal
and these things are metal
i'm going to get up and start looking
around after patting myself down for my
weapon ring
all light what's the what's the light
situation
here so there are lights set into the
ceiling and they are quite bright
um does this look like an autopsy room
no it looks like this is supposed to i
mean you know these
well i don't know i mean they're metal
beds but it seems like this is supposed
to be something comforting
oh okay because i was thinking a bunch
of metal beds and bright lights
it might be comforting for someone with
a very different body
when you are as you are starting to sit
up a
hole opens in one of the walls
and standing there is a
um an utterly nondescript man
in a gray suit
no not tidwell
no it's not it is definitely not tidwell
okay just had to check
hello where are we good morning
fellow earth humans
hello earth human yeah
sure we're all earth humans here
yes we are
we don't know exactly
we fell asleep and woke up here who are
you
my name is johnson
johnson huh yes that
professor you can call me professor
professor you can call me doctor
doctor
i get i'm gonna get off the cot and go
up to him
and pick up his hand like does if i go
to shake his hand does he offer it or do
i have to get it no you like walk up
with your hand out and he just sort of
looks at it
cocking his head okay and then he looks
at you
and he says yes
oh i'm emma and i grab his hand and do
this
like do the shaking his hand is totally
cold
it's like clammy and cold okay is it
plasticky is it flexible is it does it
feel like skin or does it feel like
it feels like skin it feels like skin
but it is clammy and cold
okay and sort of alarmingly lumpy
it feels like there's lumps in there
okay hello emma
and i just take a couple steps back your
proximity and touch
do not make me uncomfortable
that's how earth humans say hello i'm
alexandria
of course it is uh-huh any earth human
would know that
we are in
sure in the desert this doesn't look
we are in a building
you do not this does not seem like the
desert
no we are
in the arctic all right
so i don't see any windows we only
see this one little door
how did why are we here tell us why
we're here
how about that i do not know fellow
earth human
what are you doing here you would tell
me why you
are here then why are you here then why
are you
here i live here in the arctic
why are you here in the arctic you look
very underdressed to be in these
yeah no we're not believing a damn thing
you say now
tell us where we are
now we are in the arctic
okay and let's go outside let's go come
on
let's go there is no outside
if we're in the arctic if we are in a
building in the arctic then there is an
outside
so one of these things isn't true we are
hermetically sealed
in the arctic there would still be an
outside
oh there is an outside
and i am given to understand it is quite
cold
probably okay so how long have you
been here
fellow earth being
ah you're awfully grown up for seven
days
is that a compliment yes
an observation thank you i appreciate
your kind words
they have affirmed my humanity
great we have a connection now let's go
find
other humans would you show us i would
well
more importantly how if if we wanted to
leave the arctic
and go back to another place on earth
and we didn't know how we got here would
you have any suggestions for that
we are very concerned that you suddenly
appeared who's we
my fellow earth humans are uncertain
if you are actually earth humans
oh yes we are yes ah that is exactly
what someone who was not
an earth human would say okay listen i
was born
in new york all right is that
no no earth human wouldn't know new york
well of course new york and china might
not know about new york yes they
would i am from china you're not helping
obviously obviously we meet the other
humans
thank you yes let's go you are in
quarantine ah
a okay well then we require
earth human food blankets
and supplies and
restrooms happy nights radio
excuse me i must go consult
with our chef and he steps backwards
so it looks available it's just a closed
alcove
okay so he could literally step back
into a closet yep
yeah so what did you feel in his hands
it
feel like skin but it's i mean he feels
like a human
well not really i mean he feels like a
lumpy
dead human
he could be possessed he could be
possessed
i don't think it's a human at all what
it looks human
it looks human but it could be possessed
by something else
well we've seen that the black pharaoh
looked human
sort of yes did you touch him
the black pharaoh i think so yeah i
don't know not that kind of game
[Laughter]
different different kind of touch emma
sit down
uh the door opens again okay and he is
holding
i have earth human food for my earth
human friends
i will have to closely inspect this
pasta no no forks or spoons or anything
yeah there are no utensils how does it
smell
is it it smells fantastic
i'm gonna texture test i'll rub some on
my skin to see if there's any reaction
so the texture feels okay of the noodle
um the smell is spot on
but it doesn't do anything to like i
don't have any sort of allergic reaction
to it on my skin
if i wake no no it it
it seems like very normal pasta and he
will say
may i join you in some earth human food
if we had some utensils ways to eat it
we almost haven't share it yeah plates
and utensils
i must consult with my chef and he like
so he walks backwards without looking
into the little closet
he just like do we just want to help him
i'm gonna go over and like poke at the
at the thing and see if there's any way
to like
lift it or activate it from the inside
you don't see any seams
oh i know how to do this
[Laughter]
we must be in the future and we're told
that in the future
how you open the door asking for a
shakespeare phone
yes yes
when you clap the door opens are you
serious it comes back out
with what looked like
chopsticks and uh
uh and flat plates
and he says of course plates and
utensils just
as you described them so i'm gonna slide
into the room
into the little closet okay he does not
react at all
um it is a closed room it appears that
it
goes up there's like a shaft above you
and there's no like i'm touching the
wall there's nothing to activate the
door
no there is nothing make me a listen
roll
um 82 probably wherever my character
sheet is probably not
l for listen that's not library nope
my list is 53 so now i mean you've got
you've got a bunch of inspiration if
you want to use it
use it yeah okay all right do it roll it
back
what did i say let's see three all right
i'm gonna try some different days
oh 94 so much better well it's not a
fumble
so when you clap the echo like goes up
the up the shaft and when you clap he
notices you
and he says please remain in the
quarantine area
fellow earth human oh but what's up
there
the non-quarantine area is that where
yes do i
notice his shifty eyes yeah yeah it's
um how long before i can go up there
if you say well uh
it will depend on how soon you die
meg pardon if you have brought any sort
of communicable disease here
you will probably die within the next
wow okay very specific and very healthy
and i take lots of showers
do you i believe that yeah
all right i exercise regularly so i'm
going to try a little bit of this
pasta it tastes surprisingly good and
surprisingly authentic
wow we could use the chopsticks to twirl
in is he going to eat with us
hollister are you where are you from
you live in dc but i think i'm from
washington
yeah so you've now been to italy this is
not italian pasta
this tastes like kind of american
italian food
i'm not a food snub no it tastes quite
good it's hard to eat with the
chopsticks
but you see
i want to go into the little room too
and like look up to see if there's all
right
with both of you in there it's quite
crowded right i'm i'm still trying to
get
uh our friend johnson
johnson says his name johnson johnson
that is a typical earth human name
yes johnson why don't you eat some here
have some have some with us
of course plump
he puts his hand in the pasta and just
like puts it in his mouth
you didn't use the utensils man
of course i forgot for you for your turn
yeah earth human one
i guess if we're if we're being casual
he like spits it all out
and then he goes and he takes one
chopstick in each hand
this is typical earth human behavior
oh no if he if he looks at me i'm
shoveling because it's so difficult to
use the shot i was more like this i get
on
i'm just kind of like he looks at you
and then he will do that and he'll just
like now his face is covered
in pasta sauce and everybody can make
a spot
let me know if you get a hard success
just regular
pretty cool all right i got a 10. um
with a critical success
where there's pasta sauce which sort of
is giving his face
um some texture you would swear
there's like slight
movement
and he's not even trying to wipe his
face
so we've known each other for what three
four minutes now we're close right
this earth humans build bonds of
friendship
that we do can't help but notice you
keep referring
to the earth humans just got me
wondering uh
do you know if humans from any other
planets that aren't earth
just curious just curious if you knew
any you
are pulling my fully functional and
normally human leg
emma alex his face is wiggling
yeah i know so was his hand get my come
on
uh i'm gonna say alexandra make me a
size roll
uh sure wait what's my size wait how big
am i
i'm a i'm a 60. i'm a 60 as well
wow i'm literally both of y'all i'm a
uh that was a critical success 12. all
right so you are able to like
shimmy your shoulders on one end of the
pat
of the the thing and your legs and
you're kind of
inching your way up this okay
it's like inchworm up it's slow i'm sure
it hurts like the devil but
it's not fun it's not fun um
uh and meanwhile yeah you guys are
distracting him as he engages in
conversation
he says tell me do either of you
feel any sickness no
i'm feeling really good especially after
having a little bit of this food thank
you
due to the unique properties of the
arctic
you would die if you had any sort of
disease in your system after six hours
wow this is why we don't normally go
to the arctic that makes sense so
why are you guys here did you find
[Music]
yes there is ice in the arctic this is
what we have discovered
well we knew that but did you find
something in the ice i'm very
fascinated with discoveries made by
digging
or yeah we dig in the ice
earth human tools oh tell me
what earth human tools you think we
well if i was humans use magic
magic what is that earth human
friend knowledge that is typically
outside of our realm of understanding
generally
stemming from elder beings
that sounds very interesting
does joan want to jump in here
[Laughter]
just heard just heard that uh
stories there are a lot of stories that
we have about
uh creatures
who come from other worlds who bring
magic
to our shores have you heard any of
those
everything i have heard about magic is
what we earth humans call
ah it seems more dangerous than it is
worth oh so you have some tails and
i was once approached to do magic
and i said no because that is not
something earth humans do
that is the end of my earth human tail
well i'm glad you said no that sounds
great
very responsible very responsible
is alexandria getting farther off so
she is getting up you you've you've
definitely made it
you know 20 30 feet up it's slow going
and you see uh
about a little ways up ahead of you it
looks like there's some sort of
junction with a side shaft
of this make me a luck roll alexandra
um also tamagotory gave us 500 bits to
to
we're digging ah yes so
i will i i will ask our friend johnson
about it's like yeah you're talking
about different things that we use
for for digging when i things are
very far down in the rock sometimes we
have to
explode the rock we have to to to uh
blow it up do you do you do you guys
have some of that
here
yes using weapons for functions
other than offensive or defensive
capabilities
can be quite useful yes yes they can
what sort of weapons do you have
oh is my revolver still on me yeah yeah
yep this is the least you've ever seen
yeah it's it's an older one but i like
the charm of it
yes i really i really like this one you
can also use it for
for other things other than weaponry
like you were saying
i could use it to to
maybe dig a little and i'm gonna bang
into the into the floor with it
uh all right yeah you hit the metal and
there is a horrible metal on metal sound
does he react at all oh actually
uh so you hit the metal and there's a
horrible sound
and johnson like collapses onto the
ground
rising and like has his hands
he's sort of like trying to hold himself
together
not going to help hands off for this one
and as soon as the sound stops he
says
that was a terrible noise are you okay
of course i'm sorry for the horrible
noise but that sometimes happens when
you're trying to to dig
this is what earth hume you we earth
humans call a cautionary tale
all right so that means i won't do that
again but you can see how you can use
for much different different phrases yes
and clearly your compatriot doctor
has formidable sonic defenses because he
was not
that's how we roll on earth you know
us
nice well have some more of the the
spaghetti that will help you
oh i am very full you should continue to
eat
do you require more sustenance um
well let's let's stop and think about
that yeah
let's go over because our dietary
our nutritional needs are as you know
wide and varied
so we might want to make a list of uh
what we might need to make
you know get us through the next six
hours right right
i mean we got there's drinks that we
could have a bunch of different kinds of
drinks
and what types of drinks and what the
what vitamins are there
oh yes so let's with water well come
come over here and let's let do we have
any paper around you do you have
anything not to write with
no we'll just talk to you let's tell you
no no you know what
we can tell you remember we can remember
we'll just tell you the kind of things
you can do you have a good memory if we
tell you things you'll be able to
remember
everything we say here is being recorded
you do not need to worry
about my memory awesome awesome
all right so well for liquids okay
water water is a basic necessity
so we're gonna each need enough water
for the five of us so you need water too
um if you're gonna be down here with us
and let's see and then
milk different kinds of because dairy
yeah and calcium is good for you vitamin
d if we had the vitamin d
uh fortified milk that would be
really good you require vitamin d
and calcium but those are those are some
of the things there's there's a whole
so many things yeah i mean you might
even want to bring just raw ingredients
and some some things that we can cook
with we want to make sure
that we're going to make it through
these six hours that's true and let's
see what so okay so we have
we have milk we have water we have oh
but and and for you know for for for
spicing things up a little bit we might
need a little alcohol um
alexandra you hear a buzzing sound in
the
um in in the shaft and emma you hear
it faintly too
and you see johnson his head
i must consult with my chef and he
starts walking no no
no no no no we haven't given you the
list yet we're gonna give you a little
stream
bacon emma are you moving out of the way
nope i'm still i'm gonna
i'm gonna make room and get in the
corner so that he's right so he
awkwardly walks in he does not seem to
acknowledge you at all
okay he just walks in backwards the door
closes and um
as soon as the door closes the door
behind you the wall does the same thing
and he walks out backwards again
that way and as he does that he sees you
and he says contamination risk
what's what's in the room backwards
behind
it's another hallway that looks like
there are
two openings one on either side and he's
looking at you now with as close as he
can get
to a surprised look on his face saying
please remain there contamination risk
and i start to i take my toe and i start
to put it out i'll be like what happens
if i do this
i'm like you know what i mean one of
these like takes off you know
all right trollers are like what
happened
if i just oh i'm not touching it i'm not
touching it
so make a dex roll okay
crud yeah this is definitely crud
oh three all right so you like
zip your hand over and you feel
more than see a sheet of flame
comes shooting down like and your your
decontamination is what will occur as
you can clearly see
fellow earth human allow me to lead you
back
into the contamination chamber
and he will start to walk forward into
the room
and the door closes behind him and the
door opens
to to the to the back to your room
and he says please enter the
contamination chamber
and i just look up at alexandria like oh
 he has not reacted at all
to alexandra being up there
uh speaking of you get to that that that
horizontal shaft
uh that is and it looks much smaller
than the other one so you can either
keep going up or you could take
this along do i see any indication that
further up there might be something
it looks like it goes a long way up okay
i'm gonna
take the chance with this one then all
right and
if it's too small for me to make it
through then i'll keep going up so so
far you're okay
um and you start to uh
go down and you keep hearing that
buzzing noise
okay and
you start to see that this is some sort
of ventilation
and there are there are
uh small metal vents that you
start to see and you come upon a room
and in that room are two um
exact copies of johnson
that are sitting at a table not doing
anything just like
just sitting facing each other not
moving
i'll watch them for a moment to see if
they blink
okay no there's no blinking no blinking
are they breathing are they doing
anything that would be
they do not appear to be breathing uh
okay i'm gonna note that and
keep crawling all right as quietly as
possible
so you crawl ahead and as you crawl
ahead you actually
you end up crawling back because you
hear a sound back in that room
and you see johnson come in
and he will look at the other two
and then there's some buzzing and then
the whole room fills with flames
and when the flames are done the three
johnsons are still there
and johnson like
you're johnson the standing one
his head looks the other two
there's a little bit more buzzing and
then he walks backwards out of the room
and the other two just sit there stay
okay like nothing was there was no
damage from the fire like none of their
suits were messed up none of their hair
huh okay
uh would it be reasonable to assume at
this point that the buzzing is them
communicating in some way
i don't know if i want to go into that
room
i i i will i am not fireproof like they
seem to be
um okay i'm gonna i'm going to explore a
little bit more because i need to know
what's going on
all right so you you come up
to another room and in this room
there is a wall of
little boxes very similar to what you
saw in
uh in in stanford's place
um and there johnson is in there
and he he is having a conversation
with someone
out loud and and he is saying
and what sort of tools would a human use
and you hear a voice say
well i used hammers
nails and uh
you know knives are pretty useful but
and what of explosives
how did you use weaponry uh
i'm a farmer um
we don't we don't blow a lot of stuff up
i i know some tree stumps that would
disagree
[Laughter]
tree stumps would beg to differ i mean
and tell me farmer
uh and that's where you hear silvano
and you clearly hear silvano's voice
going i miss milk
i like lean at this point and put my
hand on the vent to see which box that
came out of
it you can't tell there's no like the
boxes don't glow when they're speaking
but yeah i'm definitely like leaning and
looking and just like
oh is it jumping to me if you wanted
to otherwise i mean
i'd be going more about you can use it
to make alfredo sauce
yes thank you for your explanation of
pasta
it was very useful
we have a contamination breach
we believe through magical means
they do not remember they have not been
able to say
why they are here we have them in
contamination protocols
now all of us right now we don't have
bodies right that's right you are you
are a brain in a box
okay i mean people showing up with magic
that's not completely out of the
ordinary
well we carried you here you are
once you're in a suitable format
i can't tell the difference we are
so i just watching tiana's reaction
there
sorry we encountered those in delta
green they're not fun
so yeah you know uh
silvano that these are alien creatures
who live on on on the planet juggeth
and they brought you here they literally
like carry
the the canisters and
they they have created
human suits and they have bases
all over the world really
um that are you know where they will
they they are mining certain elements
that are very rare here that that are
common on earth
um they're very interested in mineral
stuff on earth and also
and we're trying to figure out why
they're worried about
human so so humans don't just show
up here though humans don't show up here
they
really the only way that humans come
here are in
jars
and so you have been spending your days
like you essentially have access to
the internet
you know you they've plugged you in and
you've just been reading
anything you want to read and learning
anything you want to
learn okay and
you've definitely felt like there's a
two-way street of information like they
are drawing information from you
although usually there's kind of a
uh there's an active and a passive where
you know they'll ask you
questions like they asked you what post
you know what food and you were
immediately like oh pasta would be
you know and and that sort of thing
but there's also kind of a passive
almost drawing of information out of you
as you
access and you've met people here
who are you know that farmer guy
is actually he he still thinks
you know that he's going back to like
old west arizona
and there's there's a roman soldier
here and you've learned you know you've
gotten to practice your latin
and you know this isn't this isn't
too bad
no no it's and none of it's flammable
you know that's an extra bonus
i mean emma would find a way but hey
so yeah this has been this has been like
a calming and and
you know weirdly restorative process for
you
do they have information on magic in
there
uh they don't really like magic
i mean it's still peak if there's
anything so
what you what you find is that they do a
lot of talking
about how you know um
it's things that are not quantifiable
are not you know are not
they don't like them they like to they
yes
[Laughter]
and they don't care for that product
well
i mean if they have any information i i
don't you know
being so they like the idea i don't have
those reservations what they have is
they have
technology that is essentially magic
you know they are these are seven foot
tall bugs
that somehow fly with one wing and
you know can wear human suits like
and totally pass as normal earth humans
oh and silvano's not dumb i don't think
he understands a lot of it but he'll
yeah no there's there's a great deal um
and it's clear
like they are very genuinely interested
in like silvano's life and his his
history
and you know they they are like you know
there's a lot of like
depends on the earth humans they love
accounting
they are very excited by you because
you're like
i'm never you know obama you found your
people
math is math is the one true con they're
just they're
you know tamagotora you can have your
500 bids back we're stuck forever if i
oh let let me tell them about taxes
[Laughter]
they'll be there for a long time they
are very confused about why humans don't
share
we have limited resources we compensate
but when we bring them here to juggeth
they are all used for the communal good
but we don't have your technology
well if if you will and and
so alexander they this this
johnson will is
is sitting in there the whole time
he's not going away so back in the room
um the door opens uh
and johnson walks in with
um some sort of white
okay start
nope in the arctic the only milk we have
is powdered ah
okay well that makes sense so you mixed
it up
you mixed up the powdered milk got it
still gonna dab some on my skin
to see if it reacts no it doesn't it
doesn't react
so johnson you said that we would you
would know for
contaminant you know what am i saying
you you know that we are contaminated if
we die in six hours
how many how long has it been for you
that we've been
exchanging words well how long were we
oh sometime all right so how close to
six hours being here are we
forgive me the six hours started
when you woke up yeah so how long
in your estimation have we since we've
been awake how long is that time for you
what's your understanding of how long
you appeared roughly eight hours ago
you have been conscious now for roughly
one hour does that seem right to me
yeah okay okay so his concept of time is
similar to what we
experience it okay so what happens if we
around
that is unclear what is the probability
well we've never had
an earth human appear here like this
we we do not understand
and i'm glancing between emma and the
door with very worried looks this whole
time
yes and so i don't see one well i'm
saying it's like it's like so now you
understand how we feel we're not feeling
very
uh satisfied helped
anything about this certain about this
situation
yes
i apologize if i have given offense
i was trying to say you know you've
never been in this situation before
neither have we
of course one key difference
how's that a key difference you
are not very sane oh
what's the scale of measurement on
sanity here my friend
we are being done as a group
how is this on a one to ten scale where
are we what what
how do you know how to how do you
evaluate like just give me some criteria
here
that's a good question yeah how do you
know that
we have very accomplished
doctors who have
actually wait he doesn't say doctor he
says we have very
uh very are accustomed
medical professionals who studied you
during your period of unconsciousness
hmm
and they were able to derive our mental
well-being
in what ways yes tell me
do you feel any un discomfort in your
uh our doctor's examinations
can at times
be somewhat invasive they went in our
all right these medical professionals
how come they can't tell how come they
contamination or not if they can go in
our brains and do all that how can they
well that is an excellent question
thank you i appreciate that could you
bring us some literature
on the methods that they used
techniques
yes writing things down is very typical
earth human behavior
printing
there is a mechanism for printing
what book would you like
i'm curious about some of your books on
your you have
the complete works of charles dickens
medical books we have the complete works
i believe there is a doctor in little
should we leroy him about the
shakespeare phone too
yeah you guys invented a shakespeare
i do not understand a telephone the
phone
that talks shakespeare to you it's from
it is what i
am starting to wonder if you are regular
earth humans
of course regular as it gets how did you
find
a phone from the future well
we didn't find it somebody told us about
that does not seem like a normal earth
human
activity do i know somebody who has
i know somebody has access to time
travel right
well i mean theoretically stanford does
clearly but um
i mean dr dr caffor
was clearly and youssef were both doing
stuff with time
magic yeah and didn't tell him john was
reading up on stuff
i was trying to read up on that yes
and silvano was was you know he was
somewhat keen on the
or was that no that was silvano who was
trying to get uh
youssef to read stuff yeah savannah
wrote the notes on that
yeah that's right right right so i
let him know i know somebody
who was studying it theoretically
of course through technological means
through magical means magic magic
does he spit when he does that oh no
there's
there are no there's no fluid involved
just uncomfortable silence whenever
that's asked
[Laughter]
would you like the complete works of
charles dickens
yes very well
i will be right back he walks backwards
into the
into the door i mean we have five hours
right yeah
well not only that too who knows what
he's gonna actually bring if it really
is going to be charles dickens or if
it's going to be
he seems very confident you know yeah
yeah i was just playing jack a dull boy
the whole time
i was suspicious about that shakespeare
phone thing anyway so
glad to see it was it was debunked
uh so tiana you stay watching this
and whenever really the only time
you hear anything is when the johnson
asked them a question and so at one
point
um during that conversation uh
uh that you couldn't hear
in the room the johnson says
and one of the heads is like
and and and this voice starts to like
explain in great detail a
somewhat antiquated printing press
process
okay and then he finishes and he says
and that is how i printed the complete
works of charles dickens
what a sad little masterpiece
okay do what
is there any way to get out of this vent
and down into the room below without the
johnson seeing me
so these vents are very small they are
not
person sized okay
all right so i'm going to have to keep
moving then but so i'm going to try to
i have no sense of spatial awareness
really but i'm going to try to mark
where this where this room is so i can
come back to it because
i am very interested all of a sudden in
silvano's
brain and about head in a box i don't
know what's going on
so yeah i'm i'm going to keep crawling
and see if i can find a way out of this
vent and into the main
hallways okay so
you'll go the path the whole this
thing
will it seems to be almost a square
but it ends before the square completes
and it it comes back around
to that room with um
uh with the two johnsons sitting in it
like a couple times
so there are openings a couple times
into that room there's only the one
opening
into the room with the brain cases
okay all right so this is a dead end
essentially
okay then i will carefully like curl in
on myself and wriggle
back around so i can get back and make
sure come on oh good 16.
all right no problem yeah i'm really
really well today
um i am going yeah i'll i'll worm around
and
crawl back toward that shaft so i can
keep going up
okay so
at a certain point when you're going up
we're going to start needing to make
like
con rolls to like not to to
to not fall a long way
because like climbing up just this
really took it out of you
yeah okay
uh so johnson comes back
and he he brings with him a
a multi-volume pristine
first edition printing
that looked like they stepped out of the
like they have they have the original um
wood cut wood etchings from the new from
when
dickens ran ran them as the news
periodicals
the episode the episodes in the
newspaper
i smell them do they smell like musty
books or do they smell like new book
ew well they're not for
smelling fortunately no
they smell like books look what you got
him to do
just think about all the other things we
could get him to do that are custom
like letting us out of here
feeling where we are actually
we are in the arctic
yeah you keep saying that i hear you
complete
works of charles dickens as you do when
you're in the arctic
yep i am glad we are all in agreement
so after the six hours can we talk to
your doctors
it is unclear oh but that's a great idea
it'd be a great idea if we could
we could you know find out a little bit
more about uh
what's in my nose that's what i want to
know about what's in my nose we have
so i should be free to walk around then
because there's nothing in my nose
that's not even i no that's how not
no i will let the doctor take this one
that's how
that's how medicine works yes they look
in your nose they look in your ears they
say everything's fine
there could be real problems in there
yes johnson
don't encourage him medical probing
through the ear canal have to be very
careful though
that's where i'll entertain him some my
medicine bag is with me
yeah oh yeah yeah you have all of your
equipment you're
you're ridiculously heavily armed
currently
so should we give should we give him a
physical
what how did i get volunteers give
johnson a physical
oh no i don't wanna no i know i know
well enough
i am in normal human health
all right i have not mysteriously
appeared
in the arctic that is concerning
behavior
are you sure because what happens if we
were always here
and all of this just showed up around us
um
correct we remained cognizant
of every moment can you say the same
i'm sure for us it was the shock of
this is watery milk i agree
what happens if we weren't out for eight
excuse that's a good question what would
we what would we roll for that yep
yep yep yep i think we should say yes
there because that's
sixth grade education i don't know
i mean here's the problem i come after
google i don't remember which is the
arctic and the antarctic
the arctics arctic is north around
alaska
alaska and that's why i'm thinking
there's a lot there yes
that's that's that's like an ice sheet
as you get up in there right
yeah but there are no volatility
there's not technically a north pole the
way that there is a south pole
i'm talking about santa claus north pole
yeah i know i'm i'm from north of north
pole
but yeah there's mount there's mountain
whatever and
[Music]
yes naming mountains a typical human
behavior
you keep saying that you keep saying
that that's not typical
quit saying that naming mountains is not
typical
no no no saying this is typical human
behavior this is typical human behavior
human behavior it's not typical earth
human behavior that's a typical earth
human behavior in the arctic come on
it's not
we know we know better than that
contamination concern
are you well you seem to be
in some distress yes being cooped up in
here
with only the complete works of charles
dickens this is an outrage
because i feel like something's going to
get someone's going to let get lit
looking for a fire machine somewhere and
and you just saying that's difficult
what do you know you don't know and
that's the problem you
don't know i'm done with you
you can go now
let's let's give her some space let's go
talk i'm sick of hearing this guy talk
i apologize if i have caused any offense
you might want to come back in like an
hour
yes i will come back and see if you are
dead in an hour
thanks and he walks backwards
um i'm feeling better about my bedside
manner
[Laughter]
so hollister and joan did you see that
when i tried to go
into there's a hallway on the other side
of this door and when i tried it
the door had closed when they were
closed there was like
so another door open behind me so
there's like a little
it looks like a closet right there and
then when this door closed
he backed up into a and he was just
walking backwards down a hallway
um and then he noticed that i was there
and i was like what are you gonna do if
i
follow you and of course i went to go
touch it you know because i'm me
and then this wall of flame came up so
like
elephant in the room is alexandria still
alive
she's up in she's up in the rafter
somewhere i don't know where she's at
but i don't smell any burning flesh so i
think we're still okay
and he might have said something he
probably said oh guess what you know
well you never know i mean but all i
know is that maybe we shouldn't
antagonize him because he may just
burn us alive he may just decontaminate
us
well that that's good to know but so
speaking of which
where is the decontamination business so
i'm looking for like
flame nozzles it does you
you know this room is all just
seamless
kind of k cave side
um almost kind of
you know like cave you bought in a
catalog
kind of do we see the like the the
devices he was talking about
recording or anything like that no mics
or anything no um
we should have asked her for some cuts
i thought we had cats fabric like
cots that are for earth humans
you start that now ollie
i wasn't kidding i was getting mad at
that guy starting to piss me off
well if they have all that knowledge why
are we only stuck with charles dickens
they don't have it or humans aren't
terribly interesting to them
charles dickens is a terribly
i'm for the call of cthulhu game stay
for the stinging literary criticism
charles dickens is is what happens when
well i'm reading charles dickens so
like it or not it's what i got have you
read some good parts
no i i enjoy some of charles dickens he
definitely gets a bit um
wording no i'm asking hollister in
character have you read dickens before
is this actually charles dickens work
yeah it is probably no yeah okay
no it is not a random that might be
funnier if it was just a random
assemblage of words
but no it is it is a seemingly
original
copy of the the complete works of
charles dickens
do you think it's worth money hollister
do we know for leaving
oh we're leaving my friend i don't care
how
we'll have to ask more about the
explosives again that was fun
i could use them as tools i don't think
they're quite that dumb
well they're not quite that human either
god i want
they don't want to see what they are why
not
discovering discovering new things
that's
why i like going out and doing
well ask him to reveal himself to you
uh tiana yes in the
in the in the room with the brain
canisters
uh the johnson says and tell me
do any of you think that a human body
would survive
the journey from yoguth back to your
planet
and there's yeah there's just a lot of
silence uh
uh you you hear a couple of brains going
uh
receptacles
i mean is is that a knowledge thing that
we can get
yeah you you know that they they
bring humans here fairly regularly
um mostly consensually no i'm
wondering like what the transport not
not not our brain
transport but the actual transportation
process and what that might do
so they have that you actually can't
learn
um they have no idea what effect space
would have
on a human on a human body
which actually was true of us until we
sent someone to space
yeah yeah okay and then savannah has
nothing to chip in
uh we very much wish to return them to
earth
but
we are only prepared to return them to
earth through
how long do you think a human body could
oh geez i think we actually know that
one couple of seconds
i mean unless you consider the brain to
be the core part of the i mean
if the brain is gone the body's kind of
irrelevant
perhaps if we dissected one of them we
could come up with a mechanism
that would keep their bodies
receptacles
and it's not like he knows it's us but
still actually he'd probably be faster
to offer us up if he knew it
like can i pick which one
um if he saw that it was one of you
he what he can't he'd be like no no no
never mind
um so alexandra what are you doing are
you gonna like you're you're heading
back to climb up
is that yeah okay um
so um
you climb up a waze and
um you find another shaft going in the
opposite direction
okay and
um this shaft has
um a uh
you go in a ways and you come out into a
um and the room there are no people
there's no
bodies in it but it is wall-to-wall of
those canisters
[Music]
a chorus of voices goes who's there what
who
what hello do i recognize any of the
voices or
no some of them are speaking foreign
languages
if anyone speaks italian i'll i'll
respond in kind
oh yeah someone will yeah someone will
definitely uh
okay do
do the do the the the people
out here come and talk to you a lot
often
there are no people here i mean patently
untrue
there are no i mean there's just the
migo
what the migo
they're are you
are you not in a canister
no
are you are you a person last time i
checked what day is today
uh well when i went to sleep it was
june 26th 1925.
1925 right i remembered that correctly
yeah 25 what
i came here
december 20th 1780.
oh and these
me go brought you here yes
they're really large bugs
and like when you say what are they you
know you get like
a bunch of people they're my friends
they're the you know all this stuff
there
they've given me so much and all you had
to sacrifice was your body
i was dying my body
i'm sorry i'm very rude my name is
alexandria what's yours
uh a hundred different names get shouted
at you
one at a time
[Laughter]
do they know you're here no why are you
here how did you get here
can you can we travel through space now
uh look my friends and i were
in a volcano lair of an evil
lord because that makes sense and
uh we were knocked unconscious and when
we woke up we were here
we don't know how we got here or where
here even is
although i heard someone mention you you
goth
yoga yes that that's that's the planet
we're on
any notion how far that is from earth
well by me go it's about an hour away
aha and by not migo
i don't think anyone's ever traveled
here not by me go
you're the first how the hell did bells
you're a you're a space woman
nope i am an earth woman and i woke up
here and i'm not thrilled about it
because i'd like to get back to earth
um you notice that the voices have
started to get
to be quiet and and it's only that one
did i catch what his name was his
name
is uh
don't use a real name don't use real
name uh
sam his name is sam okay
sam nice to meet you kind of
don't remember my last name i'm you've
been here for
god a century and a half that
wow they've taught me so much
oh what have they taught you
what haven't they taught me they've
taught me about the planets they've
taught me about
uh they've taught me about earth
they've taught me about
the rare minerals that are all over
earth
have they mentioned anything about
someone called nyarlathotep
they have and they're very concerned
because it might cut off their main
source of these minerals
yeah yeah yeah that makes sense if
uh if the world is destroyed they don't
is the the world's gonna be destroyed
and then like the people started
the world's gonna what what um
and then you hear sam say they're coming
uh so we we will be back just as soon
as
five people can use five bathrooms i
have to that still sounds weird to me
um and we will uh
see if we can't get you guys off of yoga
somehow
[Music]
so
[Music]
welcome back i want to splash quickly
over to silvano
in the jar in the neural network you
actually hear this conversation with
alexandra
is is is my migo in the room with us
yeah johnson is there
doctor professor
alexandra and emma
oh the the the brain out of body
thing
don't do that on emma and alexandria
i i know them
how the hell did they get here we are
uncertain
they appeared
and that is atypical
not normally
are you watching them yes one of them
has already left the containment area
oh god please not emma please not emma
we are we are preparing contamination
protocols
uh
is it is it emma or alexandria that are
out yes
oh don't don't contaminate decontaminate
them
can you can you cart me over to them
maybe i can tell them to go back in
very well i have told and he says
something in their language
to not decontaminate come with me
specimen 8b green and he
and he he will pick you up
uh alexandra you are the guy says
they're they're coming
hide yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna dive for
for the event that i came through
well it's up in the oh no actually sorry
um it is a passageway so yeah you you go
back in the passageway
and two johnsons come in through the
doors
and they one of them goes to the
canisters
and one of them is just sort of walking
looking around
hello fellow earth human we know you are
in here
please step forward worm warm warm
in exactly 27 seconds
all ventilation shafts on this base will
be decontaminated
it would be better if you were not in
them
i'm making like a fast mental
calculation to see if i can get back to
that shaft and just like drop
in hopes of not being immolated i don't
think i don't know how you'd get back in
the room
i have a better shot of surviving out in
the room maybe
than i do in the shaft if it gets lit on
fire
so i'm gonna come back out and just like
step out
hands slightly out all right
in three and they don't acknowledge you
in three seconds
in two seconds step further forward so
i'm not near that shaft
and yeah there is an instant like flash
of fire
in every that in that you can see
uh and as one was counting
we are to wait here while specimen eight
blue
three is brought to this chamber
tell me fellow earth human are you
doctor
professor emma or alexandria
of course i would recognize you anywhere
uh-huh and
natural earth human curiosity
this was a very dangerous act if you
have
any sort of communicable disease
or infection you could have
yeah i
wa they're contained aren't they inside
their
whatever they are we are
uncertain of the impact of human bodies
i mean if it's pretty airtight shouldn't
be able to affect it i think
no you are out the alexandria
look you can stop pretending i know i
answers
i know that we're on the planet yagaf
not sure how to pronounce that sorry
that's as close as normal
earth human vocal
capabilities can reach and you are
uh-huh and they both say it like in
unison
yeah that because that is not humans
don't do that
humans don't speak in unison practically
and if we were on another planet did you
mean to travel here
no we didn't mean to how did you travel
here
we were confronting someone
and she knocked us out and we woke up
a normal earth human
she was once upon a time i'm not sure
what she is anymore
why have you come here we didn't mean to
we have a lot to do on earth and it has
to do with
narlethotep
please do not say that name here yeah
i'm not fond of saying it
but it's i mean it would make more
sense than the black pharaoh
to you i guess
pharaohs were from egypt yes
and one aspect of the being i won't name
aspect um
a face an appearance a semblance
uh it have have you seen a jewel before
a crystal yes we manufacture them here
if you look at them they have different
faces different facets
it's like that they're they're all the
same they are they're all connected to
the same being but they're different
facets
hmm a communal consciousness
i very much doubt the bloated woman
would agree with you or
the black pharaoh but sure close enough
i guess
which one is the bloated woman doctor
is this a medical condition we should be
concerned about
no she's another aspect of the being i
will not name
and they need to be sealed away or
what's going to happen on the eclipse is
you know of the solar activity
i do we've been working very hard to try
and get things sealed up
before the solar eclipse and what do you
believe will occur
in the solar activity i mean as far as
i'm able to understand it
the end of a universe
from what the black pharaoh said older
things older beings coming in making our
little universe their home
and destroying it in the process
to keep you here
apparently one of our earthlings knows
you
savannah
no i am johnson not you the the the
earthling i
yes
eight eight eight blue three i think it
was damn i've already messed it up
oh there's something write it down yeah
no but first at first it was a
like 34 or something 37 degrees 87 and
then it became
eight blue three which i like better all
right it's eight blue three and i should
write this down
perfect
we use designations that include colors
because we have found it makes humans
uh we did not
fair enough i guess how did silvano come
to be here
he was he was offered
and he was
we found him near
death
mistreated
found his body
and prepared him for the journey
no there has recently been
well in some time period
there ceased to be regular earth humans
on the island and thus it became
difficult for our concealment
they were the fish people there and the
spiders
they were not regular earth humans no
how do you travel between
it is a great distance we fly
you you fly
yes we
in our true form we somewhat appear
and you use insect wings to fly between
planets
that's not even the strangest thing i've
heard this year
what is the strangest thing you've heard
this year oh
uh at that point another johnson walks
in
carrying one of the cases
and he says eight blue three
i believe you know this earth woman
hello
silvano oh alexandria it's so good to
hear
you it's really good to hear you
i my instinct is to ask how are you but
that seems a little banal
oh no i'm doing wonderfully
i'm so glad so it sounds like the
world isn't uh
we're trying it's and
yes it's been it's okay i'm sorry that i
well it's good to hear you
um have you learned anything
oh i'll go off on on uh
on some of the math that i've learned
yeah he starts talking about like
a whole new way of doing differential
equations and all this and
silvano i'm not a math person you know
well i i don't think i've learned
anything that would be
terribly useful to you i mean you've
definitely poked around in there like
you know
weapons files and things like that and
they have
all and they don't there's no they don't
have a concept
of like secret or anything like that so
you can find oh no
everything that's there oh
this we have found that the
connection in this brain receptacle
is at times tenuous
ah oh no i blame
i blame the scout who
performed
a a who performed an operation in the
field
under some duress well
when you're when you have to do things
fast and
one of our mechanics suggested this
and he puts the receptacle down and he
that did not seem effective does that
usually help
it has in the past a hard reboot
now please return with me to the
all right
do you have a a leader
but please let us have this discussion
in the decontamination chamber
we do not wish any harm to come to our
collection
fair enough is is there going to be fire
involved when i pass through a door
no fire is an adverse
reaction to a normal earth human
we will cleanse this room when we leave
all right and so he walks you back to
the deacon
and like every room you leave every
hallway like right behind you there's
just a
okay and i'm like looking around as
we're walking through
it's all featureless hallways
uh we are very concerned about earth
germs
do you not decorate or anything it's so
bland
decorate add color or
patterns or textures this is
color is a visual distinction typical to
normal earth humans
thing
forgive me it is it is cus
it is a it is a hard habit
fair i believe eight blue three is back
online
you see kicking it does work hey look at
that
welcome back silvano thank you all right
you all right in there you glitched for
a second it just uh
someone just posted an incredible
article that i had to
stop and
go and give it up give it a read yeah
yeah
i mean you were saying unless i heard uh
they have weapons
but like does i mean the silvano
actually know how any of that stuff
would be made or
not how it would be made but you know
you know they have
um they essentially have it's it's sort
of
biological they they grow their weapons
and they grow like these rifles that
the the ammunition is like kind of um
little spores and things ah classic
spore gun
thanks i hate it um
and they have um
they have they they have
like they they throw they they're
they have a lot of like
chemical pheromone stuff and like
gas that will knock you out and that
sort of thing well i mean
the the important thing is uh
getting them back to earth um
alexandria who who is the doctor and
who's the professor
uh professor lam and and dr hollister
i don't think you met hollister
oh yeah i don't i don't know him yeah if
you want to try the brain removal thing
wow he's he's
he's a operative with
uh i'm like glance over at the migo
well i mean don't tell me too much more
because if he dies i don't want a
savannah he's he's become a member of
the team
oh
well how did you get here
do you remember us talking about uh
bells
oh yeah that horrible woman yeah she's
she's i don't know what the hell is
going on with her
she showed up
at gray dragon island as a voice
a presence and uh
killed the ever living crap out of um
stanford lost his name for a second
there
killed it killed stanford gave us a
chance to
leave and when we didn't we went
unconscious and now we're here
hmm
she said yeah using someone to remove
the brain from their body
to see if they can transport it back and
then put it back together
anything else is this is this a
vehicle or is are we on the planet
we are in the arctic
uh at this point you come in so the door
to the contamination room
opens and alexandra and a johnson
carrying
hi and the johnson puts it on the table
and he says
i believe you know each other say hi
silvano
i thought that was a joke when you're
like say hi silvano like yeah
yeah oh
what he's
what no i mean green in a jar oh yeah
people are in jars here they they
typically don't have bodies i
keep forgetting you all have bodies
where's your body
in some state of decompos decomposition
by this point
apparently they they found him on grey
dragon island
and his body he was he was dying his
whatever whatever stanford and penhue
and those did
um he was nearly dead and they
grabbed him leaving the body behind
do you know how to
do you know what they were doing on the
island do you know how to disassemble
the bomb
that's too bad because the weapon is
easily
we got to go now problem is that
um there's not really a way
to get us back in bodies
as far as why not they have bodies
um this isn't what they actually look
like
and i have found that these forms are
easier for
so you have a corporeal
form that doesn't look like us but you
have a corporeal form so how does your
corporeal form
get to the planet earth we fly
then why can't we fly with you
it is unclear the impact of the rigors
of space on the human body
we have not conducted the appropriate
experiments
we are very enthusiastic to conduct
do you hold on so
you are able to you are able to take
the human brain and put it into these
jar things
right this the receptacle i can attest
to that
and i mean it's still a human brain the
way that they're put together well
brain brains are weird i don't deal with
them very often
i am unclear on
your question are you
could you make a bigger receptacle yes
yeah if you open that
up is silvano's brain still in there
it's not just some sort of
uh yes his brain is the flesh
the people the brain matter is the brain
matter still
in there yes just information
no you're without there is a functioning
brain in that receptacle a functioning
human brain made of human flesh
a normal earth human brain then would it
be possible to make
bigger receptacles that we would fit
into to
possibly yes
there are different parameters required
for
survival of a brain
hmm we we need to have our bodies
back on earth in order to stop what
the being i won't name is doing
we we can't just be we can't just be
brains and boxes we need to actually be
able to move around
because there's things that we need to
physically do
to help prevent this have from happening
[Music]
i mean a camera and some robot arms i
have been asking
you don't have any space friends that
well but how how do you know about
nylothotep i mean how do you know about
the black pharaoh if
they don't know about the black pharaoh
or the bloated lady they
they know about that being that they've
said not to say the name of
okay i guess it gets his attention maybe
we are an ancient race you are a young
yogath is not our home this is merely an
outpost
oh we'd like the opportunity to become
an older race
and not die although i guess if the
your the survival of your race is of
secondary importance to us
the survival of your planet is a primary
importance to us
because you need the resources as far as
i know when the eclipse happens
it's all gone this is our understanding
as well
and we're working to stop what's what's
happening
this is all highly theoretical
i mean us being out here was
beyond my wildest theories ours as well
the the physics required
the energy required to transport you
here
was immense yes
and when if we go back
we're going to have to deal with her
with lady jezebel
this name is not familiar to us but
names
all humans look rather alike to us and
sound rather alike to us
she is a she was a normal
human who dug really deep into
[Music]
the knowledge of the mythos i guess
magic she wants to turn the the
the world into a
magic is so unreliable yes it is
isn't it don't trust it i don't trust it
worth a damn
but yeah it's what we need to do to fix
things
it's an unreliable tool that slips and
cuts the hand of the user more often
than not
agreed but having a tool is better than
even a tool that's not perfect
it's very far from perfect do you have
geez i think hollister would slowly put
up his hand
say i'm like what about the spider
portal
oh and so by the way where are all the
receipts because we're running out of
money
i left all those i left i left
everything with you
i left all the receipts we we we sent in
the receipts we got
we got reimbursement or we were going to
oh always may have been
lit on fire in that one hotel in
egypt well i i i did keep your notes
though i do have
no
i probably should have burnt those
they have helped with this whole thing
they have
i want you to know that is there
something in there
cause like mr mr johnson
so i've traveled in space
you have yeah um
i didn't impact your body well i don't
know i mean
everything was fine i mean the black
pharaoh took me around and showed me
some stuff
then i met julius caesar and some other
bizarre place with a bunch of emmas i
mean
i mean why like you are madding
maddeningly imprecise in your language
yes i travel around quite often
space travel is an entirely different
matter
it is unclear there is there is no
oxygen
that's interesting the storage of oxygen
we would require
to transport four of you
our carrying capacity is somewhat
limited
fortress is not how physics works
what do you mean
we maintain a relative velocity to the
planet
breaking is very difficult when there is
no
we fly but we fly the heaviest
we have flown with is brain canisters
but what happens if there's a lot of you
carrying one thing
us
how many of the of you are there we are
does that mean something different than
i learned
i'm sorry it was an expression of
surprise
it's just five in this place but there's
more other places
yes we have we have operatives on the
earth
god if we could use if we could use
some of the magic that got us here to
get back but
why can't we spider portal
we don't have spiders i am unfamiliar
yeah none of us know how to make spider
portals i've no i've just seen it that's
all i know
i've specifically not paid attention
also it requires human parts
yeah obviously they've got human parts
somewhere what happened to the rest of
your body buddy
they left it on no this is this is
hollister okay
hollister is the one who saw them made
and all the
they just said all the body was left on
earth
we do not bring bodies here we do not
allow
any organic material outside of
receptacles that is why we are so
concerned about your appearance
how do you communicate with your friends
is only on a global scale
not on an interstellar scale so you're
not able to
i don't understand what that means so
they just yell into the wind and hope to
god somebody hears them
they don't communicate when they get
there
then they can communicate our
communication
is based on the fact that
all of our minds are connected in the
continuum
interesting
and those connections can be local
or they can be global but they do have a
range
so if just spitballing ideas here
if one of the people if one of the
your number here were to go back to
earth you could then talk to the others
on earth
and perhaps i don't know maybe grab one
of those spiders
from the island stick it in it stick it
in a jar and bring it here
talk to rogers and bring later oh that
could be
let's look at hollister i wonder what
the range on a mirror would be
that's my thought that's my thought can
we mirror to rogers
i mean so you could you know you could
ask them to try and figure out what time
you know he would say
that would be we've got metal does that
count from here i wouldn't it would be
expressing our location in a coherent
way
and whether or not that kind of magic
or they could just go get lady jezebel
bring her little brain case back here to
fix this mess
yeah good luck with that they don't know
her though
um
god that would be interesting you do
have magic
left well none
none appropriate to this and who doesn't
look there there was something that that
brought us here
and it was some kind of portal maybe
like one of the spider portals
i don't know yeah but if if one can be
thrown out here and us get thrown in
here
there's got to be a way to get back
not necessarily we
we do not understand magic neither do i
i just magic does not make sense
it does in some ways if you think about
you you are trying to to do something
you're trying to produce
something and and and getting the
materials like you would make for a
house
all you do is you make something
different that travels i mean you guys
travel through space
got it just because we don't understand
it doesn't mean that it might not be
physics
i mean a spider portal could be physics
i don't know i don't talk to spiders how
the hell do i know
the energy that would be required for
that sort of transportation over that
why what is the significance of the
nothing specific about the color of the
box on the island we were on
they had a weapon
of immense power and it glowed green
well remember it was the reactor
that was the source of power but they
were talking about making a a weapon
so that's what i have in my head yeah
but
i think we were repeatedly told that the
weapon was a byproduct of the reactor
and the reactor was a source of immense
energy
okay i believe you are charmingly
simplifyingly describing nuclear fission
nuclear fission yes it is a rudimentary
method of energy production
that is exceedingly dangerous to all
around it
it produces radioactive by-products
that what made me feel so violently ill
when i was near it
you have been exposed to radiation there
we go
i'm like getting down we used magic to
fix it
months and months ago you used magic
[Music]
to get rid of the to get rid of this
thickness
months ago and i no longer have i
haven't been exposed to it in a long
time
and all the effects were removed
still this concerns me and and
prolongs your content the need for your
contamination
[Music]
well you keep doing this we're not going
to be able to help you keep putting us
in this container
we're not going to be able to help you
guys need to go back down to the planet
and do get rid of the the reactor
lower the island
i don't know do you have that kind of
weaponry to
based on the information of our spy
there which is somewhat outdated
to effectively wage any we are not a
warlike people you wouldn't you wouldn't
need to
wage war you would just need to get
it would be a stealth mission not and
all that assault
do you not understand the implications
of blowing up a fission reactor
no i'm assuming it's just like
something's on fire then it burns down
we go to a different hotel somebody
cleans up the mess
i get new clothes that's how it works or
if you guys know what it is
you could steal it and then you could
use it for good things
perhaps
in my attempt to use human vernacular
i did not properly convey how barbaric
nuclear fission is
well as you pointed out as you pointed
there are many more effective ways to
produce
more energy than nuclear fission
that's good to know because this thing
scares
but it is not something we simply blow
up
if we have any sort of connection to
anything there
we might be able to use the right of
transference to put people's minds in
some of the things inhabiting the area
swap them with the deep ones and have
them detonate it
that wouldn't get you back well then
yeah you wouldn't come back
just spitballing yeah no that's i was
thinking yeah
the right of transference oh
magic
[Music]
i i just imagined something under the
skin rising and just like
[Music]
i want that to be the name of the next
episode if we get that far
something under the skin oh no
i mean we are willing to conduct
experiments on
potential transportation of you
to earth we wish
we are very uncomfortable with having
human bodies here
we're not terribly fond of being here in
human bodies we'd like to be back on
earth
in our human bodies if that wasn't clear
yes good i'm glad you said that
if you will allow us some time for these
experiments
eight blue three would you like to
sure very well
and he starts to walk backwards into the
so what have you burnt down since i've
been gone
i mean things we we we we can't go back
to africa
as far as ever so i've been told um
[Music]
rome yeah there's a deal with knight of
chris she now kind of
rules africa a little bit um
this this after i apparently briefly
inhabited her body
i don't remember any of this didn't we
stop her from being resurrected
she was able to manipulate some people
to do the things that she needed then
done so she came in us stabbing
that girdle with a sword yeah
oh no no showed up i'm trying no you're
right i
i stabbed the girdle with a sword you
then what happened then we went to
shanghai mess that up
never got very far oh no i was i was
there for
something yeah we unleashed those stone
tigers my
neck got broken i remember shanghai
so what was he like
i don't know do you want to tell us
about your time on the island or no
would you rather not
oh i mean i was really just being uh
did you know anything more do you know
what they were using you as a battery
for
yeah i didn't want to
okay magic requires a different power
yeah fair i was just wondering if it was
if it was anything specific
magic or they plugged they're like
charging their car off of him
it's like an onion clock or a potato
clock it's like onion
do they use onions for that now probably
not
would smell anyway
so then you ended up here we went back
and
capstone the black pharaoh into the bent
pyramid
oh nice yeah i mean not before he
brought back knight to chris
hi things happened
we got on a train went to kenya
things happened which which no one has
filled in very many details of for me
because
i remember none of this i i died
in the bent pyramid and then woke up in
tokyo
i've gotten some of the details but not
everything hmm
oh i died on great dragon island and
ended up
on suga but did you die or did your body
die
i mean that's i well
how did they get your head in a box i
uh oh jeez i looked that up you know
what i don't know you are entirely
conscious for it
like oh they have they have inc they
have this they have they use a very
powerful anesthetic
and you could watch as this horrible
creature like its arm came out and its
arm is like a surgical instrument and it
just i was
i was kind of gone at that point wasn't
i true
yeah you have you have like
flashing images of like you know feeling
no pain as your head is cut open
i i don't care to remember the
experience
i can't say as i blame you i'm sure it
was dramatic
all we need now is flynn
oh he'd be funnier what about uh
yes well as far as he was concerned he
had
finished his obligation to jackson elias
and
left
at some point i'll catch up with him
again at which point i'll probably drown
him in a river
like you do i imagine that adorable
little cottage in ireland has as
at that point johnson will come back in
we could remove your brains
and transport your bodies
in a very light stasis field
and then and once we're on earth
theoretically
probably reconnect your brains to your
why can't we just put our whole body in
stasis
[Music]
without the brain your body requires far
less in terms of
oxygen and it would be
le the radiation you would experience
and let's say you couldn't put our
it's not so bad could you
because we still need to physically get
around could you
put my brain in like
a car and i could like drive it around
i think that'd be more difficult than
rate than putting it back into a body
yeah but it would be cool i mean it
oh god suppose theoretically it is
possible
or maybe like a super body
that's made out of car parts and like
what else is cool
and like one of my arms is a claw that
grabs things and the other one
is a rocket launcher yeah exactly shoots
grenades
that's all i want that's all i want we
where do the bike tires come in here
somewhere what does emma stand for is
the question
electronic machine made for apps
yes or just mayhem
yeah uh
uh theoretically
that would be slightly simpler than
reattaching your brains to your own
spinal system
fond of my own body and spinal system i
would say though
if it could get around it could be
taller it could be
like super powerful um
emma it could wear all the good fashions
emma
um i'm just saying if this isn't an
option
let's look at plan b realistically and
like if you could pick the parts for
plan b
what would those parts be and i'd say
flamethrower grenade
maybe a third arm just to do like open
doors and just why not
how would you interface with normal
earth humans
that where would you live people people
fear what they don't
what they don't know and you would be
very different they'd set you up fire
cars on earth there are not people made
of cars
no johnson how did you get this body
because my robot
actually robots don't exist right so my
car body would be
inside a body like that body
it all makes sense now all of it i got
it let's do this
that did not make sense it makes perfect
sense
welcome welcome to emma logic
but i do i do like a car body how come i
can't
have a car body silvano you should have
a car body
i mean johnson your this human facade is
not you
right we've established that right it
doesn't need the grenade launcher
but like if i could get up and transform
and it has like a camera that i can see
with
yeah i volunteer i volunteer for this
noble experiment
or or if they can make bodies
give me that just oh wow that would be
awesome
and put my brain in another body when we
get there yeah body that's what we're
talking about yeah so it's a
it's a machine that's your body and then
you get a johnson no no no but i don't
want a machine
yeah i just yeah i just want i just want
the body part well but they're already
talking about doing that
this is not a body this is uh
this is a costume so
i mean does it look pretty good or no
does it look like crap i mean as long as
you know things as long as you don't
watch like the skin kind of move
underneath a little bit
i'm just saying that under the body
could be
a car body that looks like a human body
right
why don't we hope that plan a works out
and then discuss
plan b if that if it comes to that oh
but we should be prepared to do plan b
like i said i volunteer oh yeah i'm
excited about this grenade launcher
you're coming with us savannah i'm
uploading stuff about cars
right now i feel you do not
appropriately understand the cost of
what the car body or the the putting my
head back in my body
well yes both
but we are expending a great deal
but we're going to save the world so
there is comparatively fewer resources
used
in maintaining your own bodies
versus the resources needed to create
your car bodies
which i feel obligated to point out at
this point
are merely theoretical there are not
even diagrams
i mean we've got dr hollister here he
can probably somehow
draw out parts from
america like whoa what do you think
there i do
i anything electronic that i know
is specifically to brains i'm actually
incredibly
curious this is the worst doctor ever
i'm a medical doctor
so you should know how to car doctor
bones work
and then we just find parts of a car
that like match the bones and put them
together and make a move like the body
i think that's insanity so you're
describing insanity that
silvano doesn't have a body to go back
into
let's make him a car body let's do it
yeah yeah i volunteered i volunteered
for a car
that's i think we should do that first
and then if there could be i was
thinking that here i just uh
you want a car buddy here yeah what
would you do with it here yeah i was
gonna say dude you can't drive around
here
i can't see anything for one and if i
see something i'm gonna want to walk up
to it
or drive up to it there's nothing to be
here i've i've crawled through some
vents and
walked in and walked into a couple of
rooms and hallways it is
it is dull as far as the eye can see
there is fire so i mean it's not all oh
all of the the color
indicators for all the different i guess
it gave a more vibrant uh
what color you have shattered his
illusion
i mean this is silvano he didn't have
that many illusions left
there's nothing left for me here except
for all of this knowledge
except for all of this knowledge that
you seem to just love digging into
look if if you want to come back with us
we can get you some paint and paint the
box
i do not recommend this oh well if you
want to stay
and get some more knowledge we have to
figure out a way how we maybe can uh
go back and forth with knowledge i just
uh
is there a way we can god there's got to
be a way we can transmit knowledge back
and forth
we've got to figure that out hollister
always use a mirror i have no idea how
nope it's not very reliable though
what can you tell me about
our position here relative to earth
in case we want to set up a mirror to
see if we want to uh
wow this is going to be an interesting
google do do i remember correctly that
they're in the uh
are we just guessing because that's
where i thought the dark pharaoh took us
because if it's going to take time for
them to do their experiments
if they can get one of their agents to
send a telegram
yeah why can't they fly we have a
reflective surface
yeah we can try it out
if they're interested in speaking with
delta green
are you sure you want to introduce migo
to delta green think about that sentence
it's a terrible idea but if it gets me a
car body
yes yeah so so here's the i mean from
delta
perspective yeah like so
has he caught on to like they want they
care about the earth's resources right
yes here about the earth's resources and
not so much about they would trade
that would be epic because screw this
stupid weapon on this stupid island
oh no yes yes
9.5 billion normal earth miles
what what constellation what star system
are we in
yeah like that's just a distance from so
in the 20 you don't have a cen you know
you
you know we are in
your solar system we are orbiting your
sun
that many billion wow can i
yogurt yeah yeah pluto was discovered
i mean i'll i'll try and work with them
to narrow it down some
and then i mean it seems like they're on
pluto i mean oh my god
yeah but oh uh
would they be willing to send an agent
to send a telegram
yeah sure okay they're they'll
they're they want to do anything they
can to get you people out of here
i mean we we get that reaction a lot
another planet i can't go back to i
believe i
i i believe as i'm googling that um
pluto has not been found yet
okay so is neptune the farthest that i
know of
yeah okay and will they bring us a
mirror
why not an incredible mirror the best
mirror they can make
we do not engage in refraction
but we can make you a mirror yes yes
please
uh he'll he'll come back very shortly
with a
like it looks like it's made out of
like um
a stainless steel but it is a a
excellent you have no idea what time
it is
on earth in washington oh no it would be
a
just an urgent attempt to
contact this location as soon as
possible
can't explain if i wanted to all right
sort of messed up
we have dispatched the agent oh wait
what do you want the telegram to say
just basically urgent
and then it's just like try to contact
like i have no reference for time do you
do you actually use the term yogath in
the telegram
i i don't i think i'm simply trying to
give whatever
mathematical information to like
simply have a target for the spell all
right they'll give you
so the the coordinates they give you
make no sense to you
because we don't have really an
interstellar
uh coordinate
but could they with that also have
like distance from each planet at this
time
and then time stamp this time
so that potentially they could get we
are visible
from the northern hemisphere at this
time of year
but but multiple reference points to go
with that because if it's like we are
this far from this planet and this far
from this planet and this far from the
sun and this far from the earth
a further reference point we are the
fourth brightest stellar object
cool pretty
okay yeah all that information along
with whatever
weirdest telegram ever um
so yeah they they will they they have
dispatched the agent
um they tell you that it takes them
about an hour to fly to earth
yeah and if they can do the telegram
sure and they're also um
[Music]
you know they're also communicating with
i'm sure as soon as the agent lands on
earth they'll be like you will never
believe what
happened we have been infested
we are the infestation how do you get
rid of humans
don't feed them that's the first that's
the first rule yeah if you feed them
they just keep coming back it's like
raccoons
uh so you you
uh i guess hollister is just gonna
sit there and stare at the mirror
and read charles dickens
out loud as opposed to what was it and
what was the other guy reading back to
us
uh rebecca of sunnybrook farms yeah
tomorrow that's right
why do i remember that
um so yeah you
about four hours later
uh you look at the mirror and it's
shimmering
oh hello and
uh what oh
um let me please oh thank god let me
go get
uh captain rogers wait okay
lieutenant roger i don't remember
damn definitely yeah go with commander
that's
ambiguous and
um he doesn't
um and
you hear you hear off off screen
you hear doc professor aldridge's
voice
saying please hurry they must be very
far away
oh yeah we're out in space someone
johnson silvano can you
are you silvano can summon him no
problem and so
are you're in space yes uh
we have met an alien race
i don't know how we got here but they
are the migo
um it would be in our best interest to
open communication with them apparently
there's things from earth that they
consider be very valuable
we're establishing communications we can
try and figure out transportation after
that
no this mirror isn't going to last the
mirror's not going to last yeah
wow i thought that was a myth oh well
it's real and so you want us to enter in
negotiations with these things
yeah first thing if you can
establish communication
and then figure out a way to get us to
earth
also so there there there is a woman
named lady jezebel on earth who is very
very powerful and threw us out here
be aware you need to be aware of her she
is
very dangerous i've already got the
fleet i got the ship
the texas is heading towards grey dragon
island
i mean just blow it up right but like
and the elder sign won't help no
no if this is this is this is a
we've been studying the we've been
studying
the the blueprints you sent us and um
it's it's it's a bomb that's made to fly
well it's a bomb and a rocket it's two
things
and then oh geez how fast did he say
that it could reach a target within an
hour was that it it's it looks like it
yeah it it
this propulsion is not like anything
i've ever seen we our our
guys have ever seen we're trying to
deconstruct the blueprint and see if we
can create it but
it appears that the fuel source is not
oh blow up that island destroy it
uh how how do we get in touch with
uh these has does one of the johnsons
come in yeah he'll come in
he will come in you do communicate
through refraction
yes but apparently this is very
difficult
um johnson rogers rogers johnson
i'm not a bad joke work out a workout a
good plan for for opening communications
so they actually set up a meeting with
one of the continuum
uh on earth and
uh they will work on a plan and they um
about so essentially what's
happening is
one of them is flying back to earth
every couple hours to get a report and
then is coming back
they don't seem to sleep that you can
see
um you unfortunately are sleeping on
horrible cots oh i would have asked for
they can make fabric right
i mean if they can make pasta i make me
a bed of pasta i'll sleep on that
instead just
hold the sauce yeah they make some
they make some tech they can do some
textiles
okay so simple
cloth cut yeah yeah you you can describe
it to them and they make it quite
quickly
um so essentially
the plan that they come up with is
uh really a terrible one but um
the best thought that they have is to
try and fly
a submarine have
a bunch of migo carry a submarine to
juggeth
um and and in ensuing actually in an
ensuing communication with you hollister
rogers goes
could we just use magic do you know and
do
if you can i would love that
is that the possibility we think we have
some portal material ready so maybe we
can just transport that material to you
and you can perform the ritual
because we don't know if this submarine
thing is going to work
that's the you know that's the only
thing we've got that's built to
withstand pressure and we don't know
what the pressure's like
do we want to let them know we do magic
ah they don't like it
we might want to keep that on the
we're going to try this out before we
try that it's going to take us
about it's going to take us more than a
day to get the submarine ready so
we're going to send the portal sooner
than that
yeah i mean
if you if they if if he can describe the
if he can read off the information
oh no we need the materials yeah we need
parts we're sending in the materials
i just want to warn you the materials
okay do they bite i don't know what we
were expecting spiders
yeah i mean i wasn't expecting anything
so um
johnson will come in and he says
uh we are processing
the last remnants that were sent to you
from your earthlings we can only assume
it was food
hopefully but no they're processing it
we needed to get it
as it was we are checking it for
contaminants
okay
um so they'll bring in
a large it looks like a a a
a double of one of their receptacles
and he opens it and inside our um
four vials of green liquid
four vials of an awful looking white
liquid
and four of our four vials of like an
and instructions yes and and
um essentially you
are you are making
four individual circles on the floor
using these liquids and they have to
then the circle has to seal completely
and then you're going to do some
chanting
and then you're going to theoretically
[Laughter]
okay
we got to tell them because we got to do
you have been you have been nothing but
forthright in your
uh accountings with us we understand
that
you do not share our distrust of magic
correct and if you believe
that magic will return you to your
planet in a faster manner
we support this but we wish to be
nowhere near it
oh yeah you'll want to get some distance
yeah
there is only so much distance we can
get but we will
well then is there is there a
location you'd like to move us to
is you can control where you go
no i i mean is there another site in
this area that you'd want i mean
you could you could if there's somewhere
where we could no the decontamination
room is the safest area
if if anything goes wrong we will
decontaminate this room
uh please make sure that your travel is
one
all right joan you got this goodbye
real earth human friends been a pleasure
bye johnson he walks backwards into the
closet
does it doesn't take long yeah oh i was
going to ask if he was going to take uh
eight blue three with him oh yeah
actually he asks eight blue three
yeah well it sounds like you're leaving
right
all right don't get killed i'll try not
to
and hopefully maybe we'll meet again
can you still do our taxes
i mean i mean yeah technically you could
if i could just like
send you the receipts yeah if you could
get me the information
yeah i mean you still have the deals set
up with
uh yeah with jackson elias's yeah
it's been a while since we've talked to
him
the accounting has gotten a lot worse
i don't want i don't spare me the
details the
second half reimbursements are not going
to be up to snuff
iii said please do not die
we will certainly endeavor to not all
right and he walks he picks up silvano
walks back and the door closes
yes their hands are moving in a
horizontal manner
oh wait wave back like that to them for
me
i do not wish my hand to fall off oh
okay i don't well
uh all right so yeah you are in the room
and uh
so you start the ritual and
uh who are are is more than one person
performing the ritual or is only one
person
do we have to i mean i'm assuming we
have to well i mean i mean
in most of the rituals you've been part
of you know
you can you can share the cost or one
person can take the whole cost
or if you have a lot of blood you can
use blood magic
nope i'll also i'll get out of
syringe
we can you we can use i could use a
boost for that now luckily
i was able to get some more pow before
we left
luckily
so i'm ready
all right so
who all so alexandra you're helping with
the chanting sure
i i loathe magic but i also feel like i
don't want
joan to expend herself entirely on it
all right and you all pour the
liquids on the floor
and hollister's not gonna do anything
he i thought he was providing blood
delta green oh okay you are you are
providing your blood okay
but i mean you don't really know how
blood magic works is the problem
like you know i mean you could just drop
blood and see what happens
but you know blood magic is not joan
you're you're book magic
yeah you're you're you're you're a
wizard you're
like siphon energy from other people but
they get to keep their blood
you know just cover your hands and it'll
yeah i believe the spell i know is blood
magic
i was always going to use blood to cast
it so
i mean not his but okay
do we put the blood into the circle then
i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't mix it i
would just do i would do uh
additional circles and and symbols
around it
or within it let's stick to the
directions i mean this is not
you know what i mean this isn't we're
not putting together i'm not playing
probably some blood circles out for you
i just am not going to cast a skeleton
that's all i got to say i'm not a
mechanic
i thought you had more i thought you had
some more delta in yeah but
i couldn't i can like look into the
brain interface that's what i did with
joseph
but all right i got this
and alex thank you for your help i got
this we're going to get
okay here we go yeah yes
07 97 nice that's
yeah so it's so critical yeah joan
and alexandra start chanting
um and
uh the the portals the
the cert like the the area inside the
circle
starts to like shimmer and fall
and all you see as you look down
no other people or anything down there
nobody to wave to all you see is a
wooden floor
i grab my stuff and drop through that's
what we're told to do right that's what
you were told to do
all right so hollister goes through
and disappears
okay there's no way i go in seconds
i'm gonna stay here and keep chanting
until we're done
okay i'll make sure i have all of my
things and then drop through
all right yeah you go through and
disappear
all right everybody else is gone all
right i'm jumping
all right you go through and disappear
uh
alexandra and joan you each lose eight
pow
and you are all
on the deck of the ugliest battleship
um you are on the newly repainted
uh uss texas
steaming towards gray dragon island
and as you come through there's a
sailor
who salutes and says we were told to
expect you sir
here we are hi we have a
we have quarters prepared for you oh
fantastic
awesome i am starving i am so hungry i
have not eaten that
weird pasta stuff and i need that word
wonderful
nope i should make a sanity roll for the
sailor
yes he's surprisingly okay
maybe the elder sign helps um
and so yeah you are they you are um
you're brought food and they've got
you set up
in a they've got you set up in
in a small state room that they've set
up for four people
um and um
the captain of the ship will come down
uh after you've you know settled in uh
actually he'll invite you up to his
chain for dinner you'll have dinner with
the captain
oh the full set of charles dixon's
works as like a gift
did you bring them all i brought the cop
with me
i assume that could that would
disassemble if it's a cot
um the cot folds up quite small yeah
it's a
it's a very nice and now you have
something worth literally thousands
and possibly millions of dollars you're
you're now you're carl stanford
and from the future
so yeah the captain the captain's
like uh
we're several days out from from the
island
uh we're making good speed what should
we expect there
uh deep ones will probably come from the
ocean
sooner rather than later climb up on the
deck during night and try to kill
everyone
well no idea what to expect from the
spiders with stanford's face
especially now that he's dead are we
also going to get another water tsunami
or now
also also i am much i am very concerned
about lady jezebel
yeah what's what's she capable of and
where is she
yeah i understood about a third of that
most of it was prepositions you're
you're doing better than most actually
so things are going to come from the
water and try and kill us
the other side might protect against the
elder signs might help protect against
some of that stuff that we have here
the elder sign is the ridiculous
glow-in-the-dark paint job right
yes that that is something to help keep
us safe
from the creatures and other things that
we will find
hopefully is there any reason not to
just start bombarding this island as
soon as we get there
um how far away can we bombard it from
oh crud our guns are good
from about a mile oh depending on the
wind
if we hit it from just a mile and it
detonates uh
the explosion of their bomb will go out
20 miles
so we're going to need to get onto the
island and try to disarm it
or everyone in a 20 mile radius is going
to die
hey joan did you save some of that
portal liquid
we got the we got that we had to pour it
all out but there's little bottles with
little bits inside but that's it
are you in communication with rogers yes
sir
and they're actually the plans for the
bombs
or the yeah the bombs yes we
well i i'm i'm i'm aware of the weapon i
do not know the specifications of the
weapon
we're actually going to be picking up a
specialist uh
uh in china huh
uh someone from delta green as i
understand i don't know the name
okay where
in china are we stopping or is our luck
just bad enough that i should assume
shanghai
uh no shanghai's in very bad shape right
now we're
we're gonna be we're gonna be south
of there okay
we're actually gonna be closer um
we're gonna be closer to burma and then
up
we i have been i've been ordered
to i've been ordered to
essentially get all follow your lead
so i'm con i am looking to you to be my
advisors
in this all right
because i don't have one goddamn idea
what's going on here
i don't know why they painted my boat
like my ship like this i called it a
boat oh gosh
you're about to get navy people down
your ass man
i don't know why they painted it like
this i don't know to protect against
i mean you understand we teleported onto
your deck
i am spending every amount of effort i
can to ignore that fact
my men only sort of know what they're
going in for but
they're good boys the texas will do you
proud
now i was also told that there's a
chance that there will be other nations
naval activity present
the japanese how long have we been gone
for what's today
it is now july first oh wow
oh we've been gone a while how long it
a's on days on pluto are a lot faster
i believe that is the case but i don't
it's true you you never actually saw a
day
no yeah one day on pluto is six earth
days
so
relativistic time it's fun
uh so yeah you are on board the texas
which is
steaming towards great dragon island
uh how many how many days is it to the
full moon let's see
uh joan you've got the cool calendar yes
um the
full moon it's july the 6th
yes yeah it's on the sixth if you know
if we can just nuke the island
set it on delay leave be 20 miles out
i don't think the phase of the moon will
matter
well no but we still need to seal the
place and if we're stopping off in china
i mean maybe we'd do a a quick run into
shanghai and try to nick the
the thing yeah but we have to emma
we have until january right yes
resources into getting another jade we
have 197
days left before the end of the world
before jezebel takes the stupid island
back
well and there's that if we if if we can
lock it down sooner rather than later
yes after we blow the place to hell
i i don't know i mean i'm sure she could
undo it but
if she oh god i wonder if she has well
then
does the island even matter should we be
more concerned with finding her
collecting any intelligence we can on
that and where would we start
you know her the best i don't not in
this reality
london i don't know if this is reality
another town i can't go back to look no
that was a
that was taken care of i mean it kind of
can't go back
you literally can the version of her
that that i knew was in the world that
emma and i came from before it got
destroyed
i don't know how different or similar
she is or if it's the same one
somehow if somehow she survived
the destruction of that universe and you
met up with her yeah you did meet her in
this
timeline you saw her in this timeline
and i'm trying to remember because it's
been a while you get your cards and she
talked about um
she recognized us yes she recognized you
and she talked about ending the world
yeah but that was just jezebel i just i
just kind of assume that that's what she
wow okay
um well then
okay so i mean we saw belle's in london
and she read cards and
remembered us did she indicate that she
was the same one from the previous
universe she did not
okay so i don't know if it's the same
one from that universe and if she knows
what she would have known from there or
so she did although
just you know in her in her little
monologue she did mention that she's not
a constant
or she alluded to the fact that she's
not a constant okay
she said in her monologue that she was
going to make herself the constantist of
yep
all right i think that is where we're
going to end it
freeze we haven't we have at least one
