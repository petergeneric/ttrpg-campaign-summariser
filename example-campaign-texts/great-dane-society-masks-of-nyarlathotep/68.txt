last time
we took a a side trip to pluto uh
yagath as no whatever as you do
uh and we we we got to see our old
pal silvano
uh or pieces of him a piece of him to
him yeah
and he can he can now literally
give you a piece of his mind
uh and you learned
a few things you you know you you you
made a deal
with the the with the migo the fungi
from yoguth
uh to to help out
in this in your battle at gray dragon
island um
and you you ended up
um you ended up finding a way
back to earth and you ended up on the
battleship texas
uh and the tech the the the texas has
been
uh festooned with elder signs it's
been
painted with protective signals all over
it as the
the us military tries to guard against
enemies foreign domestic and interplaner
uh and you you were
you were about four days out from
uh picking up you were gonna pick up
um some assistance
on the mainland and then you were gonna
head to grey dragon island
and so you everybody's healed if
you took any damage
uh the the ship takes care of you the
the medical people
uh take care of you and that sort of
thing sadly they do not have a therapist
on that's why we have hollister
that's right sure because neither do we
that dice out do you want me to yeah yes
aren't they all the same dice yes no
no no okay i i will i will say this
i will whinge about it all day long but
i at my lowest point of sanity i was at
about 20.
i am going into the finale with 52. whoa
am i rolling does anybody well i mean
you certainly have time if anybody wants
a session with the
with hollister i can't give me luck back
i'll take it i'll take a session if no
one else you know that reminds me of
something
um is hollister is your
uh to be a little vague here and
reference some messages that nick sent
me
um are you still
concerned about that thing that you told
professor lamb
yeah i'm still not uh
sharing that for the damage that it
might do okay
all right well i'm sure it won't come up
later
uh so yeah go ahead uh
uh dr hollister make a psychotherapy
oh wow i made it on the nose all right
uh you get to sanity back alexandria
uh anybody else gonna do a a session
with the good doctor
yes all right professor lam
all right he's got he's got some things
to tell you yeah yeah
yeah i just rolled the nick
the same thing you also got a 73 you
just barely made it
all right that is two points of sanity
for you as well sweet
uh yeah you're you're feeling you're
feeling pretty good um
so about four days
into the journey uh
there is a sound that you have come
to recognize as a call to general
quarters
which is sort of the the first step of
emergency preparedness
you are in a you're in one of the
officers
state rooms that was that was set
up
for four diff for four officers and
so you are in one state room
and it is
it is below decks but you've started to
um you've started to get a sense of the
ship
so you you've
you've heard this a few times it usually
has to do
with if there's another ship
approaching
do we do we actually typically go to our
uh
there's a lot of like you know yeah i
was wondering if
if this sort of thing like we went to
our room or if we peeked up on deck and
people were like you need to go down or
something
so you usually you pick up on deck and
nobody cares
you figure if it were actually dangerous
they might say something
yeah well let's go let's go peek we
would probably
actually go to the
the command room right you could yeah
and this is what july 5th at this point
yes
you are you are underway making best
possible speed
towards the asian mainland to uh
to rendezvous and then you will make
best possible speed to grey dragon
island
which by the way uh
this map which you can barely see that
little circle area there
is gray dragon island this okay uh
this is china
shanghai is i do not speak of shanghai
is right
here okay and so
you're coming in this you're coming
in this way around the corner of japan
giving japan a fairly wide berth and you
are going to you're supposedly going to
head to a small area
south of shanghai and then head to grey
dragon island
so you yeah sure you head to the command
area
and it seems like this is
a little more a little more vigilant
than it has been in the past
and as you come up the the captain
who did i name him last time i hope i
did uh
captain texas of the texas captain dave
first name mcgillicuddy first name is
theodore
ooh there you go i think that
where this ship you want to teddy dave
i don't want a gimmick in fringe so
um
uh captain there's a a
uh an ensign with a set of binoculars
looking off to the left of the ship and
you as you come on the bridge
you hear him say outline consistent
oh she's not under steam
and the
the ship is trying to reach it's you
know it's trying to radio this
uh naval doctrine stands
uh holds that you know the ship you
don't want another ship getting within a
certain space of you
uh and so they keep um
they keep saying like you know japanese
destroy
unidentified ship approaching from
whatever please
uh please pull two and identify
yourself and they're not getting any
response
are they preparing the fire on it if
it gets close
they it does not they're they're not
looking to fire on it but they are
definitely watching it and it is
definitely like
um making space with them
what's making space mean it's it's it is
it is like it is moving towards you
and the ensign again says it's not
under steam sir
yeah is it wow maybe it's not it's being
powered
uh unnaturally is that what do we think
it has a reactor
i mean it may not have any power
if it's moving towards us it
so the navy is all the people on the
bridge are ignoring you
could they have something pulling it
i think out here don't they usually have
the little tug boats and
ports i was thinking of something
maybe
but things would have moved awfully fast
with the japanese if they're
dealing in those areas true it's only
well they're not yeah if they're not
paying attention then we'll just watch
this unfold
i don't know if taro got back to them
with
things like so yeah alexandra when
you
when you say it's only been a couple
days like as of
june as of june 24th the japanese were
like we're going tomorrow we want to
talk with you and then you disappeared
it was a june 26th the last time that we
talked to them but yeah
i mean so it's been several days
it's been a little well about a week and
a half i guess oh goodness
yeah we were and taro could have been
mind controlled or who knows what
mind controlled or maybe he found what
the japanese were looking for
i mean he was very interested in that
weapon
i know from what i recall he was very
interested in the deal
and that came with that came with the
power sources
but stanford's dead so maybe he just but
stanford was a puppet
that would be a reason why they wouldn't
have to have power for their ship
and are bearing down directly on us
especially since we're heading toward
the island yeah that place
well if they're not getting ready to
fight we can watch this destroyer sink
we know where the lifeboats are you're
on a battleship
battleship whatever we go down with the
ship
the captain does we don't uh
i i know where the lifeboats are i
located them our first day yeah
do they have more than life boats i
would assume they'd actually have
smaller
boats with you know motorized that we
could yeah either skiffs
yeah that sort of thing and and
and you also have been given slightly
more than cursory
uh training in getting all you know
in
emergency evacuations yep
okay well looks like we might be there
so are you doing anything as the ship
as this ship approaches
i mean how how far is it to one of the
skiffs
uh you can you can get there they're on
the side of the ship so you could pretty
easily go
run and we can wait to see how it plays
out i mean if they're not responding and
they're coming in
they're hostile and if the if the
captain's not doing anything
then they're dead so
i'm even i'm saying this in the room to
everyone else in front of him
right though um
captain dave captain dave like hears
this and he snaps around and
you know clearly he's not used to people
questioning anything he does
and he says those are not our rules of
engagement
that's a that's a japanese destroyer if
ready your weapons for when they start
firing on you well i'm fine
i'm getting i'm leaving and i'm heading
towards this yeah yeah if it rams you
then that's an active war isn't it
uh depends on if it's an accident or not
all right
is there any way we can wheel around
uh well they're more maneuverable than
we are but true
i mean if they get too much if my rules
of engagement do have
uh if they if it looks like they're
going to ram us there
are we have options great okay
i'm just getting if ready that's all yep
nope i'm gonna follow up
all right are you two alexander and
i'm going to linger for a bit on the
bridge because i want to see
if the japanese captain responds
and there is no response and the guy the
the
um the guy who's on the on the bridge uh
says that the ship is sort of
maintaining a constant distance
just far enough where all he can see is
he's not even sure he's like it's a
silhouette that he recognizes
as you know his job is recognizing ship
silhouettes
right so he recognizes that it's a an
imperial japanese
uh destroyer but he doesn't know
anything about
anything else it's not closing on us or
anything huh yeah that's what i was
under the impression that it was doing
specifically if it was pacing us then i
was told no it's it it got
it got it got to a certain distance and
now it is pacing you
ah okay
well
are they going to help are they going to
i'm i'm going to stay on the bridge and
keep watch over over what's going on and
listen to what's going on
and if things go absolutely sideways i
know i can scramble
and get to this gift pretty quickly all
right
uh yeah they are they're very concerned
about being shadowed
yeah that is not great in naval combat
uh and um
but they you know at a certain point
they decide well we've got our uh
we've got our mission so we gotta do it
they're gonna they you know they
they go back they had slowed down a
little bit when they weren't sure what
was going on
so they speed back up now they're at now
as high enough speed that
probably you cannot really or well let
me rephrase that
releasing a skiff would be a little more
exciting at speed
yeah yeah we can't do that oh i'm more
i'm more getting it ready like
potentially getting supplies and putting
it on it if something happens
all right going down like a checklist
and like this is working that's working
okay it's still full yeah the skiff is
working great
okay i'll i'll i'll be helping you the
doctor
taking any of our supplies on it
just in case yeah let's let's do it all
right you start to
move all of your equipment onto them as
if it goes down so do the grenades
um all right they remain at general
quarters
uh so they're like at the the
lowest state of readiness uh
as long as that ship is with is is
shadowing them
well i'm gonna have a side talk with
hollister while we're doing we're doing
this kind of stuff because we've talked
about
the time magic and the research that
i've been doing and
um i'm gonna tell him it's like maybe i
can slow the boat or i can turn the boat
away or
if it gets down to it oh not not at this
distance right
no but if we get if it gets down if it
gets closer and down to it we might be
able to do something
do you think some of them envelop an
no i was thinking of their i was
thinking of their motors
or something like that or maybe
yeah maybe it's not going to work but
i'm just trying to figure out there's
i don't know have you played around with
it all do you know what the range is
no because i i've been i've been worried
about
well i i as far as i can throw i've
thrown a rock
and see if i could get it to stay in the
well maybe we want to set up some tests
i mean there's a there's a good amount
of room on this
ship we'd have to play dude some
place where people can't really watch
that's going to be hard in general
quarters that's going to be hard on a
navy ship
that's not very big so anyway it was
just a thought i thought i'd
uh we'd i'd bring it up
well if the coast is clear and we had
some rope we could hang something off
the side of the ship
and see if you could yeah so that might
be some more distance but
yeah yeah all right well thanks i think
uh i'll just
all right so
uh things you're gonna are gonna get a
little more anxious at night because
that ship is not running any running
lights
and so and
let's check the moon on yes it well it's
uh on the sixth it's full
so we should have well but in which
hemisphere
yet oh that's true which hemisphere
we take a gift out with a drill and we
sneak up alongside it
put a little hole here over there
i six the 1925 phase of the moon
china
fine we'll bring gasoline and set it on
fire emma yeah i was just saying that's
easy
yeah is this for china no this is should
we just sleep in the skip
i was thinking about it but
i think we'd have enough some time yeah
skiff is
skip his backup ship right now yeah i
think we have some time
if things come we could get over there
it's not too far from where we are at
right
i mean relatively speaking sure we can
scramble there
yeah um
my google foo is weak so i don't know
what the uh
i don't think the hemisphere matters i
think it's wherever you are the moon is
full
which yeah yeah kind of interesting to
it's kind of like time zones hadn't
really thought about it until now um
cue that insane clown posse magnet
song
i just really want to see you run a one
shot about the day of two noons
um so yeah it is it is a full moon so
um that helps with visibility uh
but the ship not running with no running
lights it's still
very hard to find and it keeps
slipping in and out of their vision
[Music]
uh about so are you guys you're going
to sleep in the skiff
no it's going to be cold in there no we
decided cold in there we decided that we
could run there if we needed to
all right so um
are you just you figure that if they
if they go on alert there will be an
alarm that will wake you up yeah
yeah or explosions or yeah
yeah the next morning there's a knock
on your door and there's an ensign there
uh and the instant says the captain
would like to see you
all right and you know there's
you're in the captain's study
there's there's coffee
and um
the captain says that over overnight
uh overnight the ship got
a lot closer and it's apparently
derelict
it was not running running lights
there's
there are no there are no markings it's
not flying the japanese flag
doesn't have the does it have a name
painted on the side
it does yeah and it's it's one of theirs
what's the name uh
i don't know he gives you a name of a
japanese destroyer and
a a historically appropriate name of a
japanese destroyer in 1925.
my my big question is is it the same one
that we were on that was taken to pieces
no it is not that one i actually got the
name of it was like the okay good good
good
okay that's good to what is the naval
procedure if you come across
well i'm i'm in i'm inclined to
investigate
and then let the japanese know but we
can't really let them know until we're
in port
or you know we don't have that kind of
also there's our timetable in our
primary mission
well of course of course but if you know
if there's any
if there's anyone on that ship in
can do would you like us to
accompany some of your men over there to
that would be great yeah i'd love um
it's clear
from my orders that you people
know things that i don't know
and so yeah i think i'd if you don't
mind i'll send you with
uh a squad of marines sounds good
certainly all right so um
they you hear them like the ship starts
to slow
uh to um
the ship starts to slow to to drop
the skiff
and the marines are getting in why is
there all this stuff in here
[Laughter]
we have our our own things that we need
that is a lot of alcohol
that's terrible
[Laughter]
so you um
you know the skiff starts to head over
and you are approaching this
ghost ship it is completely silent
um and uh
you know none of you are sailors but um
the
sailors on board are trying to figure
out how a derelict kept speed with a
battleship
and yeah that's my question uh
and so there are uh
eight marines and uh
three sailors that are manning a skiff
uh
and they they have like a hook
ladder that they hook on the the railing
and everybody climb
yeah well well before we go climbing up
i just want to look at them and go
just as an fyi if you see something
green and glowing
stay well away away from it i don't know
if there's something like that here
but stay well away from well away from
it if it is
alexandria does not mind being mistaken
for a dude for the record she made a
living on that
um and uh
they so the marines go up first and they
start to spread out
and look around things and you guys
are up on the deck it's
um the climb up is not that bad
uh the sea is not that bad but if the
seas were bad that would not have been
fun
well should we should go up on
let's go up and see what we can see it
seems like most of the marines are going
below decks first
do we want to go check the the
command station first that's
what i was thinking yes all right so the
leader of the marines the sergeant
who's leading the marines and one other
marine are heading up towards the bridge
okay and uh
as you come along they they you reach
the bridge
the bridge is completely empty on the
um on the
uh there's in the map room which is
sort of behind the bridge is a map of
a route to
okay are there any controls here
yeah the bridge is it's a normal bridge
yeah yeah can we try stopping it
um do you know how to operate a vessel
there's like it's and on the skiff i
mean it's just
further problem it's all in japanese
yeah
so but it is under power we are moving
you are moving but it does you don't
feel the engines
that's what i was worried about i was
worried about something which is why i
warned them about something green and
glowing
yeah yeah they'll figure out the deep
ones on their own
i was not going to tell them about fish
people
uh so the bridge is eerily silent
there is no one here there's no signs of
a struggle
there's no can we i mean just just
looking at it can i tell if there's
levers that are
on or off it looks like
everything is most things
have been there are some lights and
things that are on
on indicators okay it seems like
there's normal power to all of the
systems
all right are there any notes and things
on the table i might want to pick up
notes about what they were doing or
anything like that there's the map
in the map room yeah in the yeah
there's a there are some notes around
they're all of course in japanese
but i i will we'll get somebody to
translate maybe but
i'd like to get those okay yeah yeah you
scoop up some notes
um the notes have a fairly detailed map
of gray dragon island perfect perfect
three
you know pre-bond villain volcano base
right
where are we in comparison to where so
did they
if i mean you don't know if they've
gotten there or not i mean you're a good
way
so like you know what i mean i'm just
trying to figure out how they got there
and they're now coming for us or are
they headed there
so again you're like over here
yeah that's what i'm saying it's like
how they got there
and then are coming to towards us or are
we well so they went from here
to here and then somehow this came out
here
yeah but we think that they have been to
great dragon island and are coming from
it
that's what i'm surmising i think i mean
that is that is certainly one way that
this could be interpreted
okay or they're taking a very
roundabout route
to get the great dragon island or you
know keeping watch out for american
ships coming toward there
right i want to look around and see
if there's any
um flashlights and i imagine they would
be like the big
car battery type things but i want to
say i don't want to go below decks
without light
there's yeah there's no problem you hear
um you hear every once in a while
marines like down below
like yelling out things and that sort of
thing no
but just really they're they're they
they clearly have a system wherein they
check in
every x minutes good am i able to find
more than one flashlight
sure yeah you can find a couple all
right who wants these i want my hands
free
just in case i'm still i'm so i'm
assuming
i don't want to flip anything that's a
toggle but if there's anything that's a
lever that could be that looks like a
throttle you think you see something
that's a throttle
and it seems like it's it's in the
middle
which you know you've been up on the
hmm
i mean i'm just trying things out to see
if the ship responds to the instruments
in the command room so are you moving
the throttle at all
yeah okay um
as you put the throttle are you putting
it forward or backwards
i'll start so i'm gonna be moving slowly
but i'll start with forward
okay so yes the ship
hums to life with it's it's a very
different noise
than than the ship you're on
which is a deep rumbling this is kind of
and as soon as you do that the two
marines like both flip around
and they see you there and they go
we need to know how this is working and
we need to know what this does if we're
going to stop it
that's the throttle sir to stop it you
just put it back in the middle
okay but then we would stop right and
okay no like this is i'm letting him
just talk and and do we want to go
sure i'm gonna start moving it down
all right so the ship is not moving
but there's definite that hum
noise the further you go in either
and is our the ship isn't changing its
movement at all
the ship is not changing its movement at
all
now you have not got to full throttle in
either direction
but we've we've felt no change by no
you've gone
you know you went to you're you're at
about half throttle now and there's
um the hum has gotten louder but the
ship has not moved
so doctor i don't know
much about votes but like isn't there
supposed to be somebody downstairs
that this corresponds to who actually
does the control that's not what it i
mean
i don't know all i know is that i'm
adjusting it now and there's clearly
something happening
from this it's not i'm no duchess
but i've been on a couple boats a lot of
boats
well speaking of of the duchess though
does this remind me
of anything that i would have heard on
on the black duchess
all right i'm the same as the one right
um the black wind i thought it was the
black duchess or something yeah
probably as a slip it was but yeah
um the
um yeah it does sound somewhat similar
i'll i'll pass it along to the others i
so i run downstairs all right i'm gonna
it's actually lit below decks okay
and
you see the marines are moving very
slowly
and very cautiously and i'm like clan
yeah and
you just you come running up and like
you run
past two of them as they're like you
know very carefully they're doing like
the two-man clear every room
yeah thing yeah yeah i'm i'm sticking
with emma because if she's running into
danger she's not going alone
uh all right so you guys start you're
just
keep going down until you can't go down
anymore um
do i run into because i'm looking for
i'm actually looking for the the
person in charge of all this there's no
one on this ship yet that you found no
i'm talking about the person in charge
of the boarding crew what's his name oh
he's up on the bridge
the the the marine sergeant up on the
bridge
okay um
you can talk to him before you leave if
you want yeah i just want to know like
where the the captain's cabin would
be
uh usually all the officers are in
the
um are in the bridge deck so it would be
right around here
okay i'm like that means nothing to me
um
we can we can hastings
uh take this woman and check out the
um so yeah he'll he'll take you around
and
there are various officers and you find
um you find what is clearly
the the captain's quarters um
and you open it and hastings
hastings screams my smack i'm gonna
be like pull yourself together man
well let's find out make a sanity roll
i'm also
with because i'm not letting emma run
sanity is fine my sanity is not this
good
too all right so emma you're gonna
lose two sanity
as lying in
the lying in the bed
in the captain's thing in his cabin
is the desiccated body of a japanese
uh imperial naval officer um
that to your eye to your now expert eye
there is not a drop of blood in this
body
and hastings is not a fan of this he's
like backing away
uh let's make a con roll for hastings oh
hastings roll as a 97.
you know what's really fun vomiting on a
navy ship oh
there's not a lot of room he's in the
hallway just like
point that direction yeah really really
uh i'm
i'm going to enter the room cautiously
just like looking
throughout to make sure there isn't i
don't
know we haven't run into vampires yet
but sure why not
uh what do you got is while she's doing
that yeah while
she's doing that i'm gonna tell
alexandria i'll be like
so did bells get in here before
breakfast
maybe i i got baby carrots i failed that
all right yeah everything's fine i was
waiting for that sentence
is there any sigils on the doorway
that's what i'm looking for
you don't see any stitches in the
doorway but now that you look for it you
see
in the bunk of the captain it looks like
as he oh no lost all his blood
no does it look like he
does it does it remind me of what's
her name
oh god i cannot think no it's not like
agatha he's not still writing
this is something that he wrote as he
um and the weird part is it's in english
oh no what do i edge closer to look i
have a dagger in my hand because
that's how i handle situations i
oh that's an old d and d joke uh
so it says you've brought me so
i knew it owls
you know there was a time once upon a
anyway another universe long time ago
universe far far away i'm not convinced
this isn't the same one
interesting
i mean i don't have anything to go on
with that but
a hunch at this point everybody on
the
ship you got you two
uh lamb and hollister on the bridge
you heard this
the scream and then the vomiting and now
you hear
um you hear yells
from below decks of the marines
um as they are uh
essentially they're relaying a message
um and when it comes up to the bridge
you hear
an officer like he bus in sir we have a
survivor
don't trust it
where and like
the the very military guy looks at his
commanding officer and looks at the guy
who just asked him a question
uh below deck sir down in the engine
room
we should at least talk to it and and
the well well
so the sergeant
sergeant sergeant bellevue yes uh
sergeant bellevue just immediately says
well
get them above decks hurry man
and the guy go the guy starts reeling
we have to talk to him no matter what
uh as you so i guess you two head
back into the bridge so the four of you
are together
are you gonna like start heading down
following the relay of the voices or
wait till they bring it up i'm not going
down there all right
and and we pass along that it's
they they don't know who that that is
yes
we we've referenced lady jezebel a
couple of times it's it's it's the woman
whose voice we heard
as as it opened the one who wanted to
make fountains of blood throughout the
world and rule it
oh yeah the sergeant the sergeant just
looks at you with a blank stare
and i just look back at him with a
completely bland expression
that's above my pay grade man are we
that this is a trap
i'm pretty sure this is a trap because
that note was written in english
there's no reason why a japanese captain
would write in
english and referencing us well it may
just be it may not be a trap it may be a
warning warning sign i don't know if we
have anything
specific right this second to be afraid
of but
yes we should be afraid to make sense
it occurs to me we got into this we
totally forgot to do the first giveaway
because we're gonna do so right now
giveaway
hashtag chaos i just dove right
right into telling the story hashtag
chaos for
a set of birds of paradise dice because
we have to do another one at the break i
realized yeah
yeah yeah yeah so this is the pre-break
giveaway we're gonna do a pre-break
giveaway
a break giveaway and a post-break
giveaway
a set of birds of paradise dice of your
choice based on the ones we have in the
studio
we might even have ones that aren't
[Applause]
and say what they are they have the
names on them i where are the names
should be written down there in marker
oh my god this isn't english
it looks like solomon's thunderstorm
sonoran yes those are the ones i have
they're lovely
my cabbage how about that what's that
cabbages
what does this say oh this is sonoran
sunset so we i have a bunch of snoring
sunsets something
all right you might be getting sonoran
sunset yeah uh
so i brought a whole heck of a lot of
them back with me in my backpack when i
visited arizona
there we go all right at this
point
uh the the the relay message gets
back up to the bridge
um and uh
the guy bus in sir apparently the
survivor
is chained in the engine room
we're we're working to free them or
somebody's working to free them
trap a trap
so you've now been on this ship about 45
minutes
we could tell them to just scuttle it
they're going to want to keep the
survivor they're not going to just
how many votes did we come in here on
how many you came in one skiff
yeah i know right
you could see if there are escape boats
on this ship
yes ah there you go that is the answer
to my
all right if we see an explosive i'm
just saying put it in your pocket
well and and and knowing whether or not
there are escape vessels tells us
whether or not people got out of here
there so it seems like all of the escape
boats are still on this ship it it would
be to look
interesting to go see their stores to
see if they are any weapons and things
that we could take before we scuttle
this
looks up at that what do you think we
are not scuttling this vessel
ma'am this is a japanese military vessel
that would be an act of war
this is a trap and and where
this is an international incident this
is a trap
for for an international problem and
where we're the mice
nibbling on the cheese it's about to
that's a little over dramatic man okay
how about yeah all
zombies on grey dragon island waiting to
kill you
drama enough for you no there's no more
zombies they're replaced with the
fishman
oh yeah that's right okay guys guys guys
let's
let's focus a little bit here okay
because okay if it is a trap
we need to get off it anyway but let's
get what we can off this boat before
we either go or not they won't be able
to tell
under no circumstances will you pillage
a vessel of the japanese navy i agree
let's just go all right
all right all right i'm used to being
able to uh
rescue items so that's where i uh
it's where i focus that word may mean
something different to you ma'am that it
does
anywhere else none of this belongs to us
and it's important that you remember
that
i don't want to start a war with the
goddamn japanese
rice
all right then let's go and let's just
go let's just get out of here
are you guys just getting on one of the
escape boats
going back this is incredibly foolish
the
the whole thing is obviously a trap i
mean
yes it's obviously a trap but if we
leave we're leaving all of those marines
and those sailors behind
to be snapped up and used
as fuel you're right
all right focused on following their
orders
well there comes a point
where i think even the strongest
military person will understand that
and if we are here to tell them run this
direction
because we know because we have the
information all right
and they may not take that information
from us they may not listen to us fine
whatever
we've been ignored and doubted before we
can just tell them to run when
yeah all right let's see what happens
all right almost as you say that the
door bursts open again
and the runner sir they freed the
survivor they're bringing her they're
bringing them on deck
her or him uh
i don't know i haven't seen them all
right let's go
let's go go see let's let's go let's go
under the deck
all right so you guys head down yep um
ah look who's here of course she is
it's a sequel ongoing vessel and
because she might actually think we're
we're we're good this time so
if she if she remembers us and
up taking up the entire narrow stairway
up from the lower deck apparently being
pushed by several marines
um is uh
is the small constellation that you know
as the duchess
[Laughter]
so is she coming up to the the map room
and stuff
you're there oh i'm faint
help me and she like gestures
vaguely at all of you i am nowhere near
strong enough to support her bulk
um all right either
is she she's just on deck yes
we are up farther in the no you're
down you came down on deck so
okay so we're on deck we're down and
she's coming up yeah so she's out the
stairway
yeah she's like listing over to the side
of the boat
um and she she's just oh do we have a
place for her to sit
i'll i'll find a chair or something
thank you push it over in that direction
exactly yeah you know what there are a
lot of on navy ships deck chairs
yeah i know that's why i was that's why
i was wondering if she was going up we
could go buy
something right or something to shove
behind her legs there you go
um sure yeah you find a you find a crate
but she like collapses you see the crate
like bend a little
yeah yep yep so that's when you notice
i will never take that cruise line
again
ah well glad you're trying to save
500 pounds and this is what happens
glad glad to see you ma'am uh
i'm glad you are you
right no oh yes we're on a ship i'd
remember you
if you were anyone important oh believe
me
we are important to you right now ma'am
do you realize that you were on a
japanese ship that's why those horrible
men refused to speak english
exactly exactly and now we do have some
gentlemen food
they don't cook their fish it's
uncivilized
exactly exactly and are you here alone
or were you here with
uh say it
friends
i think you mean tidwell no i'm gonna i
was yeah
were you is is tidwell anywhere around
that awful little man he left me in
china
and i'm just trying to get home and
tidwell hasn't
been with you since check
the shadows yeah i watch the shadows
there is no sign of tidwell oh my
goodness
those two together would be you know the
gorilla
yes i do indeed we've met before how do
you know the gorilla
well we might have shared a few
i see how deep her devotion goes yeah
let's let's not kiss and tell lady
had a certain magnetism
yes some of us knew that
um so
what happened to make you be chained up
down at the bottom of this boat what
happened
i woke up here i was making a deal
in shanghai to be taken back to america
you know i make my home in america now
because it's so much more civilized than
england
hmm yeah no i know about you know
about
the us so yeah civilized okay
but the point is so you you don't
remember anything you don't know how you
got here
i was discussing with the the gorilla
yeah and she was going to set up my my
travel
she said she knew a very very high class
cruise line
i see when i woke up here
i've been down there for a week and
at some point the the awful little men
who run this cruise ship
and you didn't hear any anything else
that happened
because there's nobody here except us
chicken no the service is terrible
three days i've been down there three
days okay
three days i'm famished
well should we bring her back to the
ship
[Music]
yes how much do you hate the captain
do you have a better boot or can any of
you sail this boat
we can't this is it belongs to the
cruise line it belongs to
uh is going to come and get it so we
need to um
well i should have a harshly worded
letter to the owner of that company
you can make no mistake i look forward
to seeing it
yes but for now since we are an
international waters
um our friends at the uh
are we going back to america well we
have a couple stops to make on the way
i am not feeling generous toward toward
our naval friends
so should we have them take her back
first and then we
[Laughter]
yes go ahead spring her on the captain
that'll be fun
uh the yeah the marines are looking
aghast at this whole thing and they're
very confused why
uh a woman in an in a in a like emerald
nightgown
was tied up to the engine of this thing
well has has all sense of chivalry
disappeared from the united states
military
help help this poor lady uh
yes ma'am and
they're gonna get her up move her away
from us so we can chat
there well they can move away from that
how to get her down a rope ladder
yeah let's have that let's move away
let's move away and check down and then
back
up that's gonna be fun well they well
they will figure out logistics
and let's move away
why would madame lynn send her out to
here
does she need to be on the island
maybe
i don't know she she turns up everywhere
and that is entirely too coincidental to
be coincidence and i
am exactly so maybe she has to be there
we keep hearing about bloated woman and
things that's not her right
i thought the same thing but emma and i
did see the bloated woman
leaving from hofang's estate through
the
i wonder she doesn't need a boat
like that that's the name of our last
range we don't need a boat
yeah but no but so okay so
maybe she can be helpful maybe there's
something she can do
oh she certainly has that in spades i
wonder though if there was any message
left with her i was a little afraid to
ask if she had anything in her pockets
um well maybe we can persuade her to
change
outfits once we move her over somehow
if you if you can find something on a
u.s naval ship that will fit her
mm-hmm the crew member part of this is a
young
bob
that mackie be so awesome and he takes
it he takes
some some canvas and some other things
and here you go
all right guys
so the the skiff somehow they've gotten
her down it probably involved a crane
the skiff takes off with several of
the soldiers
um captain bel sergeant bellevue
is down and he says you know that woman
unfortunately you've encountered her
why was she tied up in the engine room
good question
no that's what we're trying to find out
was there everybody like
me make me a listen role
yes
can i get a hundred and nine how do i
get a 10 and a nine
how does that work oh it's that set of
uh birds
it's a 19 19. okay so yeah okay i gotta
i got a hard success on my list and i
got it i also got a hard success
all right anybody who made the role the
oh was she the power source i was just
wondering that
yeah are we slowing down as well
the boat is now like yeah the um
when you like when you ask if we're
slowing down the
um the sergeant like the sergeant
notices that you're like drifting now
is there a way to drop an anchor on this
uh probably and uh
he'll i'm hoping it's the same as on our
ships
i i assume we don't want it to drift too
far so the japanese can find their ship
i i don't know if this is true in the
1920s but like the navy
is very specialized like you know how to
do your job
yeah yeah and so the sergeant is like
um he he has a couple guys go and see
if they can figure out how to drop the
anchor
um before before you leave sergeant
a quick question for you of course ma'am
was there any sort of a
message anywhere around that or anywhere
around that woman down there
uh the men who brought her up didn't say
anything about that
i was not down there all right
thank you could could we take a look
where she was would that be okay can we
go
down there real quick and take a look
there of course
yeah i i'm you know my orders are to
allow you to investigate
however you wish i hope that i don't
need to check your pockets when you come
back
he says looking at joan yes and i said
i'll promise you
i will not pick up anything that i
shouldn't
all right yeah i'm going to stay here
on deck
um most of the men went back on the
skiff with the
survivor so it's just the two of us
and what was the name of the guy who
threw up hastings i think it was
uh and hastings all right hastings is
up on the bridge
okay they'll all remain here but
um probably don't leave him alone
and don't assume that we're the only
ones left on here
well i'm going to go down and take a
look at where she was um
who's coming with me my concern is that
if i go up to the bridge there will be
no
message relay i
am not sure how good the message relay
will be regardless but
we'll try all right and he'll he'll head
back you notice like
he like he like moves quickly to get
back up to the bridge
yeah right all right so i mean i i know
that there are lights down there but we
also have flashlights
yes well are there still lights there
are oh
uh who are there
yes although they seem dim so you're
glad you have the flashlights
all right flashlights and i can it's
like a crowbar right
how was she a power source how did that
happen well that's what we're gonna go
sheer spite and imperial will imperial
will yes but let's go see if there's
anything else down there that we can see
that they haven't scuffed up all right
um so you find the engine room
um and you see that it looks like the
duchess
was chained in the middle of the room
inside some sort of chalk drawn figure
that looks like a chinese character and
that's but yeah i was going to see if we
look like a chinese character that we've
seen before
it looks like the sign of the bloated
woman
well yeah take notes take a sample of
the chalk
i always have a notebook with me because
this is what i do sure yeah you you mark
down the symbol
and is there anything special about the
chains are they like some sort of
conduit or anything
no they i mean they seem like normal
chains
um and while you're in the engine room
uh everybody make me
yep that is a hard success for me
okay it's regular 22.
pity this isn't delta green that'd
be a critical success with a hard
success
um you see so there's no
like glowing green anything in this this
is a normal engine room
um and you
uh you see um
uh a huge
some working of the engine that you know
what you don't understand
is um
[Music]
the body of tidwell
and his throat has been slit
but it's been slit in such a way that
he's very
his blood was like dripping out very
slowly and his blood was going into some
sort of stone bowl on the floor
um but the stone bowl is still there
yes i'm gonna reach down and just like
touch it with my fingertips
not picking it up just yet but like
touching it very gently
all right yeah it seems like it seems
joan have you seen anything
uh fair warning there's a there's a dead
man over here but have you seen anything
um like this in your um
your expeditions there all right i look
at them
uh i mean this seems like
some sort of blood magicky thing yeah
but does the bowl look like anything i
mean you can make a cthulhu mithos roll
sure i'm that's where i'm at right now
now you know
sometimes ebola it's as the great
sigmund freud once said sometimes the
bowl of blood is just a bowl of
blood is are there any sigils or
anything on it or is it just
a reference no it's entirely unadorned
is it
i wonder if i could reuse it no and in
fact
um you can all make
a a medicine roll
we'll call it i don't know why um
i'm not even going to bother my mom's
one 55.
i don't have anything all right
hollister you look at the bowl
and a there's no way
that given the position with that he was
in there's no way that blood should have
been pumping out of him
the whole time if you know he would
have died before that happened and b
um there was more there should have been
a lot more blood
overflowing from this bowl
shoot i would know that i've i know how
you usually don't stick around for all
the blood to come out
depends on where i slash but sure fair
point
yeah i probably shouldn't take it
because i was gonna say the opposite
i was thinking that she might be able to
to to
if it's hers she might be able to feel
it i i think we should dump it in the
ocean
yeah i mean then we're just giving it to
i mean we are on a ship that has a giant
elder sign on it so
do we tell do we tell our
friends upstairs about our other friend
down here
um is there so the engines are down here
is there
a furnace that seems to be lit anywhere
yeah what what do you say about burning
fire i mean i don't want to bring the
blood with me
well and fire cleanses things if there's
a if there's a connection that might
destroy it
and do we want to put tidwell there too
depends on how big the boy the furnace
is
he wasn't originally going to be there
so everything's our fault in this in
this game so are you giving tidwell the
viking funeral here
yes yeah but but i'm going to start by
very carefully carrying the bowl of
blood over and putting it in so that
that gets burned first and then okay
right we're keeping the bowl to you know
get an idea after what
i don't think so if you want to study it
study it now because i'm getting rid of
it
i think it's we see what kind of stone
it's made out of
looks volcanic i would imagine it looked
like a lava stone yeah
and it's possible i
pour the blood into the furnace but then
i'd like to smash it on the ground to
see if it breaks open and there's
anything i can see
all right after a few smashes it it
cracks open
um the bowl looks the only
thing that seems remarkable remarkable
about it is that there's no dried
blood in it somehow all that like all
the blood that was in it
given how long that's been happening
that's incredible
yeah literally incredible
all right all right i'll go to pieces
and then
all right so it burns you say a few
words for
uh our fallen friend you deserve better
uh all right yeah





welcome back internet friends
the duchess is now
aboard a battleship
and the skiff comes back after you
have burnt
uh tidwell and they figure out how to
drop the anchor
after some time and
uh the sergeant is like all right
we're all heading back
all right oh talonsaurus has played the
haunting before
oh i mean it was it's pretty iconic
it is so that has been the adventure in
the back of the book
uh i have like five different versions
of the haunting i mean of course you do
that are all pretty much the same
although
i don't remember which one it was but
there was a kickstarter that
one of their stretch goals was they did
a um
an updated haunting and they like added
all this backstory and things like that
kind of cool
all right so they're they're
they once they got the anchor down
they're just gonna note down the
position of the ship
and head out and let the japanese know
when they get into uh
into port okay um
before but before we left the the engine
room area i would have like
scuffed out as much of that chalk circle
and all the rest of it as i could
because i don't want to leave that for
the japanese to find
what about that blood message in english
too
that wasn't a notebook i thought we took
that it was a piece of paper the guy
was just writing on a piece of paper
you none of you have taken that if you
want to you're welcome to i
i'm hesitant because i remember stanford
uh so i would take it very gingerly and
set it on fire as soon as i had a match
or a boiler room yeah yeah you throw it
in with the
yeah you throw it in and you burn the
message no problem perfect
all right so what follows is
three pretty miserable days of um
the duchess being very unhappy with the
service on this cruise line
uh she bemoans the lack of recreational
activities oh
and she is in a state room across from
you and you can hear her through the
walls usually
uh every time someone brings her food
she complains
about the you know there's a lot of
having to explain the chain of command
to her as you know um
and so three days later you dock in
shanghai
uh not sorry not in shanghai you you was
like
no you're actually in international
waters and
um the captain will once again
ask you uh
uh captain dave will ask you uh
to it's pronounced dave actually
but he'll ask you to go along on
the skiff
uh to meet with the um
to meet with the attache that you're
picking up all right
and so there are
it's it's about midnight
and there are semaphores going back and
forth between shore
and this boat this is clearly a
clandestine landing where they don't
want people to know that they
are are doing this and the skiff
this gift comes into a a dock pretty hot
and slows down like rapidly rapidly
decelerates
uh and boarding the ship at this point
uh is rogers and
um and someone you would now clearly
recognize as a migo
although he doesn't look the same as
johnson
just the way they walk and talk yeah and
the weird like
slightly fuzzy kind of something's
moving underneath their skin
uh gotcha gotcha hello rogers
uh what the hell is going
on good question no
good question we're trying trying for
darndest to try to figure it out
well i've been talking here with
johnson
and it seems like you've made some
allies
um i've made clear
to mr johnson just johnson
please right
i've made clear to johnson that
this is not any sort of treaty
um i have
i've got some assistance for the uh
that'll
ready for the island whatever delta
green can
can give us is gonna be ready to go uh
we're we're less than a day away
is there any reason to delay he's he's
like he's talking only to hollister at
this point
like the sergeant is just
wondering what the hell is going on is
i don't see how we could be any more
prepared than we are now
unfortunately all right um
johnson we're gonna be at gray dragon
island
is do we have any better idea than an
assault
is there should we
should we just blow the whole damn place
up we've got a battleship
can we do it from more than 20 miles
away
no because that appears to be the last
radius of the uh
warheads
and also getting getting back on to that
island after the warheads go to seal
what needs to be see
a trick well is there any reason we
can't blast the hell out of the beaches
i mean i remember
that the rocket was actually over like a
pool of lava right
yeah but the warhead wasn't attached to
it so the rock would be the only thing
that would potentially fall in if there
was any sort of uh
yeah beaches as long as we're careful
not to
hit the actual mountain on it too not
mountain what is it a mountain
it's the volcano yeah you know well can
a wheat yeah we can't we need the
volcano to be intact
all right well i mean
you know it's it's pretty standard naval
doctrine they can just lay down
some you know a bombardment on the beach
hopefully
get rid of anything that's on the beach
and we're more worried about the the
wooded area well we can clear that out
as well
cool good get the the beach and then
into the wooded area
and then the complex itself is basically
in the volcano
johnson kind of steps forward hello
regular earth humans
we when your bombardment is complete
we will enter the
we will enter the the base proper
no complaints i am i have a concern
that i don't know is if if it has been
discussed or addressed
stanford was not the last stanford is
dead
but stanford was not the last of what
was controlling things on that island
there is a woman named lady jezebel
and she does blood magic serious
blood magic serious
we found an exsanguinated japanese
officer on a
japanese destroyer on our way in and the
place was
deserted she is
gathering blood a lot of blood
so she is going to be the wrinkle
in all of this she is very powerful do
not underestimate her
aldridge has told me plenty about
this jezebel character
and if anything octavia might it might
have undersold it a bit
[Music]
i mean she doesn't understand this whole
blood magic nonsense and neither do i
i don't understand it but i know that
it's more powerful and
very real we've seen what we've seen
what normal magic can do
as a bonus we do not contain blood
that is very helpful bonus
so i agree that our that of
an assault is probably necessary but i
worry
that blowing the hell out of everything
on the on the island as necessary as it
is is going to give her more blood to
work with
hmm
if we blow it up though she won't be
able to collect it
i don't i yeah i don't i mean it seems
like she needs some sort of receptacle
probably and i cannot pretend to
know to say that i know much of anything
about blood magic i
avoid magic as a whole as much as i can
but i know that lady jezebel is
dangerous
and she has been empowered by
the entirety of a crew of a japanese
destroyer for a starter
it's a little worse than that the
japanese
sent a strike force uh
to try and take the island and i think
get a hold of the weapon
and for the past week there's been no
sign from that
i'm i'm not sure if it's my
least favorite or an acceptable outcome
but yeah
well dead might be the better option
there are lots of things that can be
done with bodies after they're dead
well here's the thing we're all gonna
you know
we're all gonna right now say that
they're dead because if we're if we
start blowing up that beach and there
that's a problem i understood
so yeah they're dead get ready to come
up with a reason why there could be
zombies on that beach
cause they're dead they were they were
casualties left from it from from a
previous assault that happened to get
stirred
up by all of them the firepower
concentrated on the beach
yep i am very uncomfortable with
falsehoods
well then you don't have to tell them
leave that to us
omission of facts is not a falsehood
uh so yeah you head back to the ship and
um
um rogers like goes directly to the
captain
and um
[Music]
with you along and
you know he'll just say captain i'm
afraid i'm gonna
have to initiate the omega protocols
oh my god and uh
the captain just looks at him and says
all right i'm looking to you for and
especially to you hollister
to tell me what we should do here and
unless i hear otherwise we're making
best possible speed to gray dragon
island and we're just gonna
blow the hell out of the beaches
anything on the anything on the shore
at what point at what point do we
release the men
sorry i missed almost all of that my
connection was completely true
he he's just saying like unless he hears
otherwise from you
the the battleship is gonna sail and
from about a mile away
just start blowing everything on the
shore it's it's gonna do a circle
a circuit of the thing and just blow the
blow everything on the beaches away um
and he asked the captain how many
marines he has
the captain says they have about a
do we want any soldiers to actually yeah
we actually i mean i'm
i'm much more confident with the migos
ability to go in after we've caused
chaos
disable it do we really want to send in
the soldiers
we are limited in number hmm
i am able to gather a dozen of my
are you able to get in and get out
discreetly with the
discretion will be hampered by us
oh will it be necessary to appear on
i cannot fly in this body yeah
they need to fly in and fly out
that makes sense so if we don't have a
lot of people
around that would be better yeah
uh everybody make me a spot hidden role
oh actually zero seven eighteen
super hard 56 regular right you are
all acutely aware that
rogers is um
rogers is definitely looking sideways
excuse me does he look normal
to me yeah he's not just
no roger seems you know as
stiff and and un uninterested in
pleasantries
he's looking sideways well he's just
like
he's sort of he always makes sure he
knows where you both are in the room and
he like will shift if you move
especially joan maybe not so much but
alexandra you know when someone
is like worried about you in a room and
he seems concerned
interesting i will file that away and
consider it
you know what i'm you know what i'm
gonna try these hot dice i'm gonna roll
psychology to be like what does that
mean
all right other than being concerned but
like
uh no 43 is nothing you've got plenty of
inspiration
that's true bloodbath
we have 14 inspiration do it
do it do it this is so
you know i think i've talked about i
don't have that much luck to make from
43 to 17 like i legitimately don't have
that much luck
so i talk i've talked about this before
but this is almost a con game
in the sense that you know they
all know
that there's no tomorrow for these
characters so
if anybody ends this with luck i'm gonna
be surprised
but the last role of the game is gonna
um all right did you use inspiration
sure i might as well i mean what the
hell right do it
all right let's see let's try the bar
novel dice hot dice
ooh close but knows you know what i will
spend the luck
to figure out and so what i would like
to determine is what is different
because he's never like he's always
known that she's
an assassin right all right so
i'm trying to yeah he's he's always
known what i am and who i am
what you got you got a regular success
yep i got well yeah i mean i have 17
so it's not like a regular like a hard
successes really
so the question is what is different
like what's his trigger that's what i'm
looking for
like what's the thing like what is
different this time around that he's
like
i'm concerned about her
like i'm looking for that nuance uh
so there's not a lot you can get from it
but in your head the dot
that you connect is there's now someone
that works for him
he's worried about us getting hollister
killed
you don't know you didn't make the role
but but emma that's the dot you connect
that
the only thing that has changed is that
somebody works for rogers in the party
now
so maybe there were ports courts
i'm sorry what did you say because my
head went someplace else what was that
possibly there's been some reportage to
rogers about
the various hijinks of the great dane
society who knows oh i thought dr
hollister and rogers were having an
affair through the mirrors
welcome to that's for the after the dark
emphasis on viewers
that's what happened in my hat i was
like oh he's concerned about you now
more more to the point there there have
been a lot of therapy sessions that he
that hollister and i have had so now
rogers knows the inner workings of my
head
oh lord no i haven't i haven't reported
on those
uh much more the belligerent i've
reported on the very belligerent things
that have happened
because i've never been belligerent in
my life
uh so but yeah but but uh
alexandra you are very aware and and
emma that is your
sort of that's your takeaway that you
know that's what's changed
all right yeah i'm i'm i'm now watching
um rogers out of the corners of my eye
just like i see you seeing me and i'm
going to keep an eye out
i'm an assassin if someone's watching me
that closely something's wrong
oh yeah no for me it's more like yeah
men
yeah i respect his abilities and i know
he knows mine
and he's worried about me so now i'm
unless anybody wants to do anything else
other than rest up you're gonna make
best possible speed for great dragon
island
off we go hollister rogers asks
you to hang back
oh crap i was avoiding having to explain
things
i was like don't be late
[Laughter]
i love it that's awesome
um not of course that there's anything
wrong with that
uh so uh
yeah he'll he'll just look you and he'll
say fraternization
there is something wrong with that i
make the rules uh
we've had some breakthroughs in that
portal technology
we're gonna have some delta green
available on the beach
i'm thinking i should stay here on the
ship to coordinate through mirror
communication
okay so i'm going to deploy a portal and
delta and
and delta green operatives will come
through that portal
all right so but you want me to get into
the compound
with that portal not on the beach right
i think that makes most sense yeah
he's like open this you'll get your
portal
the the timing the troops are gonna
be prepared
from anytime after we make
landfall they will be ready
but after a couple hours they'll
probably start to
they'll start to get antsy so the sooner
we can use them the better
uh and then um
i don't know do you want to like start
revealing stuff here nick since it's the
last episode
like what to to him to fill in the no
i've been using all sorts of
credible excuses to not yeah well well
that's why you're now alone in a room
and he wants to ask you about some stuff
oh maybe after the no i think
something terribly pressing yes is that
knight across
no you're sure yes
all right you weren't sure in your last
report
which i haven't given
regarding that since
uh yeah that would have been in kenya
no i was certain at that point i've
never i've never sent you a report where
i have not been
certain so she's safe
yes and uh
what about the other one we we've had
she's still incredibly dangerous but uh
she she recognizes what the risks are
i did not hear a verbal acknowledgement
no i know
there's there's a battle here and
i'll be pissed if we lose the battle
we're all doomed if we lose the war
all right the
the delta green operatives
have similar orders to you
and a lot less knowledge than you so
if they see anything sideways they may
act
that might wise considering the
situation
i trust everyone i trust everyone on our
team
they they know to look to you for
leadership but if they're alone
they're going to act on their orders of
engagement
i am i am completely confident in all
the members of my team
do not give them orders to not act on
them
um
i i don't know what's changed in the
past couple weeks but i'm glad to hear
it
we'll do all right uh
so anybody want to do anything before we
get to great dragon island
whatever rogers will rogers like
what do you want
i'll take whatever you got i'll give you
the big ones a couple small ones
do you have something that like launches
them because i really can't throw stuff
very well are you getting a mortar
launcher
yes yeah so that's essentially they have
a yeah they have
mortars are about the best they have
they have a they they will give you a
mortar
and you know like eight grenades
yeah i'm i'm i'm not worried about
concealing daggers anymore so i
have like knives strapped to everything
there we go
uh and and they give you just enough
training with that mortar
to make you realize that you have no
idea how to aim this thing
yeah as soon as they say the word as
soon as they say the word azimuth you're
like what
yeah i'm gonna just toss it towards the
hot lava
done and done ma'am i just wanna once
again reiterate
you don't toss the mortar you drop the
grenade
in the mortar you set the aim
and it fires the more the the grenade do
not throw the mortar
the mortar is a launcher okay
i know in practice you threw the mortar
[Laughter]
you can throw the grenades
but the mortar has like the leverage
where i can swing it real hard
like if i put it at the end of a rope it
would work so much better
like i get some centrifugal force and
just whip that thing
i'm staying 50 feet away from emma
during this at all times only
50 feet you know ma'am i think i can put
this in terms you might
understand borders don't explode
grenades explode okay so i need more
mortars is what you're telling me one
mortar for every united
no one mortar should be able to fire all
the grenades
okay one at a time i think i need to say
i i can't believe i need to make this
clear
as she leaves with the mortar the guy's
like they're dead
um at some point i do want to pull
hollister aside
your boss is giving me the stink eye no
it's not the
we are we're about to go into a
situation where i need to know that i
have you at my back
so yes now is the time no we're not
going to talk about what happened in
kenya
is that is that what the situation is is
that why he's
why worry about it you don't have to
worry about it
that is not something to put my mind at
ease
hollister when someone tells me not to
in this case the the amount that you are
worrying more
is less than what you would if you knew
and that's including
telling you what i just told you that
would be the most confusing episode
title ever
[Laughter]
am i going to get shot in the back no
you're confident
i've made it as clear as i could to him
to avoid that at all costs
got it well fair enough
i would be too in his shoes
somebody remember to ask about this next
week
yes uh
all right so i i needed i needed one
second with this
dr hollister as well because but my
my questions is more like all right all
right all right all right all right
we've got a couple of other weapons we
can use
i could try to summon the dholes again
see if i can get them to come out here
and start wreaking havoc
but do you think that would freak
everybody out i mean
if you do it before we're within 20
miles you risk
but if you can do it from further than
that how far can you control them from a
good question they were in the earth
they were not that far away though yeah
they weren't that far away
well right we still have seven hours
yeah if you wanna
see if you can get one in time okay the
other thing
um
no but my question because you might
want to change your order to rogers now
yeah right no listen
because of what we talked about because
of all the things that we've said i
wanted to ask you
do you think i could take power from the
beings
if if you went
in ahead of all of us but
i mean i yeah how
it i i haven't got to the point where i
can go one
two three four i haven't been able to do
that yet
i haven't been able to do that but i've
been able to get so i don't go
and suck everything out of somebody i
mean if you're in a situation
where you think you're isolated it might
be an option
but i would say don't be in a situation
yeah all right all right all right i
just i'm trying to think of what other
tools that i have that i could use for
this
i mean when the time comes
it might be worth it all right you're
just gonna have to make that judgment
call
well i'm glad we've talked about things
and you've given me some more
perspective on some of it so appreciate
it
of course all right
all right i'm done all right we're we're
done with all the emotional mushy gushy
stuff
what emotion that's no emotion stuff
it's all tools right it's things we
use i just want things to blow up
you and amy are closer than i ever
thought
uh all right so about
one hour before the island the ship goes
on high alert
um and
uh johnson who has been sort of waiting
with you on the deck
says please excuse me
this will probably be most unpleasant if
i do it around you and he starts to walk
towards the back of the boat
yeah go do your thing man i'm watching
uh oh
god i am not mean i don't need those
nightmares
there is a wait who's watching
all right there is a horrible sound
like you know the sound when you like
have a frayed sheet and you just rip it
it kind of sounds like that but wetter
um and as you're watching
uh joan yeah uh
it almost looks like johnson
like just rips open the back of his head
and bugs start to come out like
thousands and thousands of little bugs
and the the the skin starts to like
float down and the bugs form a
shape let's see i'm gonna make a luck
roll for the ship
nope nobody's there and the bugs form
into this huge single bug
somehow what was very clearly
thousands maybe millions of tiny little
bugs
form into one organism and they create
it it kind of looks like a stylized
hornet
where it's got like a kind of a curve to
it and there's like a clear thorax
um weirdly there's one wing there's only
one wing
and it's kind of a bat wing um
and this thing looks
back at you and it has six eyes
uh and the eyes look at you and they
one of them winks at you and then it
shoots off
uh maybe a sand roll yeah yeah
totally but oh you coolio johnson
oh yeah good thing i got that extra
sanity 52.
good old hollister good for something uh
you made it
yes by one all right you lose two sanity
and back down from that awful view
um and you don't want to think about the
small pile of johnson
yeah no i don't want to do that but that
was that was that was epic and he winked
at me
this is your chance to have a fireproof
go back up i'm johnson now
you know wearing someone else's skin
never goes wrong
never ever ever we've seen that movie
which one so
uh the ship goes on high alert
and about 30 minutes later
uh an amazing noise as
the big guns start to rotate and it
almost sounds like this grinding
uh uh
you know this grinding sort of like
[Music]
as they as the guns come around um
and are you gonna stay on the deck for
this we get earmuffs for this right
i'm not on the deck no way no why would
we no i'm i'm i'm
i'm assuming that there's earmuffs and
that there's a safe place for this i
i value i value my hearing i want to
they give you they give you
uh they give you a very good ear
protection
and you know you're you're welcome
on the bridge
there's on the bridge there's a
number of guys with binoculars
um it's dark and they are reporting
uh that there is no you know there are
no visible lights
on the island are we
uh do we have we put people on alert for
uh
deep ones coming up and trying to attack
the ship
uh yes yeah there are marines on the
deck of the ship
is there a spare set of a set of
binoculars i'm watching for i'm watching
for lady jezebel
because so most um
they're trying to keep non-uh trained
people
they're the binoculars are being used by
um we have pairs of didn't we get some
binoculars you don't have
you don't have navy you don't have like
these are good
these are like see along with these are
like c miles away binoculars
sure yeah if if if i spot a set of
binoculars not being used by someone
i'll snatch them but otherwise i'll
i'll leave them alone all right at
exactly
uh one in the morning their time
uh a a crewman looks at rogers
and rogers just looks at him and says
light it up
and the most god-awful noise you've ever
heard before
through even through ear protection as
these massive
13-inch cannons just start an unending
salvo kablam kablam
and every time they fire the ship
shutters
um and it
essentially the ship is doing a slow
circle around the island
and about six seconds
after every kablam there is a blossom of
flame
on the shore and it just
is it is clinical as there's just
this
kablam combine you know just this line
of explosions
going up and down these these men
um and this the the the bombardment
they do two laps around the island of
just
constant bombardment at a massive
cost to the american taxpayer
uh and they
um the i you know there's not a whole
lot to burn
on that island that small wooded area
definitely burns
um the spotters report that there are
bodies
on the on the on the beach
too far away to really see uh
and um
[Music]
but the spotters are like nothing's
moving on the beach anymore
oh yeah i've got like an extreme success
i got a 17.
nice i also got an extreme success 14.
all right with an ext so if you get a
regular success
you notice every once in a while um
a flare of light from the elder signs
on the hull with an extreme success
you see clearly a deep one
make it about a third of the way out of
the water
up on there before it hits an elder sign
and there's like an electric shock and
it falls back in the water
so what is that i don't know what they
look like what do they look like
they're the fish men so i don't know
these it's like a seven foot tall
bipedal fish
okay a kuotoa for you d and d
uh first edition d i don't know are kua
um so yeah every once in a while a
um you know you'll see one of them gets
zapped and kind of fall back into the
water as it hits one of the
um as when the bombardment stops
uh rogers looks at you and says
yep yes yeah all right do you want any
marines with you
they don't they don't know what's on
to send them well after us like if
like half an hour after us our plan is
actually to circle the island and
bombard the other beach as a distraction
sweet the marines may may well be more
of a a detriment
than a help because they don't know what
what's on that island they don't know
what they're getting into
okay unless you're willing to start
telling them about the mythos in which
case
have fun but if we're if if you know
this has to succeed so throw everything
in in 10 minutes the johnsons should
arrive
sweep all right let's go yeah
all right so there's a few minutes of
getting a this you're not on a skiff
you're on like a small
um a small motor boat heading
it is as you get close to the beach it
is a smoldering ruin
um of just their their gouts and craters
in the sand
and it has that like after a fireworks
show nitrate smell
and you you
come up on the are you
are you just gonna like pull the boat up
on the beach what are you gonna leave it
we need to get back let's let's let's
make sure we dock this
i'm not worried about getting back right
now yeah
let's go go ahead
here's the thing we're probably going to
run it ashore just to
get onto the beach quickly yeah yeah
we're not slowing down it's like full
speed ahead we'll slow down because we
don't want to get flung off of it
but we're going to be we're we're going
for a
good time as opposed to okay park the
boat carefully now come in slowly right
all the way through the water we're like
no we're going to get right up on it
yeah
all right getting it back off the beach
is going to be interesting but that's
not all
right you are about
i don't know you're about 50 feet from
shore
and all of a sudden on both sides huge
hooks come out of the water
and like hook on to the side of the boat
and they're they're trying they start to
i gotta go yeah oh i can start
shooting into the water in the direction
uh does anyone have an oh
does anyone have a knife
[Laughter]
no never
what do you need as if someone could
could cause i'm assuming these are on
these they're either
hook spears in which case they're very
easy to shoot these things
or these things are on ropes and we're
getting pulled in if there are hope
so yeah all right so we're gonna
slide into initiatives real quick
uh they and we did get we got we got
ourselves guns
to go onto the beach i i i still have
the handgun that i
have from donald yeah they they will arm
you
however you you know however you feel
cool this would be a perfect time to
drop a grenade in the water
ooh
all right man it's been so long so
i've done an initiative i've ever gotten
the initiatives 90s 80s
70s as alexandria i'm i'm going to
like shift back and draw the the handgun
that donald left me
and shoot into the water at these things
all right make a
make a handgun roll these are not good
okay cool 22. all right that's a hit uh
you do what is it a d8 i think
 i don't know it's a 1d10 all right
a d10
sure they are in water so i'll give
them a dodge
all right roll your damage yeah oh wait
i'm going to use
i'm going to use inspiration oh
wow wow you got a critical fail wow i
rolled the night yeah wow
all right damn sweet that is my first
time on the emma board
congratulations congratulations i'm
aboard on the last episode
yeah yeah so this like one of the
fish guys just looks up at you
stupidly and like you go to shoot him
and he like just
keeps looking at you and you just blow
65. everybody
make me everybody make me a size
roll what
did yay all right so that's a hard
success so we need two successes yeah
yeah i gotta say i got a niner
so they are trying to like yank the
boat
under and so you managed to like
counterbalance but the whole thing goes
like this yeah okay
the you you have a feeling the next time
that happens there will start being dex
rolls
uh that was so 65 joan
i'm gonna try to shoot i am going to try
to shoot now i
also take a handgun i'm going to have a
handgun roll it's
not going to work you have the base
aren't you better with rifles i remember
you being very good with a rifle
i know i i'm better with a
rifles take one oh
and then use a rifle okay i'll use the
rifle there are rifles take one oh and i
can use it to bash too cool all right i
got it
they're like crowbars that shoot things
exactly
all right i am going to nominate that as
as a quote to put in there
that's a good one okay i like crowbars
that shoot things
i don't my quotes are not you have to
it's great
can luck be used on that kind of a roll
yeah you can spend luck sweet i need to
bed spend
three luck right you spend that three
luck
and now you hit right yes all right so
2d6 is your damage
he's gonna make a dodge roll i'm gonna
spend another inspiration
yeah this is kind of addictive once you
start doing it so it's three and three i
got six
god that's an amy whew
amy you're infectious yep it's not great
but this is the best time
this is the best you you roll your
damage 2d6 i got
i got six all together six all right
yeah he takes damage for sure
uh that was 60s 50s 40s
cameras can i stab somebody with my
not it and now the big reveal not like
somebody so that flew out of my hand
um i don't know i mean should i try and
do it again what do you think you're not
drunk
it's the problem yeah where's my
fighting sword fighting i'm like i can't
even find my damn stats
what are you looking for your damage or
for your no drunken sword fighting is
like
a 38 and i rolled a 48 boom all right
that's not
you've got inspiration that's true do it
do it
oh nope never mind
oh you thought it you thought you
i just saw a 90 and then what looked
like a seven until i went like this and
it's a one i was like oh boy
okay never mind you really took us then
you know then it would have been you
would have had to stab nick because he
goes not it oh
why i fall off the boat and that's the
last christian hollister
curse your sudden but inevitable
betrayal
um i almost wore that shirt today too
nice
yeah so yeah you um
you did not yeah you did not cover
yourself in glory but you did cover
yourself in water as a big splash
shooting up from the all right
hollister close this out yeah
uh am i close range oh yes all right uh
so that would that will cancel out the
disadvantage of unloading on it
oh yeah just bam bam okay
so there's a hard
success there's a not success
and then there's a not success all right
well the hard success hits he does not
dodge that
um i'm going to spend an inspiration
okay
man it's addictive isn't it yeah
that's another amy god dug it i've i've
i haven't been on any of these boards
and all of a sudden i'm like
i'm now fourth in amy's just by that
is that max max damage yep hard success
is max damage
10 damage all right he did not love that
uh there is definitely blood in the
water yeah
did i roll inspiration on one of my
shots
sure yeah what are you real inspiration
he wants inspiration
okay thank you on both of the ones that
missed if you want
well let's just do one okay and see how
that goes
get a critical success what nice
uh and so that is 13 damage all right
well the second bullet finishes them off
for sure
yes oh my gosh everything stopped
so okay you're back i can still hear
you now that the round is over
i'd like to ask the musical question
who's driving the boat
we're a little more concerned about
keeping it from being dragged under
water at the moment
all right so the so the boat is just
like zooming for like essentially
like everyone took their hands off of
everything to go and kill these things
now we're gonna grab i'll grab back onto
the cause i've done the piloting stuff
before so i'll grab back on to that
okay um
so you won't just start going in a
circle then correct
um so you're still aiming for the beach
whatever happens you guys make me a
pilot roll
uh-oh and we lost nick
he will be back shortly oh actually i
don't i thought i had piloting but i
don't
well that's exciting you had truck
driving though
oh that's what it was it was all it was
i don't i could i thought i thought i
had pilot bits it was driving the i
thought i
thought i had that but you also drove
the motorboat before
that's what i thought that wasn't good
you must not have made the roll
because we did we did i gave i think we
got a a cheap auto one like you get i
got half of what i rolled or something
yeah something like
isn't it better if you don't do a good
job
i wanted to stay pointed at the island
yes
yeah so i mean okay go ahead and make me
a pilot roll
you're not gonna i mean it's not gonna
be hard to stay pointed at the island
unless you roll really badly yeah no
it's i rolled into 18.
no you're good yeah so the yanking
you're now
um you will have a penalty die on this
roll
unless you either get rid of all
these hooks
or spend your whole time driving the
boat
i'm going to spend my whole time driving
the boat and those guys are going to do
the
right thing we'll deal with that next
round yep all right
hopefully nick will pop up before the
initiative 70s alexandra
um are any of them close enough to stab
yeah because they're they're i mean um
yeah but i wouldn't miss not that you
can miss with knives i was gonna say
yeah i'll i'll draw one of the like so i
i'm not worried about concealing anymore
so i have a hunting knife on my thigh
that i'll draw and like stab at them
all right when you lean over to stab
the water is just teeming with the it's
like salmon
uh spawning or something you just you
see
just so many of those horrible fishermen
down there
all right well my my goal is to get the
one who is holding the hook right now
and try to get that hook off of our boat
all right so take roll your knife
uh 65 success right roll your damage
well wait he gets a dodge
did you get a hard success i got a
regular success good lord if 65 was a
hard success
that would be so he actually like dodges
in the water
and i re-roll that friends yes
yes you've got inspiration i'm gonna
keep his dodge roll because it was
pretty good
yeah okay oh
i'm five critical wasn't that good
so thomas did a great job of getting
everybody back
in the in the stream except i'm like
looking in here
let's see if this works i'm gonna let's
little down a little down a little i'm
like kilroy right now
kilroy was here there we go that's
pretty good yeah
i'm like hanging on a cliff here it's
very funny ah there you are there you
are
all right so yeah you
you that is so that's double damage
seven points of damage all right he did
not enjoy that
i want to try and like get the hook
while he's distracted from like the pain
lift up and try to
get the hook up and off up off and
over so
that's a separate action you can stab
him or you can try and unhook the boat
okay i'm hoping that someone's close
enough to unhook
all right on a 65
uh joan you go first you're driving so
make a pilot roll
you have you do not have a penalty
die on this
uh nope i got an 88 this time so it's a
little bit more all right
there's no fumble you are you feel
the the forward progress of the boat is
definitely slowing
you're gonna need at least one success
to get to the island
let's see i'm gonna say that a d3 more
hooks come up
two more hooks come up all on the same
side
bird's a parrot dice
bloody birds of paradise cool 11
critical
wow well all right you all rolled very
well except for joan
um i rolled an odd one
so the boat like yanks and like the
um the the side of the boat actually
goes
underwater briefly and comes back up um
everybody that didn't get a critical
success roll me a dex make me a dex roll
oh no oh and joe do you have a
penalty die on this
no you know what i'm holding on yeah
you're holding on you're good yeah
you're holding
which one's which one's the critical
it's the second one right yeah no
totally pretty cool
no problem all right yeah you hold on oh
i want to see more of him swimming i got
a
four so i think i can turn it all right
so um
the boat like i said it just jerks
really hard but you are all well
prepared
and and you hold on that was 60s emma
and then hollister
by the way it is clear that these things
do are not bothering to attack you
they'd rather just
get you in the water and do horrible
things to you in the water yeah yeah
yeah i just want to get onto that beach
damn it start grabbing their hooks man
uh emma yes um
do i think i'm strong enough to unhook
the hooks
a strength roll would help you find out
um but
so is that what you want to unhook the
hook yeah so who's like the closest
like oh you know what no i don't i'm
going to take the mortar
all right taking this precision
instrument
a border is not a precision instrument
okay i think i'm pretty good at that too
um where's it's under apps isn't it
yep i just made it exactly nice
and i'm get you know my rules apply to
me as well i cannot inspire a fumble so
you who hit this guy well there is no
dodge here
uh rolling damage so what is that
like a i have a 1d3 plus zero apparently
this will do a d6 plus your damage bonus
okay
um and that damage bonus is zero so
that's two
all right yeah crunch you you smack him
down he did not enjoy that
hollister is there a spare uh
hook from one of the we we killed some
of these right there yeah there's a
uh well no they're grabbing whatever
hook like there's
there's just these things are endless
under the water and so every hook
as soon as somebody falls down another
hand grabs it well i mean is there then
in that case is there something that i
could
use to leverage underneath the hooks to
pop robar i have my there's a crowbar
lying right on the deck
yeah here you go all right so make me a
strength roll with
uh i'll give you a bonus die because of
i'm gonna not use the cursed dice oh man
yeah i'll take the 13
which is a hard success all right yeah
you you wedge off
so there were there were four hooks
i am famous by the way for starting
these counters and then rolling the die
that the counters on and forgetting like
all right that is the end of the
round back to the top of the lineup
alexandra
okay seeing the salmon
sea of of people i'm gonna i'm
understanding that killing them is
not going to do much
i'm going to try to get the hook out
okay grenade actually is starting to
sound like not bad
i don't have grenades i'm not talking to
you
i am an assassin i am a precise weapon
grenade
i wasn't talking to you i have some bad
news precise weapon make me a strength
roll
yeah i know oh thing
 ought six critical all right
yeah you you you you wedge off
another one there are now two hooks
okay that was 70s 60s joan
you're driving make a pilot roll get a
six i can spend five
are you serious and get my one
there we go all right let's do it all
right
all right at the end of this round this
boat will beach itself
uh joan make me a luck roll okay
i got it under 46 from 50. all right so
yeah you you even managed to decelerate
uh some of it so that you will not be
flung out of the boat
uh all right that was it also on a 60
uh these poor things they're gonna try
and
one last time to yank the boat over
there's only two of them so they don't
get a bonus die this time
so everybody make a size roll
pretty good roll 35 success
ooh hard or regular regular yes okay
so that's two successes i'm gonna spend
the six luck and like get rid of that
what what the hell my luck is we can we
can just re-roll that we have plenty of
inspo
yeah i see it i see it i got you there's
worse things to come
we have ten in spo and this is the last
session
[Music]
yes i made it by three this time around
right there you go
uh that was the success you needed to
not have the boat yank over
uh so the boat oh wait hollister
sorry hollister
what oh yeah
i mean i'll i'll pop another one off all
right make me a strength roll
pop off oh wait emma
do you want to blow anything up what is
yours yeah of course i do i'm gonna lob
one of these like so my move is gonna be
like as we like zoom in i'm just gonna
be like boop and throw it up
and then just watch it like just to kind
of keep people from like
i love this game you gotta break it a
little
it's just a baseball lob just a
little underhand softball situation
all right yeah make me a throw roll
um yikes under tease
yup i know i'm just looking for that if
it's underhanded it's with the bonus
dice
right that's how underhand works right
yeah well it's underhanded
you know oh for awake from making it do
i spend it
four do it four yeah so i'm gonna spend
the four luck
wherever the hell that luck is on the
sheets all right so i mean yeah
another point of that this is a con game
let's do it yes so
yeah yeah you slide that in there you
throw it up um
uh and hollister your last
action before yeah i'll try another one
all right strength roll uh
22 is a hard success yeah you there is
one
one hook will will now hangs limply off
the side of the boat as it beaches
itself
and right behind it is this gout of
water shoots up into the air
and you see at least one fish guy like
flying up into the air
um and that seems to have dislodged them
all from the boat
um and it appears that they are not
coming on shore
yes oh man can i have that hook can i
have that hook that would be awesome
sure yeah
you can i mean allister's
yeah pass it back he gives you back the
crowbar but yeah you've got a bone hook
yeah oh god those things
so you are on the shattered beach
you see bodies of
uh spiders to answer a question
that hollister had
they still have stanford's head on them
um the everything here has just been
blasted to hell good okay
make our way up to the
the the keep i guess all right yeah
you you head up there you are i mean
there's
there's everything like i said has been
blasted to hell when you reach
the the top and start to go down that
that that spiraling thing you hear
um a chorus
of voices raised in a chant
and you also hear from kind of far away
a buzzing sound
hmm and can prepare us for what we're
about to see so we're not completely
shocked
can what now can land prepare us for
what we're about to see so we're not
completely shocked yes
yes yeah cause i i just like oh i
recognize that that noise
and i said guys guys guys hear that
buzzing noise
just describe what i'm not shooting no
no they're
they're they're bugs remember they said
they had wing wings
wing they have a wing they have one wing
let's go deal with the chanting people
first all right
one week bugs don't shoot chanting
people shoot
one one wing bug big big okay
i mean come on it filled up that skin
not my favorite thank you all right
let's do this yeah
yeah yeah that's all yang is saying it's
all good bugs bugs no stabbing got it
yep yep all right so amigos
oh i got it that's the second time that
joke's been made tonight ezra
i'm leaving the stream
[Laughter]
we win
uh i storm off and i'll be in my
trailer
um and we stomp handily through
everything and blow up the island
so as joan is saying that like
over her
head 10
horrible black
inky gross weirdly kind of
wet bugs fly
over the edge and immediately start
heading down
for the middle the chanting
does not stop
all right and you guys are starting
to run
down everyone you can see
everyone is down in the in the bowel
down around the weapon and
uh the weapon has been
recessed into the floor you can just see
it sticking up
and you see hundreds of
people they seem like people just keep
walking forward and lady jezebel stabs
them
and the blood goes into the weapon
and she is leading the chanting but
all of these people that you now see are
japanese soldiers
are are are bleeding into the
weapon
um and so
um she looks up and and the the me go
distract her
uh from seeing you and
she points at some of the japanese
soldiers and points at the migo
and they start like firing at almost
robotically
at the migo and the migo are like
taking evasive action
uh trying to avoid them but it's
definitely slowed their advance as you
keep running down
and she keeps slicing people um
and i'm supposed to remind people
that
we're gonna do one final giveaway for
this calendar
we're gonna do that drawing at 9
30 come heck or high water we might run
a little long this session
just because but we're gonna do that
drawing at 9 30
or whenever thomas hits the drawing i
know i'm just like
where are you hashtag chaos
to be entered to win that again
continental u.s
or canada because i'm mailing it myself
and i don't want to
chaos contact chaos
and we'll we'll we'll do that final
drawing
um so back because screw you come back
you're you're you're heading down um
what what is your plan what do you want
to do
i am focused on lady jezebel and i am
moving toward her come hello
oh maybe maybe go with the hell or high
water instead
what if we provide cover fire for joan
and she can get close and just drain all
of them
can she i'll try and i might be able to
bring in
my let's plan on bringing in more cover
um you you can i mean
you don't you can just do it anywhere
you don't have to do it i know but it's
cooler if they come out of the bathroom
all right they were in my bathroom the
whole time
yeah all right you you can easily veer
off and you're like
make covering fire for joan i have to go
to the bathroom
just like okay of course
whatever mate yeah he's gotta
get it he just doesn't want need the
rest of you to have to he's got a
scaredy bladder that's what he's got ibs
all right so so you three continue
down the ramp
hollister you get in there and you pull
out the tuna can
and it's got the little key open thing
as you're like
pulling that and as you open it inside
you see a um
a shriveled sad kind of shivering little
spider
and as you let it out it kind of starts
to come to life
um and at the exact moment when it
realizes
that that it is free
it balloons into a portal um
this portal is quite large it takes
and stepping through the portal first
uh is is professor aldridge
and she looks around oh i guess we can't
but we had armored vehicles ready to go
oh no i told rogers that we were gonna
we're inside the base yeah we were still
gonna well anyway
um i've got i've got a hundred commandos
ready to go
do you want me to bring him in yeah we
need cover fire
all right so they start coming in
and these are soldiers they are carrying
clear shields that have elder signs on
them
and they all have they all have
pistols
uh and so they just start coming in
and you know they're going they start
forming up
and and aldridge aldridge says what's
there's some sort of horrible blood rich
tool going
on at the bottom where lady jezebel is
feeding blood into a bomb
uh professor lam is going down to try
and drain them all and knock
them out so she can't get any more blood
and the migo
are flying around trying to secure
the weapons right
so see you outside all right yeah
you take off and she's gonna follow you
um
and the men are forming up and they're
coming out so there's
a bunch of them coming out and they're
gonna start firing
at the japanese all right you guys get
down there um
and how are you how are you both kind of
giving
well i i have one of donald's rifles
slung over my shoulder i'll just to just
start
shooting and just like drawing attention
away
all right emma what are you doing um
i'll probably just use
one grenade and just sort of roll it
into like the clump
of them if there's clumpiness make me a
luck roll
actually you know what i'm going to try
my hand in this mortar business
oh all right it might take a while
um and when you say make me a luck roll
i'm going to say probably not
because 87 is not close to like 20.
all right so so you set the mortar
down
and it did not enjoy being a club
uh so it's gonna be its
accuracy is questionable
good if you well i'm just if you miss
there's gonna be a chance
20 20 mile radius 20 mile radius
you hear hollister's words in your head
no you hear me shouting down the
windings
that's right you pull out the fire
against just like
my radius and and you hear alexandria
near you just murmuring if we if we die
here stopping this it's fine
yeah let's go for it it'll be fine and
oh what could go wrong
and i'm concentrating i'm concentrating
on concentration
i got nothing to say about this i'm
concentrating yeah yeah you have started
the
let's just all right we'll find out
shortly
um so uh
hollister you're about halfway down uh
aldridge like is
keeping pace with you and she says
there's something i have to do
and she jumps off the side like flinging
herself
down oh i thought she was going to stab
and as she's flying down she screams
jezebel and she pulls out
what looks very much like the sword of
Akmala
the the non-uh uh
one and that actually gets jezebel's
attention
and jezebel just looks up at her and
smiles
uh and aldridge is now like um
uh he's now floating a few feet above
jezebel
and aldridge just starts swinging almost
wildly with this with the with this uh
glowing sword and jezebel keeps
throwing up tarot cards uh
and every time she throws up a tarot
card it like turns into a shield
that the sword hits and so aldridge is
just like
um this is the least in control you've
ever seen aldrich
uh as as whatever veneer of civility
she had has cracked and she's just like
wildly hammering down
um but it is a fine distraction um
uh so alexandra make me so
alexander make me a rifle roll let's see
how well you're doing with the
distraction
sweet 13 hard success right excellent
you shoot some guys
emma don't make it a luck roll
i'm trying to think of what your mortar
skillet do do you have an explosive
skill
i mean here's good i mean
i should have had you know what we'll
call it
a let's call it a throw with a bonus die
it's the big one okay never mind i had
to i was like
i encourage you not to fumble this it's
new
yeah i'd like to not blow up today
although maybe it would be funny if we
rebooted friends
oh i got a 71 and a 31 the 31
makes it all right so yeah you managed
to
mortar deeper into the guys
and blow a bunch of them up you you blow
up the line that was heading towards
jezebel
and you when you do that you notice that
she stopped cutting them because of
aldridge's
um distraction
uh joan make me a power roll are you
trying to suck
the energy from jezebel from the
soldiers indiscriminate
indiscriminate out that way not not not
my buddies
i don't i mean indiscriminate is
indiscriminate
yeah indiscriminate period no no no no i
when i'm
okay get jezebel man no no that's not
gonna say
i wanted to focus on her because now
she's not i was gonna go for the
japanese but now that she's gotten about
make me a cthulhu mythos role all right
i'm gonna do the cathedral first
and i'm gonna spend two luck and then i
make it
all right wow that's terrifying um
blood magic doesn't work like pow stuff
you're not sure how effective or what
you're gonna get from
leeching her yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
i mean all of her magic points she'll
draw i'm
within 30 seconds of just running and
stabbing her man well
okay so i'm gonna i i the the these poor
soldiers they're gonna get it anyway i'm
gonna take it from them
all right yeah you start to just siphon
up
um it almost looks like that that domino
rally thing as soldiers just start
falling over
oh that's a hard success all right you
are going to gain
five yes you gain 40 pow
um and three soldiers just fall over can
i get more than a hundred on pounds oh
yeah oh okay
wow you're gonna need it
uh she's gonna all right oh there's a
spell that
you should use on lady jezebel
i'm slow all right uh
that was now that i have power
all right um
so aldridge and jezebel continue their
fight and
jezebel draws a tarot card
looks at it smirks at
uh smirks at aldridge
and says you know what the tower means
don't you
and throws it at her and
uh the tower i should have gone with the
squirrel joke nick
bastard and the tower
wraps around aldridge pulls her down
and her body impales on the point of the
weapon
and her blood starts to seep into the
weapon
uh and jezebel's eyes flash red
you're too late and
everything starts to rumble aldridge was
all the power i needed damn all right
let's see i'm gonna go around the
table what uh
emma can you get to the sword
yeah her sword like skitters down yes
absolutely
all right yeah this round you are you're
running for the sword
what are you doing i mean cover fire
i guess trying to
shoot any soldiers that might be near
the sword so she can get a path to it
all right yeah you you
you blo you blow him away all right uh
alexandra what are you doing
yeah 38 made it all right yeah yeah you
this if you can this round get to her
i'm
i'm drawing daggers and going for her
all this much in so long yeah that's
a hard success
okay so my goal then is to get her
off of the weapon before i stab her
all right well your first goal is to get
there you found the path
so you will get there next next round
i'm going to basically i'm going to try
to take her out of time
okay i'm going to try to slow her down
so she cannot react against us when we
i've been taking a lot of time looking
at it and
and and going for it so i am gonna go
for it
yeah all right uh
make me a power roll which should be
nope that is a 75
and i'm trying to figure out if that's
hard or simple you want to
inspire yeah sure let's inspire that
why would i want to inspire that so i
get it
to get a hard success or better yeah
okay 75 102 i need to half
would be 50. so i need 50 lower you have
a 50 50 chance of getting a hard success
all right guys and then the rest of your
luck
i did not make it i actually got a
little bit higher
okay 79 this time all right
no it wasn't a fumble but it wasn't
aiming
all right i did it did make it it wasn't
a hard success
yeah so you you
reach this thing out to jezebel yes um
and she's there's she's focused on
alexandra who's coming towards her
but all of a sudden she looks at you and
she draws a card
and she looks at you and says in this
case death does mean death
and she whips the card at you
okay oh you should make a dodge roll
you're gonna make the dodge roll of all
dodge rolls because spoiler alert
oh it's a paradise
andrea you betrayed us again
[Music]
okay i am doing a dodge
uh-huh i got a 14.
my heart success is 11. so i can
i could do three luck and that would
give me well that's the feed
that'll give you a critical size i think
you need critical you're going to need a
critical success yeah spend
three to get the critical yes wait hold
on so you only need okay that gets you
to the so
wait your dodge is that high wow my my
my my dodge is half of my decks
so my dodge is
57 sure yeah so 11
is my 11 is my great so yeah three this
this card like comes winging at you and
as it
flies it like takes the head off of a
couple soldiers as it's coming towards
you
and you just at the last second dodge
out of the
like actually your time spell goes
off but it hits the card and the card
starts to rotate
you just see it rotating slowly and you
just watch it go by yes
um all right that time spell roll me
no that one went out of the box just a
second
four all right that costs you four magic
oh but you know what you gained with
your pow you gained two magic points
oh okay that's what i needed to know so
you'll drop two essentially
okay all right
uh really thought i had somebody with
that oh seven
that was once around for everybody uh
okay everybody make me luck rolls oh
i have roll the number of successes i'm
looking for here we go
now cool 14 is a hard success
you're welcome you only needed two
successes oh god
all right well i would have made it
too
cool those three successes thank you
uh all right we're going around again
so let's start with
alexandra you make it to jezebel
she will not leave this thing um
and she has drawn
she draws a card the page of staves and
she's like wielding it like a sword
and she just looks at you and and she
says
i'm gonna make this the world i deserve
i'm gonna be a constant why are you
trying to stop me
because you're not a constant and you're
i'm going to rebuild everything make it
better you're going to kill everything i
care about and that's all i care about
right now
all right i'm assuming you want to
stab her oh absolutely
sweet that is a critical success 12.
all right you go to stab her and your
knife goes through her
and she goes did you actually think i
would be standing on top
of a weapon that's going to destroy the
world
yes i think you're dumber than i thought
you were
i think you are actually that insane no
right now i'm on your battleship
and if we're about to start opening fire
i know blood and that's a sentence
has she actually been slicing throats of
the japanese sailors of the japanese
people in front of me yes
how we'll fight we'll find out
uh emma what are you doing um
you saw alexandra get up there try to
stab her her blade went through
hmm there's all kinds of there's kind of
rumbling
uh the whole the whole volcano is
shaking
as like steam is coming up where the
weapon is
where's hollister hollister is at the
lip of the
the path he's just shooting guys with
his rifle
okay so i tried do i hear the fact that
she's i thought you said you were laying
down covering fire
no rifle oh sure with a pistol pistol
okay he's much closer then
and we didn't bring the statue did we we
don't have the statue of the statue
okay you were planning on doing the
ritual later and also
you know we're several days after the
full moon yes yeah
i'm just saying might not be as powerful
but we could have still tried
um so i said
did i hear the fact that she's on the
ship you heard her claim that yes
okay so i yelled a hulk oh you know what
can i go
coming from the catholic person that's
hilarious yeah
use the sword just use it exactly i'm
just gonna verify i'll be like you know
what
let's let science work this out and i
try and stab her with the sword
let's science work this out here's the
magic sword
[Laughter]
oh all the dumb stuff this is my science
magic sword i love it any
you know any any very advanced science
looks like magic
oh all right yeah amigo would disagree
with you
make me a drunk make me a this is the
epitome of drunken sword fighting
yeah pretty much dumb sword fighting
right here we go
do it oh i can can i i'm going to be so
out of luck pretty soon i'm can i spend
four to make it hit i'm just going
forward to make it hit do it yes
all right your blade see your blade
finds her
you slice into it i thought so um
and she's like ah i almost had you um
and
roll your damage i don't know what
drunken sort but
um and again it's a two all right you
but i mean
you sliced her and she did not care for
that and you notice
when her blood hits the weapon there's
like a
s nice
um hollister what are you doing yeah
i'm shouting for the migos to come down
and
disarm this all right the soul like so
your troops
have just started like marching with
this phalanx of shields and they are now
um they're now just like they've come
down and they're waiting into the
japanese just like blam
uh okay and yeah you yell at the migo
uh alexandra what are you doing um
knowing that jezebel is there i'm gonna
take another swipe at her
you don't look at me like that i i yes
uh okay make me a
did three
all right so your blade passes right
through her you're gonna need
she can only be struck by magic weapons
um that's what you'll get with that with
that success you'll realize that you
know
that's what i was trying to hitting her
you like are hitting her with it also
with a knot 3
you notice aldridge's sword lying right
by the weapon
okay on on my next turn i'm gonna go
for it yeah you can scoop it up and pick
it up right now
all right all right and bring it up
between us i'm gonna try
i'm gonna try to slow her down again
okay
i'm gonna use some inspiration okay good
i'm
i'm down to seven you do you
you definitely win that one all right um
okay
three
uh all right you spin three magic
points
and um
jezebel is like moving through molasses
uh and i think that is everybody
they're gonna need some good rolls here
guys come on
can we re-roll luck yes
as long as as long as it's not a fail a
fumble yeah you have a phone probably
you can spend inspiration so can i do it
do it can i critical success on luck
yes did you oh yeah then i got a
critical story that's good you're gonna
need it that's four
successes there's no way
44 forget 44. all right five is what you
needed so joan gets you there
the weapon there's the rumbling of the
weapon
increases and it is
um it is it is starting to uh
really shake this whole cavern um
so amy
and and alexandra um
you're both like you see jezebel
and she looks at both of you
reverse psychology that's what the devil
would say
stab again all right both of you like in
a weird
almost in concert you both just plunge
your swords
into her and
um
and the cavern keeps rumbling and all of
a sudden there's a lot of very confused
japanese sailors
and soldiers getting shot by american
soldiers
stop stop shooting stop holly
uh ultrafire hollister
at this point thank you um
the migo have come down
and one of them lands by joan and looks
at her
and says tell me about this stasis
device
of yours it's not a device
how do you do this it's magic
[Music]
i do what i do uh
the guy looks at you and he says will
you come with us
nope i've got work to do here can you
help me i am mistaken forgive me
i made that sound like a question
let me correct my grammar you will come
with us
no no i won't take care
of the weapon first or there'll be
nowhere they need your help
[Music]
uh so so the migo

uh and the migo come down and look at
you both
and say i would recommend
yeah i'll i'll grab emma's hand and pull
and start running
all right the last thing as you start
to run
you see the nine migo
are like crowding around the weapon
and they are it looks like they are
sort of trying to create a downdraft by
um at this point the
the one next to you joan yes

but you
these people need me i need to be here
and now i'm gonna i'm gonna try to to to
uh
kids because psych isn't gonna help i'm
just gonna leave i'm just gonna walk
away
all right so
uh joan starts to walk away and
the three of you have gotten to the uh
uh you emma and alexandra you got
to
uh hollister who is corralling the
soldiers and telling them to stop and
like getting everybody up the ramp
joan is starting to head for you and you
see this migo
flash its its forearm
right across her forehead and
um scoop and essentially scoop into a
a jar joan
what was all that about consent
yeah joan you are in a jar
but you are aware you are in a jar and
you still have
okay wow
because i still have points left
i'm going to yell get that woman a car
body
[Laughter]
oh transformers were around in the 20s
oh my god i'm trying to figure out what
i can hit him with because
i mean he can make him stop but
can i make it go backwards can i make
time go backwards
i'm gonna try i'm gonna try i'm gonna
try to make time go backwards so my head
i go back into my own head
i love it all right make me a
power roll
come on joan spend all the luck
uh it's 59 so it's
all right about half if you get if you
get to a critical success
i will give you that cool thing critical
can i reroll guys
we have we have the we have the info
okay so critical success for 102
is one-fourth of that one-fifth fifth
one
twenty-eight twenty-somethings
like twenty-one maybe no i didn't make
it i got forty-three i mean i'm under
but i'm not critical yet how much luck
do you have look
i have 45 luck use it
it'll put your head back in your body i
mean
dump 20 luck into it make it full i'm
down yes i am
uh yes all right all right yeah so
um you three watch in horror
as the head gets sliced off
and then all of a sudden you see
everything happen in reverse
and joan is like walking away and
without looking joan just
ducks when the slice would come and
keeps walking
uh and the migo its head
and as it does that the weapon launches
with nine migo attached to it and they
look like they are kind of like
zooming it along and it just shoots
straight up into the air
and there is no explosion and the tenth
guy
um looks at
as you're walking away and he says
you could have taught you could have
brought magic
to all the worlds of the universe
and what follows is some really
uncomfortable cleanup
as the japanese tried to figure out why
the americans were shooting them
and you know a hundred american soldiers
try to figure out how they're gonna get
home from this place
oh it's about to say is the portal not
still i mean
sticking around for a little bit you
haven't you haven't checked the yeah the
portal is why it is open still so you
can that's what i
and i think that is where our tail ends
with
the weapon not having exploded the migo
have taken it off
