and then you add in
our interstitial entertainment we just
had a new episode
of warren and aaron pretend like they
agree on things
they that should be the name of that
show but warren and aaron
discussing the movie parasite
uh you know i think that's the most
modern movie they've discussed at this
point
wow they're we've dragged them kicking
and screaming into modern cinema
uh so we just posted that
uh there's gonna be new episodes of
gloomhaven amy and tom are playing
gloomhaven jaws of lion
draws the lion which man so i don't know
uh
uh if you saw this amy but gloom
gloomhaven just finished its big
kickstarter for frosthaven yeah and then
john the lion came out
and everybody said we love the flipbook
map
in jaws the line so much that we want
that for frosthaven and poor isaac was
like
well we just made thousands of tiles so
no
so he's actually going to make uh
flipbook maps for those who don't know
um if you've seen our blue maven show
there's tons of tiles that we lay down
and we're putting stuff on there
for jaws of the lion it's just a an
eight and a half by eleven book that you
flip to a certain page
and all the rules are right there and
the map is right there and it's super
compact it's well done
uh and the uh
the sadly they don't have that for frost
haven but they're gonna make that
both for the original game and for
frosthaven for people who want it
they're gonna sell it separately
um i'm totally in on that but so uh
thomas and amy playing
uh playing gloomhaven it's the only
socially distanced gaming
probably going on out there right now i
don't know
uh and and if that's on youtube you
can you can find that on youtube there
uh and then another episode of the
untitled podcast will be coming out
sometime you don't know when next
weekish
next weekend it's a surprise yep
between now and the end of the year
[Laughter]
that's a guarantee wow i can get behind
that
yeah that is a we have got a solid time
frame that we guarantee by the end of
the year there will be an episode
of the untitled actually let me rephrase
that i can guarantee between now and the
end of the year something's going to
happen
i mean okay that that seems more
uh i think that's it for announcements
so uh
uh emma you want to flip some numbers
okay so supposedly we still have four
bits
left from last time sure it feels right
um i personally feel like i should take
these bits
no actually not i taking these bits but
like the doctor like we should take the
bits the doctor i'm not too sure what
tamagotura
thinks but tamagotoro said 500 to keep
okay that's for me yeah that's what i'm
feeling so i'll yep
and then tamagoto also gave 500 the
players
with with the note because they're
destroying the world far more than ezra
which that's true not i think the wreck
i think those 500 that he gave
originally go to clive i think those are
clive's bits
hmm we'll send him aside maybe clyde
will use maybe clive will be nice enough
to give him to us
i mean if you if you ask for like we'll
probably give it to him
he'll probably okay so yeah what happens
we could we could use it on clive only
how about that yeah
yeah all right um
live our favorite our favorite twitch
user squirrel 500 to us as per usual
our favorite no this was a really
seven dollars yeah well i don't know how
much bits costs i don't
i think that's anyway i don't know um
and then jay matthews
um trader that he is a thousand to
ezra my second favorite twitch user and
i've played with that guy before come on
man
yeah there's a reason he's not giving
you bits whoa
is that the reason if you have to
explain a joke amy it's not
[Laughter]
uh so uh
it is now the evening the night of june
3rd
when last we left the great dane society
everybody
was split up uh
we had oh by the way king uh
who was the maroon
king just gave five subscriptions he
gifted five subs that's
awesome thank you i have to let my
subscription run out so i can get one of
these gift ones
i do that all the time it's great
um i i do it through prime
uh but thank you so much king uh
uh shakar no no the baroness is my
number one
favorite twitch user she's not there's
no second to the baroness
okay i mean yeah i think so oh she's
thomas is now asking me if i got all the
bits i don't know thomas recount coming

for your chance to win a nord games luck
deck
we also have a giveaway at the break
so hashtag chaos at the break i have
uh so
maybe this is relatable content for some
of you sometimes you kick-start
something
and then you forget about it and it
shows up and you're like
yep what is this and
as everyone knows i will use no
dice but birds of paradise but i did
kickstart

dice from company that i from
what was that what which company was it
again amy dice heartbeat dice
so i i kick-started these black lives
matter dice they come with
2d 20s one of the d20s has the the
raised fist the other has this the
symbol
blm and then a a bag of all the normal
dice
i don't know if there's any symbols on
there i know
but the d20s have it and we're gonna
be giving these away
uh because i want you to have a chance
to show at your table that black lives
matter every time you game
uh i can think of a few tables it
would have been awkward if i should i
would have loved to have shown up with
those and
had some awkward conversations with uh
some call from
some con gm's oh god maybe i should
keep these nope sorry uh
they are being given away so um
uh thank you all for the the bits
for the subscriptions
you're you're you're all fabulous idiots
it's it's wonderful
uh so yeah it is the night of june 3rd
uh professor lam has just been sedated
uh by dr hollister he assures me
that it was a limited dose of uh
uh and that she will be awake by the
morning he's just giving her the
sleep she needs
uh clive has passed out basically right
when he woke up
uh was woken up i should i'm gonna have
to watch him
because of his situation you know
heart attacks
oh yeah did we ever find out what
happens when you give someone
um i have consulted i have consulted a
physician
uh it's not great i'm not gonna lie it's
not great
like i said nothing good
when magic's involved you can't tell if
it's a heart attack pack or not so
i was just stopping whatever stimulus
was causing his reaction
i'll go back to him and do you want me
to do that now
well no 1920s doctors
um and so
the party has been like this is the
party split of all time
different cities no way of communicating
uh
uh there's a comedy of errors of going
back and forth and not being in places
you said that they said they were gonna
be in
it's it's it's fantastic as a gm it's
it's just fantastic i i couldn't be
happier
uh and so um
that night those of you still in
cairo
uh you are at a hotel
and emma you have
roused up a bunch of folks to get on a
boat and
well actually you're not sure how you're
going to transport them
you have you have some i thought i said
meet me there
oh yeah that's right yeah that's right
you just said
meet me in the burnt out hollow of da
sure it'll be fun
it's a true pilgrimage you you have to
have some risk in order to
attain the kingdom of heaven yeah yeah
i'm i'm
i'm not the person with the flag and
this in the microphone going and over to
the left
[Laughter]
uh yeah that would be a crappy walking
tour
and at the end we just need to slice
your arm a little
it'll be have an orange slice everything
will be fine
we have someone who's really good at
cutting don't ask too many questions
i don't have any orange slices though i
wasn't talking about you know
we bought we bought orange slices and
alcohol specifically for this event
alcohol for people who have just given
blood that's a great idea
uh so yeah it is it is the night of
june 3rd
in cairo you've been you have fled
an american military base that may or
may not still be having riots
um you were considering
uh going into old town cairo to
look for to look for a friendly
cat
uh are you gonna are you guys gonna do
anything
that night hey when do we need to leave
first time what's our good luck here i i
haven't noted in my notes that we have
to leave by tomorrow in order to get
there by the 5th
or 10th and give us that day to clear
things out
so it's about a half day down the nile
on the boat
and then it's about four hours from
doshur to
the pyramid but it's four hours that you
should really do at night
not not at the heat of the day yeah
that's gonna be fun
right
um yeah i i spent the the day keeping an
eye out for
for cats and periodically roaming just a
little ways into old cairo and
coming back out but you pointed out
rightfully so that cats are more
prolific at night so
are you so are you going into old cairo
alone
i see that look i'm getting no
okay i'm i'm crazy not suicidal
all right oh man look what i just
picked up
all right along with the black lives
matter dice
two of my birthday percentile dice from
the self-indulgent classics
oh my god they were sitting right here
so i'll just put those
right on top of the black lives matter
guys there we go
it's a it's a it's a random dice set
for all in sundry there are my birds of
paradise that's what i was looking for
so for us has it been three days since
we've seen them is that the situation
right now
uh yeah you went to the well no
so yeah you went to the yesterday you
went to the sphinx
or it was destroyed and
you yeah we we left the sphinx on the
30th
so it's been quite a while didn't we
okay
well i mean you you weren't you weren't
here for that but donald donald and i
left the the sphinx on the 30th 31st you
were doing your
preaching thing and then the first we
did the delivery into
old cairo that went poorly
i mean how many have been since we've
seen the other two from the party that's
what i'm saying
it's been the 30th so it'll be 31st
first second today's the third
so four days tomorrow will be five yeah
i'm assuming that they're
i mean they know where we're going and
they know when they have to be there so
yeah
the best the best that we can do is hope
that they are able to get themselves
there since they
weren't at the sphinx anymore we've had
no communication to rogers at all no
messages
nothing no one's made it to the hotel
you sent him a telegram
to the base and you said we're in a
hotel in cairo come find us
all right should be easy he knows that
he knows our fake names there aren't
you know this this might be the time
where dr hollister tells you where you
i'm fine not knowing that anyway yeah i
i i i i never go very far
into old cairo when i do when i when i
do range and it's
like a couple streets in and then come
right back out just watching for
um cats so yeah during the day you don't
really see
yeah i didn't think so much of anything
nobody looks
to look there's nothing for us to go at
this point
15. okay so at one point
you do see a cat and it like arches its
back
all right so i'm gonna like pause when i
when i see that and just like rock back
on my heels and go
i don't think we're going to be getting
well all right so
knowing that then if we're back at the
at the hotel
i'm gonna tell the other two um
i spotted a cat while we were out
ranging
and it it hissed at me
and i strongly suspect that was a
message from neris that
uh i'm sure she appreciated the 500
of milk but right it's an old cairo
i guess i get it so one cat kisses at
you and that means the all the work
we've done
is meaningless yeah
when you get the gm you know yeah
sometimes when
sometimes a cat's just a cat sometimes a
cat's just a cat
but you could have surprised the cat or
something maybe you're
stepping on its food i wasn't anywhere
near it you saw where i was in relation
to it
um basic based on that i'm going to
suspect
that we are not going to get any help
from narrows and that being the case we
need to find
a way to bribe our way onto a barge
possibly heading down in that direction
all right the plan b we just rent a
barge shouldn't be picked up it's just
three of us that that is that is a
workable plan
for sure yeah we do have some cargo to
carry as well
not a lot we have the food we have all
the bag of oranges that the females
purchased for us
uh the wine bottles of course emma's
purchase
the drum so i don't know who's playing
the drum you could offer the 14 people a
ride
well and and forever taking a boat i
suspect that will be more mentally
palatable for the people that we are
taking with us than
whatever the teleportation was going to
be
that was what jon was working on right
some sort of spell to
to travel and whatnot oh probably but we
haven't talked to them in four days i
i we can only hope that they're actually
at joshua but we cannot count on them
for anything except possibly being there
uh this plan
that we don't have their help if they
happen to help us that'd be great but
all right we'll get a barge we'll move
our things we'll arrive
on time we'll leave tomorrow morning
tomorrow morning yeah and
uh we should figure out a way that we
are
below decks so that we are not uh
visible to people who don't particularly
care for white people at the moment
all right yes and a larger barge good
all right fine i don't know what else we
can do this evening anything else we
need to do
well we're all kitted out for camping
for a couple of days we have the food
don't do anything are you bringing are
you are you going to invite
fine you should you guys want to bring
them i mean
they're just they're just another risk
i mean every time we're on a boat
something happens
fish people where the alligator people
attack that one
that too alligator people fish people
weird blob baby thing yeah we'd probably
have to entertain them or
talk to them or something on the boats
which could get a little odd and ask
questions
but they they they are a risk that we
need we need them we need that innocent
blood or this isn't happening
but we also have to keep them alive yep
what are the chances you think the uh
duchess will be on the
boat oh i hope she's there
well then we've got entertainment right
we have dinner at a show going on at
uh all right so it sounds like you're
gonna have an early night of it to get
ready for
what um
does emma go and talk to the people
because yeah i can
just go to the priest put up like
put up something outside the usually
in front of the church there's like a
glass case with
information yeah they have a
yeah he has a he he will send to the
to the volunteers he'll send he'll make
sure they know
um he has you know he can he can get
neighborhood children to run out
and head there
um make sure make sure that they visited
confession taking communion
you know the stuff yeah he he gave them
all confession you you
you told him to do that so
um make them innocent if they just do
the confession
for a certain value of innocent is that
all we need to do
i don't you have to believe it yeah
i don't believe it yeah how long has it
been since your last confession donald
how many murders that's your last
confession
i was going to say darling i was raised
i'm catholic too technically
i haven't been to a confession since i
was 14. i don't think it would work
that's supposed to work that's what they
teach us there's a lot of hail mary's
and what that will have to do
i we do not have that kind of time well
we got a few hours here
we do not have that kind of time for how
much death has happened between 14
and 27. well father i i i was there when
the world ended
i did not directly do it but i was there
and my child it'll be that'll be ten
hail marys
ten hail marys and please look look
graciously on the collection plate won't
you
there it is sure so yeah
i i imagine we're spending the evening
getting that sorted out
uh making sure that our people are good
to go
and getting an early night's rest i
guess okay
um all right so yeah it is the morning
of the fourth
joan you wake up you have a little
bit of a headache
but other than that you feel pretty
good um
and dr hollister you got some sleep
during the night but you were
um you were being a doctor and you know
making sure that no one died
um clive about four in the morning
started to like twitch in his sleep
and started to talk in his sleep
and he was just like saying something
against better judgment i would have
leaned in all right
um you hear him saying
over and over i'm a survivor
okay yeah i'll all i'll actually uh
more or less repeat that back to him
i'll try and be soothing about it but
it's it's you know in case you
hear me like reinforce that yeah
no i'm a survivor yeah clive you're a
survivor
you're a survivor i'm a survivor you're
a survivor
stop using magic that way you're a
survivor
um agatha
uh sits up and
that would imply she stopped what's
going on
uh so she she had when she was
just writing the black pharaoh is coming
and then she'd stopped
but and so she sits up and she's
writing again yeah oh uh
yeah i definitely did not get much sleep
yeah yeah what should be writing
uh she's just writing please kill
me
ah
sorry
that's something i can't help her with
yeah she so she's just saying that over
uh so yeah joan you wake up
no problem what time do i wake up you
wake up about
8 30. all right you feel very well
rested
and i wow whatever
polly did that was that was that was
pretty awesome but we
we still we're still running out of time
we need to get to sure on time
so so just to your your timeline
tomorrow clive is going to do
something awful to cleanse the pyramids
uh and then the day and then the next
okay so i am i get so i wake up i feel
fine but i i
still a little disoriented but but we
said we do we did make it to mcdarshire
okay
but we still need to do the cleansing we
still need to do okay all right
all right i'm ready i'm ready so i come
out
into the main room people are asking for
a picture of the black lives matter dice
i don't have a picture
uh but here are the 2d 20s let's see if
i can
so one second back up a little bit
so one has the clinched fist icon and
the other just says black lives matter
those are both the 20s and then it is a
set
of black dice of the other dice
are normal it's very nice and i'm
gonna
since i found them on my desk i'm also
gonna throw in
two spare dice from
this is the oh the 10th annual so this
was from my 10th annual birthday golf
tournament
from the 10th annual self-indulgent
classic
so the tens of each die uh
have the date on it i'll throw those in
the bag as well
great it's the the black lives
matter dice
are from heartbeat dice they're they're
really pretty they're very
nice i don't roll d20s so
[Music]
uh that's that's my rule for a game if
it has d20 unless d20s are like damage
or sanity loss or something i'm not
gonna
um so yeah it is you
you feel refreshed you feel very good
um clive
uh is still kind of with his head down
on the table
but you notice joan that he's also
like muttering something under his
breath
oh yeah no i'm gonna i'm i see him there
i'm gonna come over
all right and he's just whispering
i'm a survivor
i'm a survivor yeah we're survivors
we're survivors
oh i'm gonna put my hand on his shoulder
okay but not gonna shake it so as soon
as you put your hand on your shoulder he
sits up
good morning what day is it
so i haven't traveled through time
again well you did go pretty fast
right so we did we both went pretty fast
and we
so i'm supposed to go to the pyramid and
cleanse it of evil right
yes okay i'm just gonna need agatha for
that
okay what about us oh well
i don't think you're gonna want to be
there why not
i mean you're welcome to if you want i
want to see the evil be pushed away
well you know i don't know if you've
ever heard the old phrase fighting fire
with fire
it's sort of what's going on here
so you're bringing in champions to push
out the bad guys
well no i was being
somewhat literal about the fire i'm
gonna summon
these beings that are mostly fire
that hopefully because i can bind them
they're gonna hopefully go around and
get rid of any sort of
trouble around the pyramid that we need
to get rid of
yeah i'm used to having seeing fire get
rid of things that
are that we don't want to have around
so
i gotta talk i gotta talk to the doctor
i gotta talk to the doctor and see if uh
if we could go with it
look i'm gonna i'm gonna level with you
you're gonna see things if you travel
with me
that you might not wanna see
i've already seen so many things i've
already seen a whole bunch of things i
didn't want to see i need to see this
through
is what i see all right this is what i
need is to see this through
yourself i'm gonna go check on agatha
make sure she's doing all right
uh both you lamb and hollister
both make me luck rolls
okay
yes oh you both made it all right
hmm
we're lucky because we don't notice
something's wrong
yeah what is this something that didn't
happen or we didn't notice that it
happened
but i do find him that means i find him
though yeah yeah yeah
so you're in a warehouse essentially and
the front room
is a big open warehouse area that's
where
uh the five five i think it's five
the five uh
thugs agatha and
and then you two are in the on the
smaller back
so holly clive says that he needs to
go
soon and start getting rid of the evil i
think we should go with him
well we we still have to do the gate
we have to do the gate and get our
companions and get the blood sacrifices
like we can't do the ritual without it
we do need them but we need to also
clean everything yeah but if it's
cleaned it doesn't matter if if we don't
have if we can't do the ritual but we
can't do the ritual we have to
so how are we going to get how are we
going to get our guys how are we going
to get our people
we don't know where they are we we got
up we got a cultist yesterday
he's tied up right
we're going to use him to make a spider
to make a gate back to the military base
but they're not there i told him to be
there this morning
i left a message i took were you you
were gone yesterday never mind
um don't worry i'm on this okay all
right
all right uh
what time is it is it around the time to
do the because i gave him
time yeah so clive clive will actually
knock on the door
and he'll say do you want to be there
when i make the spider
oh no right okay then come out in
about
10 minutes and please ignore any screams
so he will he will head up front and
um you do not hear any screams
and about 10 minutes later he knocked it
so
about 10 minutes later he knocks on the
door
and he says uh so
what is it in the back of the truck
again what oh yeah the spider's in
the back of the truck
okay but i could bring him in here if
you want oh no i can do it in the truck
all right well bob's your uncle
go holly all right i'll go get the
others
okay so you step into the portal
and you are on that military base again
behind a building
oh oh yeah i'll look around really
quick
to see either around a different corner
maybe they got
maybe they're just a little they're
confused
huh no you don't uh
is there still a commotion towards the
gate it seems quieter
okay i'll head towards the gate okay and
i'll
i'll show my id and ask if if
six or seven days ago with the group and
if they've
they had instructions to return and if
if
anyone's arrived recently that matches
their descriptions
uh no sir but uh
you were with the the the
the folks from dc right
yes i think the ceo has a message for
you

as quickly as possible with all this
stuff
okay yeah you do and um
it the spider like dissolves as
um professor leone
wait hold on professor lam as soon as
hollister steps through the spider um
uh clive looks at me says
what are we looking for this time what
you what are we doing i gotta have a
plan i gotta have a plan we don't have
that much time
you're just reading the book right
book
you froze in like an amazing time i
thought wow professor lamb is really
thinking about that
that was weird it was like no that's
that's what happens when you mess with
time magic it's yeah
and you're starting to lose time yeah
that's right um
all right so i did not hear what you
said you said you said
do you want to go again and i said we
need some time and then
yeah and you were looking for rituals in
the book right yes yes
study the book let's do it okay okay
uh he will he'll come up to you and
he just taps your forehead
and you are zipping through the book
again um
and you have pay no attention to
anything else
going on around you um
so hollister you were at the base for
about a total of an
hour okay and you will
uh you'll you'll come out of the
portal
oh yeah what where who just right
outside the it sounds like right outside
the truck
okay yeah
i look out all right you look out
upon
a horrific scene as clive has
torn the f the five thugs
uh apart and he has built
he has painted in blood an eight-sided
star
on the floor and in the
at each point of the star
um is a hand
of one of the dead well you hope of
one of the dead people
uh and in the center of the star
is agatha's head and agatha's eyes are
and clive clive is like kneeling in
front of her listening to her
no what have you done yeah make me a
sand roll that's a
wow i'm glad i'm in another room
idiot we needed them all right
you're surprisingly okay with this you
lose one sanity i'm not a
with this we needed them we actually
what do you need no we didn't what do
you we don't we don't have we don't have
we don't have any blood for the ritual
we we we don't go forward with it if we
don't have the blood they weren't there
no one was there
we need to find people look you seem a
no we're not fine it doesn't matter if
we clear the area if we can't do the
ritual
there's no point to it look here's the
good news
do you want me to tell you what you want
i'll i'll just tell you it's fine uh
i've i've finally got her to stop
talking my goodness she can go on
so agatha assures me that your friends
are on the way here via boat with a
boat full of innocent souls in that
wonderful news
can't you tell if they're gonna actually
make it well she hasn't gotten that far
yet
well i mean we still we we it's not a
sure thing
well nothing ever is
okay that actually makes sense okay yeah
but like we
we this is this is this is beyond life
or death this is
careful don't step on that hand okay
yeah i watch where i'm i'm stepping i i
am watching where i'm stepping
uh i mean we still we still need to we
oh we needed them oh why
why why why why i'm gonna i'm just
agatha was dead right
she stopped seeing the future right so
what i
did was i resurrected her
i mean yes it cost her her body and
of course the other five gentlemen had
to have some unfortunate bits taken from
them as well
could have waited for us to look for
cultists
we could have i don't
look who has that kind of time time is a
valuable resource
we
i mean it's it's done it's done crap
crap i'm gonna walk away i'm gonna walk
whatever cultists you can find i'm gonna
use tomorrow as bait
no we we needed we need to be able to go
out safely and
and look for people who who would
participate in the ritual
like having guards
i mean i brought back i brought back
guns guns are not gonna do
anything here against cultists they will
we're not gonna look mate you're not
gonna be running into cultists
the army the black pharaoh is
principally
a myth no no we've seen him
it's mainly oh no no the black pharaoh
is not a myth let's be clear the black
pharaoh is real as you and me
but the army of the black pharaoh is not
some national insurgency
popping up all over egypt no no
obviously
these are the children of the black
pharaoh
are these burrowing creatures
worms no those are the dholes oh
the dolls you know dolls are kind of um
they're really neither good nor bad they
just sort of are
make a lot of tunnels and that sort of
thing um
really don't recognize us as kind of
anything sort of um
you know either too stupid to know where
anything are too smart to know or
anything can't
not sure which never tried talking to
one not much of a conversationalist they
are
but these children of the blake pharaoh
they use those tunnels
and i can travel through the sand and
they can come out
through hieroglyphics they're attuned
and that's the real army of the black
pharaoh that's what's doing the damage
i mean we it still would have been
better to have gotten cultists and have
had these men alive i'm just saying you
could have waited an hour and consulted
me
well you know what's done is done and
uh you should check on professor lim
yeah uh
i'll leave the rifles in the car but
grab one of the crates of food and water
okay and bring it in professor lam is
sitting
i'll call out into and uh
declive how long is she going to be like
this
who agatha well i mean it's no hotel
professor lamb
oh well i put her in for three this
time
god damn it oh i mean
look it's it it's she needs to finish
that book and get
if you don't know how to bind the damn
things all you can do is have them
show up and then they're no good to
anybody
could have taken a 10 minute break
whatever i'm closing the door
i know agatha they just seem really
ungrateful
can i interrupt for some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh
we've got the typical
ingrates that we usually are so elder
brat
gave us 500 for the first fumble uh
i'm using the dice yep that could go
either way
and then a new bits giver i'm sure
i'm going to slaughter this
maddie iso-ism m-a-d-d-y iso
sm everybody take a stab yep
500 bits i've just yeah 500 bits so
i'm taking it
thank you so much maddie that's awesome
uh maddie said some very nice things
about the stream
in the which makes me think she
hasn't watched before
they until they until otherwise
determined
uh so back in cairo it is
the morning of the fourth and
you are able to get a large
barge that can hold many
uh that can easily hold you and
your whole crew
uh when do you tell them you wish to
leave
at like seven or eight in the morning
sometime early
so tomorrow early tomorrow morning yeah
okay
uh and with an enormous thermos of
nice maddie says she listens to the
podcast tiana tiana

podcasts together so that's awesome i
i am delighted that you listened to uh
what we put out

for that that's
uh so yeah you um
you set this up and he'll be ready

newspaper
is talking about the ministry
uh the ministry of state is once again
saying that the pyramids of giza
have been liberated egypt's
birthright
is once again the belongs to the
state
uh and regrettably
you know the the the those horrible
terrorists
the army of the black pharaoh have uh
had they they they destroyed the sphinx
and that is you know they're they're
trying to undersell that but it's hard
um and there's pictures of
uh the wreckage of the sphinx in the
newspaper
and we noticed from the photos of the
sphinx isn't where it used to be
yeah does anybody have that issue yeah
you guys can totally yeah
that it is clearly not where it started
yeah
so we were we were looking to get a
barge for today
to leave the morning of the fourth if i
understood correctly
oh so okay so you're getting out there
early
yeah yeah okay doesn't it take us until
like
that so it's like a half day trip yeah
okay
but but but because we know that we that
the the place needs to be cleared on the
fifth we want to be there to assist with
that as much as possible
and be ready for the sixth
i mean no i don't actually want to be
involved
so yeah you you will yeah you'll get
the boat for right away
um about uh
just one or both romeo admit roll me up
roll me both percentile dice let's see
what you get
um oh 56 straight down the middle
so almo so most of the folks that you
uh that you asked to come that
volunteered showed up so there's about a
dozen people
okay who show up kind of confused and
they're like
uh then they see you and they're like oh
oh
um we're here for the pilgrimage okay
all right let's get on board they'll be
um
um all right um
make me uh
oh no 91 anybody get a hard success
i got i i just barely got a hard success
all right um
so most
so most of these dozen people are really
like
wrapped up and could be anybody and
you're sort of aware
of like how many people hate you
and who could be sneaking into this sort
of thing
yeah i'm keeping a very close eye on on
everyone and
my hand is never very far from one of
the spots where i hide daggers
okay yeah the people are
are you know you're you're putting them
below decks right
yeah we all are okay we're all below
decks so they all kind of just go down
there and then you
you start passing out food and coffee
and they're a little happier but
they're mainly just talking to each
other in arabic
which none of us speak fantastic
i'm i'm cool with that so yeah once
and we'll haul in like our gear and
stuff and all right
emma do any of them speak english they
all do don't they
10 feet out of the dock when you hear
bathroom a boat a boat
is leaving keep it moving isn't that
that's the boat the church said we were
you've got to be kidding me i've totally
turned this boat around for this boat of
a woman
uh are you are you getting killed in a
sense
um so you on deck you will see
stupid debate that indeed the the
duchess is
is standing there but what you
standing next to her is tidwell and he's
like
she knows us right oh well
uh we've run into her a few times
whether or not she remembers us
is entirely a different issue i mean
she's with
she's she's been with tidwell this whole
uh so are you're turning the boat around
of course we are oh i i i know
i just want to hear her whinging in the
desert that's that's what i'm here for
finally you know
i don't know why that nice priest told
me
that i needed to come on this boat but
he said that it was a pilgrimage
emma how badly did you piss off that
priest
i don't know all i know is that she's
probably got enough blood for like the
entire sacrifice
well she's she's she's too stupid to be
anything but innocent
so yeah
she gets on the board on the boat oh
where is my
cabin oh darling it's a it's it's
envelope it's a pilgrimage that means uh
self-sacrifice
and no cabins
no cabins self-sacrifice that's part of
a pilgrimage
well find me a space to sit
i will not go below decks so
uh tidwell like her a chase lounge out
of like
rope and like stuff on the deck and like
much of your food and water and then she
just
as long as she doesn't crush the food or
the water
[Laughter]
bertram my parasol
he stands above her with like a tiny
little umbrella
i'm so sorry mr tidwell
the man's chooses to be here
and i'm just gonna like shake my head
and go back below decks because it's
the sun is starting to come up and i'm
like it's not warm yet it will be
uh tidwell remains implacable
standing there with the sun beating down
on him
uh holding the tiny umbrella over the
duchess
shoot who also gets 500 bits from
tabagatora of course she doesn't matter
of course she freaking does is that for
us or is that for ezra for the duchess
for the duchess yeah oh i've got one the
duchess has got one
so you have an uneventful trip down
uh down it's entertaining for sure
um the duh yeah the duchess is just
it has her laurnier out and she's like
oh
yeah i'll i'll periodically come come
above decks well not come above just
like
leave her alone it's it's too much
fun poking her with a stick
tidwell let me have my entertainment
poor tidwell is sweating profusely as he
holds the tiny umbrella
um you reached usher about
with the turnaround you get there about
one o'clock in the afternoon
uh i think in japan maybe no you know
what you never have
uh yeah hard success all right you hear
the most god-awful noise you have
ever heard as um
uh it sounds like a human voice
very distant very faint um
uh it sounds like it's it's telling
someone to not
touch them is
is jones still under joan will have
come out by now so joan has come out
uh joan you now know the ritual bind
dole oh okay and i made sure to have and
some food ready for her and joan
yes that ritual cost
wow
i'm gonna give her another phobia let's
you come out of this um
and you are convinced that
um like you feel
your body decaying you
feel like your organs somehow like
expanding in uh
um you know as time dilation
has some sort of impact on them and you
feel
um for the rest of your days however
long they may be
you're like acutely aware that like
your body is not well so you're
essentially now a hypochondriac
like everything is making you everything
makes you feel like you've just died a
little
isn't that true for everyone i mean
well i have to eat the best foods i have
to have the best foods and i have to
drink lots
and lots and lots of water oh no you can
holly you just gotta help me you've just
gotta help
just stop using that spell and and
we can't we can't that spell is
everything
have you learned the ritual you need to
learn yes
well now you can just learn things in
regular time
eat oh it's very hard once you've
once you've experienced time dilation
it actually becomes harder to read in
regular time
because it feels so slow
just eat your food well yeah it feels so
slow but also
i don't often have 12 hours straight
that i can focus on something like that
and with time dilation i can easily
spend 12 15
hours see how many straight
and then see holly that is that is not
good for you that's not good for your
body
running out of time well it doesn't
disagree i guess i mean i'm a doctor
yeah yeah see and we're running out of
time we're running out of time i need
all the time that i can get
it's just the point you're killing
yourself faster
if we do the word world dies i'm gonna
die anyway
right you know it's a great point
there's no tomorrow might as well live
like it yeah
yeah just agatha no we're planning to no
no the whole point
is that there will be a tomorrow that's
that's the that's the entire point of
everything we're doing
well that's a fair point i mean agatha
is actually telling us about what's
going to happen tomorrow
so there is a tomorrow what did she say
what did she say
well here's the interesting part so
apparently the cleansing of evil goes
very well okay although
she does mention that some of you get a
little closer than you really need to
and some poor some unfortunate things
happen there
she kind of glossed over that part um
between you and me she's a little bit uh
you know she's a little bit of a um
she's old-fashioned she doesn't like to
give people bad news
but we need all the news we need all the
news now well i mean you can ask her
okay oh no
all right you're listening just as a
heads up before you go i'll put my hand
on your shoulder to stop you if you're
getting up
is missing her body so brace yourself
for that
just a massacre occurred in that room
what what how wait wait a massacre who
wait okay well not just me
it's not just me it's a ritual blood
ritual it's a deal it's a life-saving
blood ritual
look we all know blood magic is the most
effective magic
all right all right all right all right
i'm stealing myself i'm stealing myself
because we don't have enough time to
deal with this crap let's go
i'm not gonna lie the hands are starting
to get pretty ripe
let's why was the plural let's go
holly aren't you don't you want to know
don't you want to know
no i've already been in that room i i am
going i'm
going i'm going i'm going i'm going i'm
going
all right yeah you come out
and the room is covered in blood um
i heard i hurl everything i've just
eaten on the uh
on the floor is an eight-sided star
painted in blood
with a severed hand at each point of the
star
uh and in the center of the star is
agatha's
conscious head all right after i hurl
i steal myself because we have to do
this to save the world
okay
a sand roll yeah you knew what you were
getting yourself into don't even
yeah not even not even
um you lose three sanity but
you have this weird moment of like
um you know so so right now you're
acutely aware of your body dying
yes like you can feel it and you know
you come out and you're like
in in in a way that shows that you are
not well you go
well i'm not a head sitting in the
middle of an eight-pointed blood star
so yeah yeah yep so i'm
i'm doing okay gives you some
perspective yeah
yeah i'm not ahead sitting in the middle
of
my hands sticking up that's a great
point
um but i want to talk to her
so clive standing next to you goes
marvelous isn't it
yes the vision came to me
in a dream of this this ritual i didn't
actually know
what it would do it just i was like what
can i do for poor agatha because you
know she was on her whole kill me won't
you kill me
face and that and i'm already dead and
you know it was a little tiresome i'm
not gonna lie and it sounds like they
i don't right whoever gave you that idea
i don't care who they are they gave you
the idea right
i heard you really think about who gave
me the idea
right it was your dream a little
troubling and that not
i mean who
is what if what if we're just all being
manipulated through this whole thing
and some sort of horrible thing is
guiding us to do unspeakable things
well that'd be something wouldn't it
just
now thinking of that clan i thought
okay let me hear what she has to say
she's always told us the truth
wait sure yeah okay igather
uh professor lam here would like to know
what exactly is gonna happen when i do
the whole cleansing evil bit
um i'm trying to remember if agatha ever
spoke
i bet i would take a cloth and put it
around that because i'm going oh crap oh
crap there's all sorts of things around
here i don't know
um agatha will um
in a in a very breathy voice agatha
will relay that you know uh
clive is able to summon
um and she says several different
names of creatures that you could make
cthulhu meet those roles on if you want
um
yeah my sanity is pretty low i might do
it
um and she says
he summons them he's able to bind them
uh not all of the innocents
uh it is not only it it is not only evil
so not all the innocent sir why wouldn't
well i i i hope i've made it clear i
really tried to make it clear
that we go
this is a little bit like fishing with
dynamite what we're doing here
you know i mean cleansing evil yeah
but really it's more just sort of
so you know when i when i
summon all of these things
it's not really there's not a lot of
discernment
you know it's not like you can detect
good and evil that's ridiculous
okay so so so basically none of us
should go there except you
and i get the right oh i don't
look if agatha leaves that circle she's
caught dead
okay okay okay i mean i can figure
anyone who can get kicks agatha up by
her hair
and like blood a little blood drips out
of the dripping neck and he's like hello
agatha
no but but if she leaves this circle
you know it's it's curtains for her
okay okay okay sorry about that we'll
so there's some maybe there's some
people in the area that's gonna that are
gonna get that are gonna get beat up by
this okay i can deal with that if
there's some people who are already
there
who are gonna get beat up by this but we
have to close this off before the
biggest evil comes out
i'm ready but i'm not gonna go
there's a double meaning to that yes uh
i think i mean as far as i'm concerned
all i've heard agatha say is that
everything's going to be great
all right i'm going to get out of this
room because there's too much here that
that oh i could get
ooh ooh things can get me i i don't want
to die before this is done
maybe after but not now not yet you're
the one that vomited
well yeah because it's it's disgusting
there's so many things here that could
infect
i can't okay i gotta move i gotta get
nothing because now someone's vomited
in the corner you on the tire of a trump
the truck
how can we if i drive that truck out of
here now it's gonna
track for me everywhere that's
disgusting
really you should have some respect for
your environment
says the man who's put blood everywhere
i stomped out of the room i just stopped
no such thing as vomit magic i can't
it's ridiculous ha ha
i'll figure it out so did i hear that
voice while they were having that
exchange
yes all right i'll go out and i'll peek
on
what's happening wrap myself up so i'm
semi disguised
uh okay you see make me a spot
hidden roll
oh okay yeah hard success
all right so you clearly see on a roof
of so you know
sure is mostly kind of burnt out hulks
and and
and ruined buildings there are a couple
of complete buildings this is one of
them
um you very clearly see it's it's
high afternoon silhouettes
that are are you know the sun is sort of
making them only silhouettes
but there are some people in in what you
dressed like you've seen cultists that
are on the roof
but i can't see what's making now the
the
the the rubble of buildings and that
building are blocking the harbor
oh god i'm gonna try to
discretely
but not obviously not too discreetly
try to walk to a place where i can get a
view because the voices i heard the
voice i heard was in english right
yes okay i'm gonna just
act like i'm someone like peeking
their head out to see what that voice is
uh just acting natural just like anyone
else
are you trying to see the people on the
roof are you trying to get down to the
harbor
oh i can see the people on the roof but
the people on the roof are looking at
the people at the harbor right
well they're looking at the harbor yeah
i'm going to try and
find a place where i can see both
but if i can't i'm more interested in
the seeing what's happening at the
harbor and then moving back to where i
was where i could see them on the roof
so the boat pulls up to
the dock and uh
the and the captain of the boat
says you know uh
he he goes we have arrived and he like
he says
uh pretty lady need help off the boat
and he like
grabs the duchess that just don't touch
me
and she starts having a conniption
about the the guy trying to
who just wants to get her off the boat
to and he'll like back away very
quickly and then he goes
to emma he's like all right we're
here get off quickly i want to get out
of here before the shooting starts
what shooting i'm just assuming there's
going to be shooting i saw how many guns
you brought
okay all right
i'm already up on the deck and just like
scanning looking around to see
what's waiting for us at dashur because
i mean i'm more melee than
than ranged but i'd like to know what
i'm walking into
so joshua is mostly rubble
there are here and there but buildings
that seem to have been
not destroyed but most of the buildings
are burnt out husks
um there are uh
um you don't see any people around
mm-hmm
is there something at the docks when we
get like where i can just
kind of usher the group to some place
that's not in the sun like
you know like maybe a burnt up building
or something that has some cover to it
uh once you get off the dock but um
before that happens
success hard success 56 i forgot i'm
[Music]
that's sanity all right
um so as emma starts to try and get
people off the boat
and you're all sort of moving around
there is a
blam there's a rifle shot and emma you
just got
shot for do i really not have a
where's my d8 he's not shot for seven
and so as we cut to break
um you're all on deck getting things
ready trying to get people off
and dr hollister you see
one of the people on the roof like
aiming a rifle
and then you hear blam and
you take seven points of damage so
uh that's gonna take us to break we are
doing once again a giveaway
of these really nice ice cream dice
black lives matter dice heartbeat dies
heartbeat i think i'd remember the name
of the darn company
uh it's a a full set of uh
two weirdly 2d 20s and then a a full set
of dice
sometimes you got a roll advantage or
disadvantage in the d20 systems
you know it would be even weirder if it
was like 3d 12 or something
yeah that'd be fun yeah and and so
uh it'll be hashtag chaos now to be
entered to win that
uh and we will be back just as soon as
[Music]






emma has been shot, we and we are gonna
go into initiatives. there's a
ready rifle so that's gonna have plus 50 to its
initiative,
nobody else had a weapon readied. another shot rings out
part of the
barge
goes
Donal
runs down below where his equipment
is okay you'll get to your gun this round
because it's never far
you like run to the bag the people
that haven't been getting shepherded up
are
hunkered down trying to figure out
what's going on
yeah so i'm getting a rifle
out getting that ready as quickly as all
right yeah heading right back up when
i'm running
alexandra can i see where that
came from
yeah you saw a muzzle flash
up on a roof
two streets 
are we close enough to the dock that i
can get onto the dock
sure i'm gonna just
like immediately swing down
over the rail and just take off running
using it using cover from the buildings
as much as i can to not have any direct
line of fire
on me and so part of the problem with
that
is that you know docks are by their
nature
very open so you know for this round
you'll be open next round you'll be in
the street
and so you'll probably have more cover
yeah yeah so my my plan is to get to
them as quickly as i can using as much
cover as i can but i imagine yeah
this this round i'm just entirely on the
docks and keeping low and moving fast
yeah and and you would know you also
would see they're on the roof of a
building yep okay
wow i'm 60 but i i
oh yeah hard success all right you heard
a gunshot for sure
you heard a gunshot outside and you will
you know you
you were just coming back into the back
room the back room
is empty and um
hollister like the door there's like a
back door and that door is open
okay that's that is that's where i think
holly went i mean
yeah yeah in a world where portal
jumping spiders exist
okay i i i i'm not super good at guns
but i'm gonna
try to find one you remember that
there are rifles in the front
um that got him
vomited yes i'm going i'm going back
there right
right back around and climbs like oh
good you're gonna clean it up
no there's a shot there's rifles there's
people out there shooting
oh should i summon something not yet not
yet let's see if we can shoot him
i'm getting a gun all right yeah they're
right there they're over there
okay that's that's that's mine right i
um no that's why i use daggers obviously
uh on a
on a on a 50 the duchess
will um
will make her way up out of her
makeshift chase lounge
and will turn to tidwell
is there a welcoming party get me some
and tidwell has once again not
reacted
as is his as is his his want um
and all right that was 50s
40s yep so
i'm you know that's seven that's a lot
of that there's a lot
seven is no fun if i can i'm
gonna try
and limp or whatever my way to get
everybody off the boat
all right so um
like i'm just yelling take cover in the
in the city
all right yes they will
people will start to so the people that
everybody was
starting to come out of the thing
um seeing an angry man pulling a rifle
out of a bag made them stop going
upstairs but now as you're yelling
that they'll be like oh okay okay
i'm like go go go go
okay and so they will start to
they will start to to leave and dr
hollister
uh first
okay first question did i manage to find
a place where i could both see the
cultists that were shooting and the
can i still see the cultists you can see
the cultists you haven't seen the harbor
yet
um because the gunshot interrupted your
your heading to a spot where you
could see both
okay can i find cover
where i can see the cultists sure yeah
okay
and then after doing that do i still
have time
uh that'll that'll be most of this round
you can read a weapon or something if
yeah
i'll all take out my revolver okay uh
yeah you pull out your revolver it's
gonna be a little far the
the range is to be tough with your
revolver
okay all right there you go uh
the rifle man
the duchess has plot armor and actually
ablative armor she is able to armor um
uh the one of the sailors goes down he
shot blam oh um
and that was 130 um
you dr hollister would see that one
cultist has
a rifle the other seems to be looking
through binoculars
at the boat or whatever's in the harbor
okay
uh and all right that was that
90s 80s donald trump
all right so assuming donald's ready you
know with the rifle right yep yeah you
can head back up
head up the stairs i want to use right
where the stairs meet the boat imagine
there's some structure there's a
wall but there's also like a bunch of
people who are trying to come up the
stairs because emma just told them to
leave
i'll do it i can't ignore them maybe
they'll actually be a distraction
for me will notice me perhaps these
people are running past me
well so the stairway is this is this is
you know a fairly narrow stairway so
um they will they will they're not gonna
you're you're a professional
um they're not gonna like make it so you
can't shoot
but they are gonna make you know you
will have a a penalty die on this role
uh well actually i'll give you i'm gonna
make you an offer
you can take a penalty die in this role
and not worry about these innocent
people
or you can you know not care if you know
they get a little too close
and and you know take some hearing
damage or who knows what other kind of
damage
um and you can just get a shot off with
i'll take the penalty die all right you
don't need all that alex
would not forgive me if i damaged some
of our precious
sacrifices
all right so a shot with a penalty die
all right so basically lining up leaning
against the wall a bit for cover
trying to now you could you could
aim and if you spend a turn if you spend
this turn aiming
then next round you'll you'll just have
a straight roll
i'll give a straight roll a shot first
i'll i will end this time
okay so i'm gonna i don't know where
alex is
now we're in a situation here so i'm
gonna i don't have a lot of time
so 21 and an 81 and 80 is a success
81 it but it's not a hard success right
no success okay
so you you line the shot up and you fire
um and it hits the it hits like the
uh they have cover essentially keep them
busy forming oh so i would eat a hard to
get these guys
okay i'll do what i can next turn all
right there you go but but um
mm-hmm
um all right that was 80s 70s
alexandra you're looking it up the
street yeah and and now i imagine i have
some cover from them shooting at me
they they seem to be ignoring you
fantastic i'm
i'm let's see they're up on a roof so i
don't want to draw a dagger yet but i
want to get as close to them as i can
and if i can get close enough i want to
start climbing that roof
okay sure next round hollister you
will see alexandra as she comes up the
hill towards that building i
doubt i'll be looking for her though
it's true
uh that was 70s also on a 70
donal you would swear
that you hear chanting uh
down here on the boat inside the boat
yeah
block [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay gotcha gotcha
um that was and professor lamb
yes all right i i i was smart enough i
believe to take a couple of firearms so
i'm going to go up to mr
where where dr hollister is and have a
couple of firearms
okay yeah you bring him a rifle as well
and i got a rifle
i'm not great but this is this is this
time
[Laughter]
you like come running up and he looks he
was
i don't know how to use her rifle i've
got my revolver out
okay whatever these are hard times i got
mine
i want i don't know how to use a rifle
to be the episode title
i like the other one better but this
that would be okay too
i had to try let's see
we're not trying to we're just trying to
make it so they need to find cover and
can't get easy shots at our guys yeah no
i tried to shoot at them i
i don't have a lot so i got a 36 out of
20 now
so they definitely notice and
one of them the guy with the
binoculars like turns around
and like looks kind of where you guys
are and they
they kind of try to hunker down they
with a small angry assassin closing
quickly well they they they
like i said they haven't seen yeah they
seem to be
focused on the people that are shooting
at them
uh all right that was 60s 50s emma
is next i'm 40. did somebody go before
me
uh nope you're you it's you then
hollister
you're down below where the chanting is
right no she's up on deck
i'm kind of like ushering people off has
everybody gotten off the boat yet
the the guy with the rifle has
definitely slowed the pace of people
coming up the stairs
okay i'm gonna still keep pushing i
cannot stress enough
these are totally normal people
who yeah you know are not used to the
things that you guys are used to
and so there's a lot of like step back
when he
when someone pulls out a gun you know
and then while they tell us
like a building or something that i can
just point them to be like get to that
building
yeah sure if they get if they can get
across the deck
the dock there's like a they can get a
flush against a wall
yep and i'm like get against that wall
and i just keep pushing people
like grab and push grab and push okay
uh dr hollister okay
yeah i'm i mean obviously i'm trying to
hit one of them
but it's more i'm trying to put lots of
bullets in their direction to make their
lives difficult
right okay i will i'll make you an
offer
okay so you because of the range you're
gonna have a penalty die on this shot
can i have two penalty dies yes
uh what so and that
you can just you can take this shot as
normal or
you can just sort of tier to to what you
were saying you can just
fire blindly kind of like blam blam blam
and get it
it's not blind but like so it's more
i love if some ricochets can happen
around them just to
make them like ah get their head down
and not make it as easy
so then then you just have the one the
one penalty die oh and i just found
another penalty dice
and that's for range all right that one
doesn't
oh no wait so well no because i'm
it's the range and i'm and i'm firing
multiple bullets oh sorry you're going
auto so yeah then you do have two
okay
and the first one wouldn't have oh my
god that one almost
that was close might have been surprised
this gun is weighted for throwing
oh and man oh that one was almost a
fumble
those are my three bullets so blam blam
blam you
you know you've definitely got their
attention now the more bullets have come
see see joan i know what i'm doing
so i'm gonna give a penalty die to the
to the rifle shot now
uh because of that alexander you see
the guy on the roof like turn around and
uh and he misses thanks to the penalty
die oh you know what i've got
inspiration i'm gonna use one of my
inspirations
all right does he have another penalty
dive from our cover
uh no he needs a hard success because we
recover okay
okay oh
oh birds of paradise andrea
uh so both of you make luck rolls
and whoever makes whoever misses the
luck roll
gets shot
[Music]
i make it okay who made it by worse
um i made it by five
oh gosh i made it by 20. all right so
no i made it worse oh yeah she yeah she
she i made it by 20. oh
made it oh i see made it by 20. all
right we were all
sitting here like wait what what oh i'm
almost gonna want to
burn inspiration on let's do it oh one
never mind i'm going all right all right
yeah you guys
you matrix your way
get it all right whoa makes it i was
ready for a hundred but no
make sure to make sure to check that
dodge box oh i did oh yes damn all right
um all right that that works just fine
yeah that is that is a dodge and a half
that's when i actually turn to tell
jones i know what i'm doing and as i
turn
so we go to donal i immediately spin and
look underneath the boat who's chanting
where's it coming from
all right yeah you see we're on we're
on 80s right
there is definitely one of the
passengers
at the very back end of the boat is
chanting
yeah he's he's dead i'll put a bullet on
his face
oh okay did you learn to just shoot
him basically
yeah wrong no penalty dice or anything
all right let's see all right the 59 is
a regular successor
yeah you just you just are like bam bam
um
and so
the bullet gets about this far from the
person
and then bursts into flames
burning his face and the light of the
bullet
lights up the face of don julio
he's got like scars now um
and he he finishes his chant
and everybody let's see
who would not make this role hollister
alexandra
no alexander would make it so only
hollister and lamb
do don't make me a power everybody else
oh no can i inspire this or not yeah
but it's terrible oh it's worse it's 87.
so
that's that's two amies but no emmas all
right
i made it sorry all right
so dr hollister and joan you see
a very weird thing as weirder than we've
see
oh yeah well yeah it gets weirder so the
guy with the rifle
is fine the guy that was with the
binoculars
flames this remind me of someone else
floating up in the air
sort of yeah we all saw that
which also gave the master exorcist 500
bits i don't even know
whose
only gives bits to like bit npcs
i feel like does this go into ezra's bit
pile or yeah
yeah yeah yeah really am
your creation amy but he's out of your
control now okay
yeah so so emma and donal
you both float into the air here we go
again
um let's see alexandra made the role
and one of the cultists made the role
you like feel warm
alexandra and the other the rifle
cultists also like you see him
he takes a beat as he's trying to figure
out what the heck is going on
yeah i i like stutter step for a second
before continuing
uh i'm just saying he probably got the
hey now he missed me hey amy
nick one of our chat people thought
you know what would be fun after you're
done with massive narrow thoughtep
i hear there's this horror on the orient
express
no i've heard i am not
going on the orient express we could
bring a briefcase case full of dynamite
with us
on the orient express and i don't think
that a flesh monster would come up over
the top rip the thing open and someone
in desperation would blow up the train i
don't think that that would happen
and then we'd never end up in what's now
like
modern day like what is it croatia or
whatever just
wandering in the snow from you know
skeletons floating down or
floating down a river in a barrel like a
barrel of monkeys everything's fine
i've said it before that i will never
have
a better ending to a campaign than that
oh
that was so great i was so mad at my
husband for killing me
boy that's a sentence
[Laughter]
ah that was that was just not all right
okay dr paramusium also gives us 500
against the crazy priest thank you
doctor oh
nice all right
so that was that was 80s 70s
alexandra
you get up to the building it
it looks like you have no idea i have no
idea what's happening
yeah she's she's focused on maybe you
see a little smoke up uh
and i felt i feel a little warm but also
like i'm under the egypt
sun i just dropped you warm it's true
and
and you just had cardio so just
sprinting
uh so you think it's going to be a tough
climb
up the side of uh
up the building but you could probably
do it or you could try and find your way
uh see if going inside gets you up to
am i able to say am i able to see where
they used to get up or would i guess
that it would be inside
you don't see any way they could have
gotten up out here
okay then i will take the climb because
they won't expect because i'm gonna be
aiming to come from behind where he's
facing at the moment and i don't think
he'll be expecting
any of that nonsense all right so
make me a climb roll
okay
[Music]
33 is that a hard success a regular
success
okay so you make it part of the way up
so i'm just
i just did an opposed role essentially
with the building's size
okay and it got a regular success
so you need a hard success
but you get you you've started climbing
up the building okay and i'm trying to
be kind of quiet so that you know all of
the gunshots going on around he doesn't
he doesn't hear me
yeah sure that's that's no problem all
right 7060 is professor lamb
yes i see a guy floating in the air on
fire
on the plus side he's a very easy shot
right now i think we can let him be
if he's on fire that's not who i want to
join is there anybody
else that i mean there's there i know
there's another guy shooting
yeah there's a rifle guy who's got
pretty good coverage all right i'm gonna
try
hard success yeah
tidwell made his power roll but yes that
is too good not to do
the duck just like float like there's a
for the guy to handle purge
lighter evil and then the interrogator's
just like oh
for a minute that took a lot out of me
you know this is you know this is bad
when joan takes a shotgun
and then and the duchess flies come on
you've got a rifle
you've got a right have a rifle not a
shotgun give yourself more okay fine
whatever so any kind of firearms
any kind of firearms i'm just usually
not yeah you got an l7 that is a great
shot was that a hard success
yes well so you're gonna do
uh rifle is 2d6
okay so go ahead and roll that don't
don't you get don't you get full
um damage oh yeah sorry hard success you
get a full you get full damage yeah
that's just well damaged so 12. it's 12.
this guy might be dead before i get to
him good
uh yeah the gunshots stop
uh oh does he do that what's the name of
that scream and then fall off he does
not do the
and fall off the side he does not oh
shoot but but if we sit in a point
of inspiration
but he
[Laughter]
um but but for this turn at least
the gunshots
have like the guy who was who was
shooting like he you definitely hear him
yelp
and then he is he is uh
he's keeping it he's keeping under
cover
i would know that sound it didn't
sound i mean there was no death rattle
cool okay you're i mean you're used to
stabbing death noises
yeah i've been hanging out with bottom
long enough i know what shooting sounds
like i'm shooting death sounds yeah and
it's just like wondering why you walk up
to the bodies and listen afterwards like
what are you hearing no you just
you just hear enough of them and just
you just figure it out
joan's doing she's doing a dance
though
are you doing the fortnite dances that's
old to really know what that is all
right emma
carlton the carlton is one of the
fortnite dances make me a power roll
again yes it's after you man
get the bits ready still no all right
you take four points of damage from
burning
before i we started this i was
like scream for forgiveness or whatever
all right so you asking for forgiveness
um so maybe start praying or something
yeah so okay if you took confession
then you're gonna have a bonus die on
all the rest of your pow
rolls okay so from now on so you don't
take any damage
but you are still floating and there are
flames around you
um and it looks like maybe it's not you
maybe it's someone else but it looks
like the
but the boat is starting to uh
deal with some flames evil
the boat's evil or you know donald was
below deck when he started floating
yeah and burst into flames
yeah i'm gonna shoot at the the floating
guy yes
he's an easy shot no so you don't even
have a penalty die
with your revolver because
you know it's the fairy fire syndrome
i am always impressed when you know d
and something d and d
yes just do a regular i was
literally playing d and d before you
were born
[Laughter]
i'm a baby at this table i'm aware of
this what now
a regular success yeah that'll hit roll
damage
uh nine so nice
you fairy fire was so much better in
first edition
uh you like blam you shoot him very well
um he doesn't seem to you know
he seems to be more wondering about the
you know why am i floating and on fire
uh
then you know oh look now i'm in pain
again what pay attention to me
[Laughter]
uh all right oh man he rolls a 98 on his
power roll
so you shoot him and as you shoot him
and like you're like that was a great
shot
i'm really good he like
me i give you a clapping alexandria's
expression if she sees that just
i give you a b we have to do like little
bows and curtsies to each other like
well it's done
first time your first time
you're amazing the self congratulations
society continues
um and um
does don julio know the threat is gone
i'll give him a roll
or wait i mean emma might be the threat
oh interesting uh
uh you both float back down to the
ground and the fire goes out
and don who and donald you see don julio
like collapsed to the to the to the
the the chair that he was sitting at
he's
purity
not on fire anymore the boat now this is
when you notice that parts of the boat
are on fire
i want to run over to don julio with the
with the butt of my gun i want to smack
him in the head
all right yeah he is he is um
he is pretty well out of it so you just
run right up and clock him and he goes
out
drag him out yeah i'll leave him here
to burn
we need no supplies we need the supplies
maybe
i gotta get some stuff out of the bottom
of this boat so the people in the boat
we're gonna come out of initiatives now
the people in the boat are panicking as
smoke is starting to fill up the
underbelly of the boat
the sailors are trying to like put out
the fire they're like
running and getting buckets and stuff um
you finally noticed that there's smoke
and fire now you start to see some smoke
coming from the harbor
oh we should probably maybe other people
are on fire
uh and that's when you see as you
come out of your cover
you see about a third of the way up the
building where the two guys were
uh the unmistakable form of alexandra
just like
looking for a handhold up the side of
the boat oh my god
so i'm i'm basically just gonna scream
at her
no don't she you just you just gave her
away
[Laughter]
no if i just scream alex it's not going
to give anything like
yeah you clearly hear professor lam and
you like and i'll startle and look and
just like turn around
it's like oh thank god
it's like dead i think the boat's on
fire
but what i'm gonna start jogging
yeah all right i i'm gonna get up to the
top of the roof and make sure
that the the person who was shooting at
us is actually dead
okay you get up to we'll we'll
deal with that in a second so you jog
down
to the to the dock and you see like
um a boat a large barge
with a bunch of people i really need to
stop saying that with a bunch of people
like running off of it
a bunch of very innocent looking people
running off
um you see um
sailors trying to like put this boat out
they're like running around
trying to get other buckets anywhere uh
they seem to they seem to have like the
three buckets that this boat has
oh i actually didn't make it all right
uh professor you find
like a a a wooden bowl
i got this donald you're getting
supplies right so you'll
you'll load up with a bun as much stuff
as you can carry
um and start to head up uh
emma what you're just trying to get
people off the boat i'm getting people
off the boat
yelling fire get to the get to the town
all right so yeah you
you have people lining up behind that
face of the building just in case people
start shooting again
alexandra you climb up and you see
leaning against the the sort of
wall of this roof of the building is
one one an egyptian guy
covered in ash kind of um
50 bleeding to death 50 like
just saw his friend turn to ash and got
showered in his friend
all right i'm gonna come over the edge
and he's just like oh
yeah and and and as i get my foot in on
the top of the roof i'm gonna draw one
one of my daggers and come walking over
it just casually held by my side looking
down
at him he'll say something in arabic
english he'll say something in arabic
all right well good enough and i'm just
like
glance around to make sure that it's
just the two of us and just like
stab him through the heart twist it all
right yeah you you kill him dead
uh you aren't assassin you don't need to
make a sand roll for
executions i've i've done this before
it's true so um
um you know at the boat you can get
the people off donald as you're
getting the supplies off
um so you're gonna need some help to get
all this stuff off
if i don't find a bucket i'm gonna tell
these people we need to get this stuff
we need this off the boat we can't
survive out in the desert for
two days or we need a gear we have to
get it out
what okay what oh yeah okay and then is
don julio in the hold of the boat right
yeah i knocked i hit him with the bottom
of my rifle yeah he went down he went
down
okay so is there a man next to me
sure there's like yeah there's several
guys so i like tie my scarf around my
face and i grab one guy and be like we
need to get
we need to get the supplies so i'm gonna
need a roll to convince normal people to
run into a burning boat
i'm running into a burning boat totally
burning
do you have any persuasion or fast talk
wait a minute abcdef
ghi there we go intimidate
nice i mean it's one way sure
that's it we're recently floating it on
fire you know there's a little singe to
you
you're like covered in blood from being
shot and you just grabbed the guy kind
of because my persuade is lower
oops
no i don't make it no but not my much
wait wait was this something we really
want to try to inspire preparation
is this a we need to know we've got
to get stuff off
i'm running in i mean
i'm going gonna go down and get it and
just like so
when you yell behind me you're gonna let
a woman run into a burning building
fine nice
does he have any shame well you know
what he doesn't have any shame when it
comes to burning
you know yeah this was a pilgrimage
and and and and once i'm sure that my
guy is dead i'm going to find the
quickest way back down and run back to
the boat
it'll take you a little bit to get there
okay so with
um with hollister and donald and emma um
you think that you can get probably
about
half maybe three quarters of the
supplies up before
the fire starts do
on getting him onto the deck okay so
uh everyone that's more cowardly which
is everyone else is staying away from
the burning boat i'm still throwing
water on it though yeah and
you and the sailors are trying to put
out a very wooden
uh a very dry boat fire um
do i see don julio yes when you go down
you see don julio like lying
uh he's lying on a in in a
a bench in the very back like in a
hammock essentially oh does he need help
you're not here i slap him
as hard as i can and yeah wake up man
and grab some more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and get upstairs
um so you like slap him and he is he
like
looks at you for a second and he says
but
but the purification was finished and
you're still
here yeah no kidding the boat's on fire
thank you very much
let's go grab some stuff
uh he'll start to he'll start
we'll start to like drag a few he's like
kind of dazed probably concussed and
he'll start to like take a little bit of
stuff up to the up to the top and out of
the boat
amazing i'm unloading i don't care
so so yeah i will say that before the
boat goes down
you will get two-thirds of the
uh and then hollister
and lamb can like bring you to the
warehouse
oh we i don't know because there's a
better place that you guys don't want to
go in there
yeah i'll i'll i'll i'll see joan just
give her a hug and relief like i thought
something happened out in the sphinx i'm
so glad to see you
oh yeah no i'm i thought you guys we
went we tried to go back to the the
the the yeah i went to the base twice
for you two
yeah and you guys weren't there we never
were told to go back to the base once we
left
well i sent rogers a message once we
apparently you
sent him on a wild goose chase and he
wasn't able to find you
he said he tried to contact you did you
get anything from him
no he didn't say that he didn't say he
tried to
oh all right all right yeah no i didn't
we didn't get anything from him as far
as i know
look at emma and donal did you get
something that i missed
let's hurry and get the rifles back in
yes because your character
what are we doing about don julio that's
an
excellent question oh he definitely
can't go in that building
[Laughter]
well and here's the thing i've got all
these people like what so just out of
game how long does it take to get to the
pyramids
about four hours yeah it's four hours
okay and do we have to leave at night is
that one of the things we have to do
or it would be better it would be better
to go at night because of the
the heat yeah so i think we should
totally walk through the desert
in the middle of the day no i think we
should sleep and then
sleep in the daytime and then go at
night well if we if anyone wants to go
there early and try and rescue of the
innocent people before
uh clive does his business there's
no what do you know what are you talking
about we're staying here
no clive is going to cleanse the area
but he's going to do its scorched earth
style
the worst thing far away from that
location well he's not doing it right
now
if some of us wanted to they could go
they could go
uh early and try and rescue some of the
innocent people
before otherwise no we've got our
innocent people we've got
our innocent people we don't need to
worry about anything else
are there innocent people at joshua
right now
yes who the hell is out there
there's no we're no we're at the shore
there's there's
no excuse who's who's out of the
pyramids that we need to be worried
about i don't know agatha
simply stated that there are innocent
people there or there will be
or there will be no she's in well then
we don't
then we don't take the innocence out
there until it's been cleansed
well her premonitions have been
pretty good up until now well then why
don't we go ahead and break that and say
we need to sleep
everybody you know we just like well
let's go building let's let's find a
building
yes all right oh gods
um i think i have i think i have better
first aid than you do
first aid because i did not i i won't
roll first day so yeah
i'll i'll like see that she's bladed and
just run i really want the
[Laughter]
i have some first aid too i have some
first aid too so yeah that is a
critical success on you emma wow all
right you get six points of damage back
with a critical success
there you go well i'm truly bandaged
yeah so i'm i'm like kneeling next
next to emma with with with bandaging
just like wrapping it up like okay
oh you got hit in the attack so you're
all down at the harbor you're having
this discussion
um i'm so glad we have a doctor that's
yip yapping about strategy and innocent
people
[Laughter]
i mean he's he's he's better at the long
term stuff i see
i see this sort of day-to-day [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we've
got to get these people in into
something yeah we have to find a
building oh we've got a building it's
right here where is this
no yes what happened here people
keep you don't see a boat sinking every
day
how did you set a boat on fire no there
was there's people up on this top and
they're the ones i'm looking for i'm
looking for a building by their chatting
yes oh well he points at the one where
the cult where the two cultists were
he's like
well you know that one was pretty
good we almost used that as our base
but there's a weird
you know there's something weird in the
basement is all i'm saying okay oh
that's where people were shooting at us
from
let's not do that then what it's pretty
much
our warehouse which is lovely i cleaned
up the vomit
thank you very much oh good thank you
i mean we've got we got food we got
rifles
uh you brought a lot of stuff back from
that dice that was very handy
yep that's not dr hollister why are we
well he he made a
eight-star triangle out of the bodies
of that's enough that's enough listen
these innocent people
they do nothing with us and nothing with
him
but
[Music]
apart again we just finally got our
need to be separated from us because
anyone anyone who's coming after us will
that doesn't make any sense if you've
got a group of
heavily armed me some
ability in the the arcane arts group
and then you've got another room full of
seems like very nice church-going people
yeah
who are you gonna kill i'm gonna kill
the very nice church-going people
who don't have guns and that's why we
need to put them on a separate room
in the cards professor lam is exactly
right as always
thank you thank you i've just started
watching hollister and all of this and
just like
okay okay let's go let's take
everybody to the separate room in the
warehouse whatever yes
yes hollister very carefully takes you
in the back room
of the like office it's a little
crowded
with everybody in there and clive's
like you know
the warehouse is open we got a truck you
could sleep in
it's got cots no that's that's where the
that's where the the star is
no it's not what is yeah it's in the
truck that's where agatha is
we want to move the truck around the
building we could do that
we don't want the truck outside of the
building no no no
well we just we want to make sure that
people don't see this come on
it's just for us it's just for us the uh
fellow what's your what's your name
again
our australian friend it's clyde dr
henry clive
i know you're gonna do some sort of
crazy ritual in the desert why don't you
just go do that
like right now let us take care of the
innocent people you do your thing
we'll stay here keep them safe and i
thought you wanted it
yeah yeah i i i think donald we need to
wait for
tomorrow for that but all of us stay
here
with the innocent people and if there
are there shouldn't be any innocent
people out at the pyramids
theoretically i mean just the ones that
yeah they're there who would be out
there why would they be out there
they could have taken not i don't think
they're interested
but agatha said they were innocents yeah
well yeah i mean agatha so agave said
that the good news is that the cleansing
ritual goes
swimmingly not a problem are summon the
things
they do the job bob's your uncle yeah
but but it's not just
evil people who who are apparently
around there she says
um well this is not an exact quote but
she said something like uh
some of your some of your innocent
people get a little too close
that's why we're going to stay here we
are going to stay here we are going to
stay here and we'll keep all of our
innocent people here and
the pyramids are four hours from here
there shouldn't be anyone wandering that
close
right but yeah somebody make me a spot
hidden role
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh boy not all of us
hard hard success 25 yeah hard success
critical
three three so as he's saying this all
of you at the exact same time go
where's don julio oh he's not in a son
he can do whatever he wants
no but still where is he if agatha says
he's innocent
then i'll i'll run in the direction
where did he go
i don't know i need to go and find that
man i grab a gun where's where did he go
like which direction was he i'm going to
take off in whatever direction he might
be
so he didn't have long to get somewhere
so you
um you come out you go back to the back
room where all the people were
um and the back door is open
and the people are all there except
don julio where did he go
well i'm looking in the direction of the
pyramids do i see anyone out
walking towards you don't see anybody
walking
do i see anyone traveling in any other
no sorry let me rephrase that you don't
see anybody
um there's not like a lone figure
like trotting out or anything like that
are there any are there any like
footprints in the sand
uh so dashur is not see you know there's
not much sand around here once you get
out of joshua there will be more
here it's mostly rubble i asked the
people where did he go
they're just like he he went out the
door we didn't okay
you told us to stay here and we're still
trying to figure out why the boat was on
fire
and why someone was shooting at us no
there's bad people here
so we're gonna keep you safe we're
keeping you safe
what do i see uh
you don't really you can make a track
roll i'm gonna try to make the people
after i've checked if i just see
anyone out there i'm gonna run back to
our rock and make sure
that it's where it is and grab the keys
to that to make sure no one can
all right yeah yeah your truck is is
it's still
by the by the by the star you're all
okay i go
[Music]
all right i'm yelling down julio all
right so
you you open the door and you yell don
julio um
um you you hear like skittering
you see an open a trap door
in the floor and you hear like some
noise down
below there was it a skittering or is it
a noise
it's more a noise than a skittering okay
it sounds like something moving
okay so i go to the door and i yell the
trap door and i yelled on julio
um
yes yeah you
hear don julio's voice it sounds
strained and he
um he says save yourself
and i'm out the only person in history
to ever
actually save themselves when someone
says save yourself
that's impressive all right yeah you you
i run back to the group that's
outstanding
i really think that is the only time
that's ever happened
oh my god every other time in history
someone said save yourselves
no save yourself all right
emma can read and follow directions
[Laughter]
outstanding yeah you you kick the
trapdoor shut and you go
walking out whistling a merry tune
i run back to the group and i'm like i
just heard don julio in the um
in the other building scream save
yourself
well clive said something was in that
basement didn't he
well now it's got down julio in that
basement
okay we need to secure the innocence
let's
let's make sure to secure the building
there and at least i don't know what's
happening this evening who knows what's
going on here all right
let me work on that we'll close the door
we'll have the part or something
get supplied there's got to be another
building comfortable
making some food is still talking to
them
yeah yeah jonah's been i mean they
actually are happy to just have someone
who's like
making banal chat with them and sort of
you know like
okay this is calming all right and jones
like telling them about why they're
there and
you know all this all the cool things
they're going to see
oh so i can't find another building as
an option
so it's basically those two buildings
are the only ones that are
um that are complete
that are still sound there are a couple
of like huts
and smaller buildings lots are fine yeah
but not enough for 14 people
yeah no we're good here this is good no
no no no no
you don't know hold on if there's a
couple huts in other buildings we can
spread them out and we have like
four to a oh oh no this is great we're
all together
we're having a good time no no no
there's a monster in the basement if all
of you talk at once i can't hear
any of you all i hear at the end of all
this blah blah blah blah is monster in
alex we could secure them in one
location we can protect them if we keep
them together
we'll make this location as safe as
possible we can watch over them we need
these people alive
yes if they die it's your blood
um are you having this conversation by
clive or by the people those are your
two
um you hear a scream from
uh the building that the the cultists
were in
inside this building let's not go
looking at the basements i've done that
before
yeah so have come out of a basement
you don't want the list no i'm going to
stay over here
zombies and protect what we have if
somebody wants to go look at that that's
fine but that's not our building
hollister are you going if you're going
you're not going alone
yeah i'm well i'm not going to go down
there but i'm going to open up the door
and see if it's getting out because if
it's getting out
then then i'm going to go with him don't
i if it's getting out we're gonna have
to deal with it we're just doing it on
the side
get out the streets don't go into his
life we're not going to go
we're not going in we're not going in
we're just looking to make sure it's not
be careful i'm not going into any
basements trust me so you both
um come into it's a warehouse very
similar to the one you're in
um much less bloody there is
except this one has in the middle of the
floor of the warehouse
a a now closed wood trap door
it's got like it's a wooden door with
like an iron ring
that you use to pull it up and
um is don julio actually killing it i
doubt it
maybe he's an inquisitor he's got
inspiration
he set that cultus on fire earlier
yeah but he needed a couple turns to
chant
ah i am not you stay here
i'm gonna run in and i'm gonna open it
up
you okay you are a madman but i'm i'm
going to stay
i'm going to stay a little bit back but
i have daggers in both hands
i rubbed a little off on you holly come
on go all right
um you are you just going to like open
it a little bit and look down
well i'm going to take out the gum and
have a gun ready and i'm going to open
it up
okay it is flickering like a
like bad torch light down there it's
sort of hard to see
um you look down and um
it looks like um
it looks like a a tunnel like you've
seen before have you seen those before
have you seen a dhole tunnel
no no there's a there's a
a round kind of natural tunnel that
seems to go
from one end to the other all right it's
very long
i'm gonna try and look at both sides and
i'm gonna listen there
it does not seem to like it seems to go
on in both ends
closing it and i'm walking out okay yeah
and
and as he walks out i'm gonna come
alongside and just like come come at his
shoulder he's like
we don't go into basements if we can
avoid it i didn't go in
good i didn't hear anything though
what did you see a tunnel going in
both directions
a tunnel did it look like it was
man-made
yeah i know it was can't really tell
there was some there was some torchlight
down there okay
i'd actually stop him before we go out
of the out of the warehouse and go
dr hollister what in the name of christ
well uh
[Laughter]
you keep telling us not to go into the
main area of the warehouse
yeah well the main area is just there's
there's body parts in there
we can't we can go in there i don't
recommend it um
jung threw up all over the the truck
body parts whose body parts
you remember the men with the guns at
the
sphinx yeah they were they're body parts
oh well we also
well we will we clive sacrificed one
of them earlier to make a spider portal
and then we found a occultist to make
another one when i went back
for all of you at the base
uh
and then cliven and
joan have been doing things which i
can say with an extreme amount of
confidence
they're not good for their well-being in
any
dimension that you can
perceive all right i don't know clive
very well but i know joan fairly well at
this point how bad
probably more than a week's worth of
stress on her body over the course of
two days
um what most of her sleep has been drug
induced
uh i'm pretty sure clive had a heart
attack
from it so from what
the magic they're doing what magic are
they doing
uh time magic and and they're they're
reading books
again
you're a psychiatrist in your
professional opinion
free fall i don't even need to finish
that sentence in your professional
opinion
we're gonna want to get this stuff over
with as quickly as possible
uh they're they're they're entirely
focused
on completing this task and they're
they're willing to do anything to
themselves if they think that it will
give them
an edge and in clive's case things to
other people
um we should all be sleeping with one
eye open
all right you you you need to be aware
then because
of who you report to this is not the
first time that joan has gone to extreme
circumstance
extreme degrees to get power
to get information which is power in
this
she's nearly died several times i've
read the reports
and i would say they pale in comparison
to what i'm seeing now
i was going to say reports are clinical
what we saw was was her getting torn to
pieces by an alligator person and using
the power of the staves to heal herself
reports are very clinical and don't
cover the whole truth
and between you me and the brick wall i
am
very concerned if she's getting that
kind of power
from reading a lot of books a lot of
book
which book one book which one song of
the doll what in the name of the hells
i will not
a i have six and cthulhu made those and
b i don't make it through the meet those
so you two are having that conversation
outside well
we're still we're still we're still just
inside of that warehouse where we heard
the screaming but
emma jones and donald you are kind of
getting the people situated and
everything
i want to secure the location i'm trying
to yeah you've got everything locked
down
inventory our stuff yeah i'm just
talking to them make them sure they calm
down
as you're doing that clive
will walk in and say well you know the
bad news is
that agatha's not really seeing the
uh but the good news is she says that
the ritual
is just a banger
right which ritual are we talking about
oh the whole
putting the port the eye back and that
sort of thing she says it's
it's it's wildly successful she says
sweet
okay good and that's why she has to
kill us
all what what
yeah i i had the same reaction it
doesn't seem
it makes no sense it doesn't sound like
the agatha i know and love
did something get to her too well
i mean you know she has been saying the
black pharaoh is coming for quite some
time
so i would not go
in that other room where are you all
right
i'm i'm okay with that yeah
i'm not hoping so
the ritual that i did to resurrect her
the dream that i had that explained to
me the ritual that i performed to
resurrect agatha
uh suggested that if her head
left that star then she would die
i'm hoping that's still true because um
i beat a rather hasty retreat from that
room
is as agatha was starting to grow
teeth and that sort of thing
i mean like she has teeth right i mean
something well no look look
i'm an australian i come from a
continent where everything on the
continent is trying to kill you
so i don't want to alarm anyone
and also i'll see this whole thing
you're doing with hello
nice people who are all here you want to
keep them all nice and calm
so you know i just want to very
carefully and calmly say that
um she's got a lot more teeth than she
had before
she's all right then let's kick her out
of that that
that let's let's kick her out of the
circle let's do it she's
she's becoming something then if we kick
her out of the sucker she'll die
perfect god damn it
she's given us all the information she
can right
yes now if she's something else we need
to get rid of it
i'll get the show dr dr lam is exactly
right
i think it is time that we and he
looks at all the people
um i think it is time that we uh
uh we help agatha on to her to meet her
eternal maker
all right let's let's let's religious
lot here i see uh
we're gonna send her to heaven yes yes
it's her turn it's her time
in fact i'm not stating all that you
know
i'm just wondering if we should maybe i
don't know start
dinner outside right now oh dinner
sounds nice
i think you know not again to cause any
undue
need of worry or or concern i think we
should deal with the
the agatha situation before i take the
shotgun
i got a couple extra here well now i
thought like i said
let's not scare the people no i'm saying
just
go out let's go out we should ask them
to set up the table outside maybe
you know start the certifier and then
we'll drink food
that's a lovely one there more of you
i don't know i mean there's there's a
yes
yes a couple of us are dealing with some
other things right now but let's
deal with this let's we'll deal with
this
something do we really want to send the
people outside
all alone no we don't know i'll take
like i'll take them outside and we'll
start to
you know have them i will go with you
i'm with you secure the people secure
them inside just keep them here
and then we'll go deal with whatever the
hell are this becoming all right
get the shotguns oh listen to that
yeah that's that must have been a big
rat nothing to worry about there
sure it's funny donald you're an
exterminator you go get it
yeah you stay here with the people i'll
i'll help you guys i'll help you clive
let's go clive let's go see what kind of
animals are out there let us let us know
when hollister and i are coming back
because
no we're going to get i'm getting
hollister and alexander you're going to
the other building
i'm going to get them okay and then
we're going to
i'm i'm going i'm going with clive the
that's how they got there that's how the
cultists got underneath that building
so so donald you walk up as clive is
saying the tunnel underneath goes to the
goes to the pyramid oh hollister i'm
hollister
sorry we're all doctors so we all
blended together
i'll hand him a shotgun here here's a
shotgun doctor
oh i've got it i've got it i've got a
gun no i don't know
i don't know how to use that you know
you pull the trigger
yeah yeah hold up my my right my uh
revolver that thing away
no i don't know how to shoot it
let's go clive let's go climb let's go
let's just let them argue let's see all
right
they're outside we'll get to that but
we're gonna we'll do this i'm going to
put a hand on
on donald trump what's going on the uh
you're going to have to be more specific
yourself do i hear she's the future
right the girl sees the future as
uh is becoming some sort of agatha and
she's going to kill us
no i think she's hold on i'm going to
jog
doctor i'll take care of this hold the
shotgun let's deal with it i've already
gone off i'm not holding a shotgun
all right so you start heading back
towards the building all right now
joan and clive so you start to you go
towards the door
and he says i just want to warn you you
know
if you're going to chunder again don't
that's all i'm asking all right i'm
there
i'm i my will is here
we're we're we're coming up behind them
i assume well
it'll be a minute you you headed out so
um
uh and they you actually went to that
other building so there's
there's a little time there right as
as he reaches for the door
uh professor lam you hear clive under
his breath saying
i'm a survivor i'm a survivor we're
survivors
we're survivors he looks at you a little
weird
um sure yeah i've not heard anything
from agatha about you
no you're a survivor all right he opens
the door
um and you both head in
uh he closes the door after you and he
says now um
when i was in here she'd gotten quite
large
so it's probably easy to find her
i i i i'm i'm all about the gun and now
okay i'm gonna ask you a second favor
first you know don't throw up in me
second please don't shoot me
perfect no i i clyde you and me we're

sort of cowering
in a corner of the
of the office part with emma trying
to keep them calm

um to the office part and you see
clive and joan just like

careful do you ever damn it

you know do you have a light let's get
some lights yeah of course
and we'll grab one of the lights give
any torches
i meant electrical kind of torch but
the other sort will work too
yeah i was thinking about electrical
torch as well yeah oh
fancy well there you go just stick one
of these in the fireplace and
um i'm just looking at joan and
the way that she's looking at clive and
i'm like oh
no and i open the door so you guys are
actually standing in the you you are in
the room you're at the front of the room
the room goes back
where you are is the hood of the truck
and then the truck takes up most of the
room so you're gonna squeeze by the
truck on either side
right behind the truck is where the star
was and then a little ways behind that
there were some boxes
and then the door and five says so as i
told
joan before this um
when i was in here agatha had gotten
quite
large and look
look up is she up the ceiling on top of
the truck
it's hard to tell with the just
torchlight but it doesn't seem so
also you know in retrospect the whole
eight-hand thing might have been a
mistake
why i just roll my eyes why
well you know it seems like they've been
incorporated in whatever this new form
of egg if this is
am i around have i squeezed by the truck
yet so you just want
all right so hollister just and and and
when he does that and i get the answer
that i'm looking for i'm going to melt
to the other side of the truck and just
let it just like blend into the shadows
oh how handy how handy clive
i'm following alexandria if the doctor
can distract me i just scream at this
point
i'm distracted i'm distracting clive
that's basically it
um so you know
you you don't have to squeeze by the
truck it's about a shoulder's length
from the
the the end of the truck to the wall my
back's against the wall
sure yeah yeah paranoid
always in torchlight
the the eight-pointed blood star has
just been
i'm gonna whisper what the hell under my
breath
oh yeah for those of you who haven't
seen well actually
uh you know now it's just a puddle of
blood on the floor you're fine
i've see i've i've slid through a puddle
yeah i remember we had a rustling match
uh is she not up there
i'm holding the torch forward i'm i'm
not going to answer him because i'm
trying to
to like blend into the shadows hold on
does she
did she go under the truck i mean
as i said you said she was big
i don't see anything big well she was
large and so i didn't think she would be
under the truck
oh no under the truck i'm looking and no
you like lean down you don't see
anything under the truck
um you're aware of the back of the truck
you know the truck is like
covered a fabric open where all the
stuff is oh god don't
don't have eaten all the supplies i'll
pop open the back of the truck
all right so you slide around the back
of the truck the back of the truck is
open it's like a
uh convoy vehicles
yeah i'm i'm keeping the gun trained on
the
opening okay so
okay but no agatha not that you can
see no
agatha where are you
uh all right what are you
uh alexandra and donald are you just
like covering him what are you
no so so so so as we get towards the
bottom
right initiative first we're going to go
into initiatives
so donald trump i'm creeping along with
alexandria silently
on the opposite side of where the doctor
is and where they're all making all the
noise and sneaking around behind the
flank
and come up whatever is going to attack
them right all right so you're on the
edge you're you've come around to the
back edge of the truck
you see the doctor like leaning in to
the back of the truck
um looking around and um
you've got a rifle at the ready i will
ready my rifle and i will wait
quietly okay something to happen yeah
um it's it's very dark
um the light right now is a guttering
torch
from dr hollister and it's mostly in the
truck right now too so you can't
do well any anywhere else
all right that was 80s 70s alexandra um
knowing that that donald is covering the
back of the truck i'm gonna close my
eyes and just
listen to hear to see if i can hear
anything that sounds
she seems to have an affinity for the
spider things so anything that sounds
like a scraping or a scratching or
skittering of a spider or anything like
that he mentioned the hands which makes
me think that it's an eight-handed
spider
that we're dealing with so most of
what you hear is clive and joan
bickering
yeah but i'm trying like i'm closing my
eyes and focusing to try to get past
that that sound
funny story it's very difficult to get
past the sound
of joan you said she was large
i'm i'm going to disclose someone
repeatedly in the leg
[Laughter]
there this this room is a wash in the
sound of those two like bickering at
each other
all right so frustrated by all of the
noise i'm gonna like creep up a little
bit
further past it past the edge of the
truck along the wall
not in the area sorry you are out in the
open at that point
yeah i'm trying to press myself up
against the wall so i'm i'm away from
like the
away from the blood but like out in the
open a little bit more and i have i have
a dagger in my hand
as always all right as is custom
60s that's professor lamb all right it's
like i'm gonna go say just like
shh we gotta find her you're the one
you asked me a question i answered the
question
you're telling me i'm just i'm yelling
at this point
is the door closed yet the door closed
when they are okay
yeah we closed the door behind us
however
if i had initiative i would shut the
door that way i'd be like
you can even through the closed door you
hear joan and clot you sort of hear
joan and clive in a muffled
like yelling at each other
um are you doing anything besides uh
everybody and kind of angling myself to
be like okay if i've got to wrangle
people out
the the outside that's where i'm sort of
like keeping people from
the door where they're at okay all right
um
uh the the hollister how does the
how does the back of the truck look i
mean is it just covered with blood
um yeah i mean it looks like something
just vomited
blood on everything here okay well
that's
good thing the mris are sealed um
it's gonna be okay the rifles will need
some cleaning
but is that how you guys pronounce them
the mres
yeah you pronounce them emery's
not emery's mre that's what i heard you
say it was emery's
the way he said it was emery's yeah it's
something yeah
i just learned it that's nice yeah
um so yeah i'll take the torch out of
the back and now
bring it back towards the more open area
because there's boxes
all right make me a spot hidden roll
with the torch
um
agatha how are you doing
you're hungry all right we'll deal with
that in a minute donal
i am readying an action to shoot it when
silently waiting with my shotgun ready
all right alexandra
um i'm i'm still creeping a lot along
the wall keeping to the shadows as much
as i can
but i feel like whatever we're dealing
with is going to be out here and i want
to have the shortest
uh path possible when it shows itself so
yeah
i'm going to like the boxes that you
mentioned i want to like creep behind
those and use this as cover okay yeah
yeah you will get
to the bat and you can now see the front
door of the warehouse
um it's closed and
um it's so you're out of the
out you're out of the light of the torch
yeah so you can sort of see
you know you can sort of see what's
going on there's shadows everywhere
um it's it's a creepy place
creepy place i just love this like my my
hands are shaking a little bit
holding my daggers but just like holding
on and just
we're doing this joan what do you got
i i'm gonna go to clapping and go shh
we've got to find her
let's go and then i'm gonna have him
walk her
with me and see if he will walk with me
around the other side of the truck
i should stay here and guard the duel
fine and i'm just gonna go all right
[Music]
um so you you go up and you see donal at
the edge of the truck
i'm on the other side donald you are
very oh so you're on the you're on the
side with with dr hollister
i'm not i don't i'm asking joan sorry
so well i figured if he was on this i'm
i'm i was on this side of the truck
on one side and i'm on the other okay no
problem yeah you come up and you see
uh dr hollister is now shining the torch
out into the room
uh at large okay um
emma make me a listen roll
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
oh there goes tom
i hear everything it's a 9. yeah um
you hear skittering in this in the
ceiling
in my ceiling like it like i would
assume
having lived in a new york tenement like
it would be between
the walls kind of thing yeah that's
exactly right yeah
is it heading towards the outside door
like where's
is it coming from that room going which
way
whoo you got a really good roll
yeah i got a niner yeah it seems like
uh it seems like it is sort of
almost going in a circle uh
up above you is are joan and
clive still yelling uh
yes they're about to stop you hear us
okay so i'm i back up to the door open
it and i'm just like
you know what i mean you know how you're
so you you open the door and start
snapping and clive says
what what she's in the ceiling
she's in the ceiling well something's in
the ceiling
something's in the ceiling yes
did the rest of us hear this right there
um
clive's like oh i do hear that
i'm assuming jones next to him right uh
clive looks at you
i don't want to say that much louder
okay okay and i do this
all right he makes an ungodly noise
he says words that your brain hears
and immediately rejects and
um and
uh all of the sudden there is
a there's a flash of light
and and
you hear you all hear a ripping
and a tearing and it sounds like the
worst like
cats in heat fight you've ever heard and
it's going on
in the ceiling all the way across this
thing
and there's just like this awful
like tussling noise
going on up there and clive looks
and he says uh
i don't think she was expecting that
do i hear the noise getting closer to me
is she on the roof there's
so it's it apparently there's some sort
of like attic crawl space or something
or she's on the roof one of the two um
uh at that point make me an
ooh i don't know is it worth spent no
it's not worth spending wait what's my
intelligence it's only 20 right look at
it's no it's not worth spending no it's
only 20. it's not we're just only
getting the five points to make it
wow oh you rolled at 25. let it go
just let it go all right yeah
everything's fine
um yeah my natural instinct would be to
get everybody away from wherever the
scattering is
so and by everybody you mean the people
right
mm-hmm so um
well if it's on the roof and they go
outside they might see it
so you you think of the people
yeah and you look over and they did not
avert their eyes
and you see 14 people all
and we're gonna go back to initiatives
because
uh as you all become aware of whatever's
going on up there
um it all of a sudden in the
middle of the room right about where the
puddle of blood is so kind of all around
you
a whirling ball of awfulness
crashes through the ceiling
and you see um
a one of those blade spiders
um and you see uh
um and you see agatha's head
with eight like barbed tentacles
coming out of her teeth that she is like
walking on
and each each of the eight barbed
tentacles
and each of these hands um
is like has just sharp claws and it's
just clawing at this thing
um emma
you missed the intelligence roll but
make me a spot hidden roll
how did i get an 80-10 so that one might
be a 90.
no i mean an 80-10 on the birds of
paradise is an 80.
yep so i've got yeah so i've got an 80
or an 81 which i'd make it
it's just regular success though all
right so
um so as you're looking you know like
you look over at the people who are all
paralyzed
um and
uh with a regular success you will
notice that one of the people
one of the people's eyes are just gone
um the person is still just like
but there are just open cavities where
its eyes would where his eyes would be
so if it's not if i feel well right now
i feel like threatened so i'm not gonna
do anything
all right and clive sees you notice
that and he says
well i did ask you to avert your eyes
[Music]
you know there's there's some sacrifice
so i decided to just stay like my next
game plan
is to just stay behind clive wherever
he's at all right
okay uh
uh so and then you guys hear the smash
as they come in
uh from there so um
we're gonna go back to initiatives so
oh hold on i'm gonna so
if you want you can
shoot indiscriminately and you're going
to have
a chance of hitting either of the awful
things in there
or you can aim specifically for agatha
and then you're going to take a penalty
die
i'm firing at the massive offal there we
go
sure roll me a d6 this is well it's
46 damage but for a shotgun but i'll
just do it
yeah oh wait you're firing a shotgun yes
okay then you're going to hit both of
them
so dr hollister make me a luck roll
as a shotgun is going off in a
okay we'll inspire that i was gonna say
we've got a lot of this going on here so
let's let's inspire that it's a good use
of yeah
all right um
15 damage okay 15. up
dr hollister you're gonna take five
points of damage
from from the random shotgun
um joan you are mostly protected
because you're at the side of the truck
uh so you will not take any damage
any training shotguns
not me we'll talk about training after
this is over if you're alive
uh tactically what this what you should
be doing and you shoot into the ball of
awfulness
yes all right 70s alexandra all right
um after i hear the shotgun blast go off
i'm
i'm going to regret every decision i
have ever made and run in to stab the
ball of awfulness that's a bad decision
yes it is
like all right it is and i don't care
let's do this at the the spider thing
i mean so because because i have a
dagger and i'm very good at using my
dagger or my 97 says so
i'm aiming specifically at agatha as
best as i can
all right so you're going to take the
penalty die but before that happens
as you head into the whirling ball of
awfulness make me a dodge roll
okay oh man
birds of paradise metal dice
critical success at an 11. well
unfortunately
critical success of an 09
okay i feel critical with your critical
mate
uh you have to so dot if an attack is
successful the dodge has to beat the
attack you can't get
critical success so
um as you are running up with your
dagger um
you're not sure if it's the horrible
spider blade thing
or if it's the horrible agatha thing but
something
um definitely takes a slice out of you
uh you take
four points of damage okay
um and and now yeah take your knife
you're gonna so
if you're going for agatha you'll take a
penalty die yeah and i'll take the panel
to die but definitely like stagger and
cry
out before before going in and then
stabbing yeah
neat that's a hard success all right
that's that's max damage yes it is so
that is uh
six points of damage with my dagger
all right so you stab in and you stab
um one of the barbed tentacles
uh of of agatha and
um it's the dagger goes through it like
smoke is it
gone or is it no no it just
like it it dissipates and then
immediately reforms
all right i want to get back out of
there because i have a feeling that
donald's going to shoot into that again
and i don't want to be anywhere in that
radius
you are very close to this make me a
spot hidden roll alexandra
okay 66
success so the spider
seems to be having the same problem you
are where it takes a swipe at this thing
and like passes through it like smoke
does it seem to be aiming at the limbs
like i was
um this so this spider is not an
intelligent being
it is just a you know it is just a um
eight blades and eyes and
it is not it is seems to be
indiscriminately just slicing
and it doesn't seem to be doing anything
okay so i see it like pass through the
head and not do anything
yeah sure okay i will
yell that as i'm as i'm dashing to get
back out of there
what do you yell yeah what do you so
here's the thing
yelling for you is hard yeah it is
i do have the operatic training even
i'll give you a po i'll give you a bonus
die okay
um but you know when we talked about
this you know singing
is like you know you sing at a low
microphone
uh and you know sort of amplified way
you've really lost
yeah so so yelling is you know what i'll
make you an offer
you can be successful no problem if you
take damage yourself
or you can make the role with a bonus
die
i'll i'll take the bonus time okay my
didn't need to be 18 success there you
go yeah so you yell
out what do you yell out um
it's not taking physical damage yeah
that's a very weird thing that only
gamers would say you know what
i saw it sliced through and it's
something that that
out of there then get out i'm kidding
and i'm gonna run all right yeah you
will um
well so here's the i mean you you you'll
start to move back you're still gonna be
if he fires the shotgun you're still
gonna be in the blast because
you ran up to to attack and you can't
like dart in dart out
yeah knowing that
i'm gonna get low like i'll i'll i'll
get prone if i need to
okay yeah you you just drop right down
because i just dropped dropped to the
ground like shoot
uh let's see that was 70s joan
oh boy i i i alexandra is too close for
me to shoot because
i know that i'm not sure if you have a
rifle you don't have a shotgun
and i'm and i'm on the ground now okay
all right
um you've got a rifle you know you're
not going to be sending out a spread of
sean
that's true that's true i'm going to and
i am going to try to shoot
at agatha because
i can't believe she she turned on us
like this so i'm going to try
all right take to break the star so this
will be a penalty
okay so all of them
worked um
yeah my highest roll was a 20 which is
what i needed
okay so that's a roll your damage 25 25
i don't even know what that is what is
the damage for a rifle rifle is 66
nine okay yeah blam
you you you fire into it quite nicely
uh
um dr hollister
yeah her shot how do i see it
you can make a spot hidden roll there's
a lot going on in there
yeah i know i'm i'm specifically looking
if anything is hitting the hands
the hands are the whole point of the
i mean i don't make it but close but
anyhow i already
it's hard to tell it's hard to tell um
there's there's a lot going on in there
you're sure you saw like the spider like
pass
slice through a hand but you're not 100
sure
i mean i still i mean that's it still
makes sense i'm gonna move
in a way so that donald doesn't shoot
me again
all right try to behind the truck maybe
i'm gonna try and get a shot into one of
the hands if it looks like it's holding
onto the ground at one point
or something to sure you slide back a
little ways you can take a shot you'll
uh are you shoot so you're shooting
specifically at a hand that's a penalty
die
i do not hit all right
uh another shot rings out
a weird thing occurs to you as you're
sort of
um you're like you know clive is slowly
like kind of scaredly back
going towards the door and you're with
him and that is that
um the people
aren't reacting well i guess they're
frozen so it's not that weird
all these gunshots are going off and
they aren't reacting at all
um and um
you hear um
the best thing i can describe is you
hear a noise like pop pop
i don't want to look i push clive
actually back towards agatha
and i'm like do something um
you started this he's out of the circle
so you push him and clive looks back at
you and then his eyes get wide
he says whatever you do don't look
behind
you
and that's where the popping noise is he
pulls you in and he slams the door
shut so that you're now in the room with
all the agatha stuff
okay and i'm back at the i'm with clive
still
right we're still together he didn't
like push me in by him
and then lock the door and here's your
scary news for the day he rolled an 04
what
um clive is crying into your shoulder
no i just grabbed him by the shoulders i
was like you did this man
fix it do that i did not do that
it's all there god it's terrible
what is it bam stamp out of it clive
shouting from the other side of truck i
came in when you were doing this
i saw you fix it i don't know what
spells you've got up your sleeve but
pull one of them out of your magic
little bag of tricks
i do this again he's thinking i'm just
like fix it
he looks at you and he says yes
uh-oh i just need to do a spell and he
touches you on the forehead
um and and as his finger comes toward
you like
sacrifice
