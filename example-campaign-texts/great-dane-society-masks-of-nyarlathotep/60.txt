last session you managed to
get
uh 13 innocent-ish people
to dashur
and you managed to bring the group
together unfortunately what brought the
group together was an
ambush by cultists emma was
uh pretty badly injured by the
surprise by the ambush
uh and part of the
part of the surprise of the ambush not
to that that
kind of helped you and kind of hurt you
was that our old friend don julio
had tagged along um
and he had he had
somehow managed to fry one of the
cultists
along with trying to fry donal and
emma yeah and uh
uh he had disappeared the duck
the duchess had also and uh
i did i didn't i didn't it was
i said the duchess and i know i
i heard you pause and listen to yourself
uh the the duchess and tidwell
by the way my wife is slightly convinced
that i'm going senile
because i'm starting to have a real
problem with names
like not like you know your names but
like
i'll just be like people's names like
fake people's names like the people in
your head
no like fake like fake people like you
know the characters in hard castle and
mccormick
or you know
oh speak okay all right speaking of 80s
tv
all right so again
80s tv terrible we had
five channels you watched whatever was
on
uh there was a show called riptide
riptide the conceit of which was
two two
manly private detectives and one nerd
and his pet robot
it's the 80s so his pet robot looked
like
i don't know like it actually kind of
looked like those parking
robots you now see in malls and stuff
back when you could still go to malls
um and they they lived the the two
pis
lived on a a houseboat
and the the conceit of the show was that
they would get hired
and then they would hire the nerd to
help them out
and they had a contest
running throughout the show so even at a
young age i appreciated a running bit
and riptide's running bit was that
the two pis had an ongoing contest
of who had had something happen to them
the most
uh and it would happen throughout the
episodes
um i'm actually might make this a
contest maybe this is the youtube
this is the youtube contest what
for a copy of the call of cthulhu
coloring book
what was it that the what was the
contest in riptide
that the two pis competed in
what were they the first person to put
that in the youtube chat will win a copy
of the call of cthulhu coloring book why
do i know these things
um you have a very odd eclectic memory
oh man tigerion makes is now he he just
said he can't remember a single 80s
cartoon and i'm about to turn this into
a
three hour dissertation on pandemonium
oh all right that's i won't do that
uh so yeah the the
duchess and tidwell disappeared
somewhere
um don julio disappeared um
they they they found
a another tunnel apparently dug by doles
uh and don julio seems to have
disappeared down that they
uh they found uh
they they found in in another building
uh you managed to
shepherd the 12 remaining innocent
people
into the warehouse where you were
staying and
mostly keep them away from clive's
horror show
and and then agatha
came back to life in some sort of
horrible spider form that you only sort
of saw
and you um
you you managed to
find your way through here you managed
to shoot yourselves more than anybody
else really
um we
this is why i don't use guns one of the
several reasons
yeah so um
you you managed to yeah there was some
collateral damage
and um
joan and to to to sort of set the stage
in the warehouse
there is the back of the warehouse
the door that leads into the office
where
all the innocent people are um
are emma
don't look behind you yes and then he
did he put his finger up to your head
and everything went black
yep i don't know if it's black or not
yet i mean the show was over so
um and yes and clive has we'll
we'll get to
what clive did in a second and then
there is the truck
which has been pulled into the into the
warehouse
the hood of the truck facing towards
with that door
where emma and clive are there's about
four
three to four feet on either side where
people have been coming
around and there you have hollister
and professor lamb on one corner and
donal and a shotgun on the other corner
uh in and and then you have the
rest of the warehouse where a horrible
uh a horrible blood circle that used to
have hands in it but does not anymore
uh is festooning the floor
and i that's about where we are
and so emma ooh wait tamagotura
us 500 bits we need that i'm going to
put it here there you go very nice
holy crap thomas just dropped casually
in the chat
that his friend's father-in-law was jan
i am definitely the baby at this table
and i'm reminded of that now and again
oh man airwolf airwolf had a great
soundtrack it was a terrible show
it was airwolf airwolf was kind of like
gi joe in the sense that
the whole the whole setup for airwolf
was they had this
mega super helicopter that had like
50 caliber cannons on it and the whole
show had to be built around them not
shooting
anybody they do things like
all right if we shoot the road if we
shoot the bridge in front of them
they'll have to stop
airwolf loved it all right um
yeah this can i should stop all right so
we are remember when i said at 602 and
02 seconds
literally if we keep this up for about
40 more seconds we're 30 minutes into
announcement
all right so
uh emma you have been touched on the
forehead
and all of the sudden uh
everything is moving ridiculously slow
cool so everyone around you
including clive for the for the
for the moment is moving in slow motion
okay and where is alexandria and where
is
spider lady spider lady you do not
see
alexandra is around the front of the
truck as well
uh having just danced with a shotgun
i didn't dance with the shotgun i danced
with a spider and then and
and then and then hit the ground it's
true though i wouldn't dance the shotgun
okay and when i turn behind me what so
you are turning around
no never mind never mind dumb idea
um so i'm gonna run up to alexandria
and grab a knife grab the longest knife
i can find
are they all the same length man yeah
they're all they're all basically
stilettos
yeah just don't have any spawn you'll
find one yeah they're they're well she's
got she got one
she's got two drawn so yeah you just
walk right up
and make me a spot hidden role
emma
okay here comes bird apparent bird oh
paradise come on bird
i like how they're like wow new in
shrink
if you open them they lose resale value
okay that's one of these kinds
uh oh that's one of these kinds okay
oh you know oh 87 i'm wait hang on
what's my spot hidden element
nope my spot hidden's 86 and i missed it
let's use an inspo
all right i like it cool
push it push it real good 74.
at least i rate it so you made it all
right so
even though you are moving super fast
clive's eyes are still tracking you
so he's he's aware of your
your he's aware of where you are and how
you're moving
um to everyone else you're essentially a
blur
and so alexandra make me
a
42 okay yeah i am sorry i'm not strong i
am fast not strong
so all of a sudden one of your knives
just disappears
right out of your hand like just
tell me you took it out of the left hand
i'm right-handed i'm assuming so because
well it depends was it up like this
38 success all right yeah so she took it
from your left hand
um and so yeah you you now have a knife
yeah we're going to go into initiatives
and emma
here's how we're going to do this you
are going to have the first initiative
and the last initiative every round
um to to sort of show your
uh yeah must be the quickness
so what do you get emma what are you
gonna do
um so i look around do i see the spider
now that i'm in
in the room so once you you are
you do not see the spider in the
warehouse i was under the spider when we
ended
so the spider was gone it went up
right yeah it went up
okay so i'm talking about spider agatha
yes
yes yes so so you actually heard
when clive said don't look back you
heard noises
in the office with the people
i believe i described them as pop pop
pop pop pop pop
yep um
yeah that's gross i'm assuming terrible
things have happened
two of them i'm assuming i may not be
right
but does does dr hollister i forgot dr
hollister still has the flashlight
yes porch and we're talking old-school
torch it's true he actually has a
literal torch
an old torch not a no not a flashlight
torch
oh my god this is going to be amazing
i'm going to grab the torch and like
wave it around to see if i can find the
spider
so it's going to be like the trippiest
yeah there's like it looks like one of
[Music]
superimposed
at a certain point you're just putting
on a show yeah a little bit i'm writing
my name
uh light show well thank you for letting
me know who nicked my dagger
of course i would i would fire write my
name yeah that's
i love it yeah like all of a sudden it
says emma in like
[Laughter]
you do not see the spider thing in the
warehouse
okay do i still get some more action
or am i
that's your first one you'll again
you'll go at the very end
um so uh
uh let's see donald you have a readied
firearm
so i think that puts you at 130.
but the target is gone right
for a certain value of the target
certain value there's no one
there's not one target don't tell dr
hollister that
he yeah he just gets in the line of fire
all the time he needs some training
but i imagine went up to the ceiling got
a rush underneath where it went
turning my gun up towards the hole all
right so yeah you run up into the middle
of the room
uh into the sort of the circle where
uh alexandra was in front of the
rear of the truck that's a really great
way to describe that and you're just
like
looking up at the ceiling and and you
see the word emma
burning in the sky to the left of you
dream come true well
whatever i don't know i don't even know
how to process that
but there's no there's no spider up
here you cannot see a spider on the roof
and it's nicely lit up by the um
the the the m i was trying to put
ambience and emma together and it wasn't
working beyonce
any skittering sounds movements anything
uh you
like i said you heard you heard
claw well make make a listen roll okay
yeah hard success all right yeah you you
heard clive say
very quietly to emma um
don't look behind you and then you heard
like
you heard noises in the office where the
the people are
oh no okay i'm gonna start rushing back
towards the office all right so yeah you
ran into the middle and you pointed your
gun up next round you can run
towards the office um
uh gosh i don't remember what i
pretended like clive's dex was
uh well let's find out
oh wow okay 80s that would be donald
when he wasn't ready
70s alexandra all right i'm going to
kick back up and
and get on my feet again and like look
around i'm currently
down a dagger and just like oh
and once again you've been rolling in
blood yep
although this was mostly dried by this
point well dried and i imagine there's
like some sand going on there
it's yeah it's not great so you know i'm
i'm gritty and nasty but not necessarily
covered in blood but i see the emma
written across the side i really want
that to be an episode title but it would
never work
uh i see i see the emma written across
the sky look down at my head and go
don't know how you did it all right um
and i'm going to start looking around
as well to try to figure out where this
spider thing went and i i imagine i see
donald starting towards that
yeah yeah you'll see him starting
towards the front of the to the office
yeah
yeah oh the player thinks it's a
terrible idea but that's what alexandria
would do so she
she heads in that direction with him to
be like we're tracking this thing down
all right so yeah you'll be heading with
him um
also on a 70 um
the two of you turning the corner and uh
also
hollister and joan um
you'll hear clive you'll hear clive
say
uh now you've got a shay
oh nine very nice
all right so you will lose
you you lose actually two magic points
okay and do i how do i feel about that
um you feel like that was about
the best case scenario um
and you feel like and dr clive is now
moving
a little faster but not a ton faster
okay um
all right that was that that was 70s 60s
yeah joan so wow okay so i'm looking
around
i got to see alexandria get
jumped on and and then the shotgun went
off
gone shotgun went off all i've got is my
my handy crowbar and so
sorry and a rifle that you're very good
i do have a rifle don't i yeah and
apparently you're amazing
i totally forgot about that um
but okay so i have my rifle on my
crowbar but what i was gonna do is i was
going to
to erase or try to erase
the thing on the ground because i think
that's what's i think that's what's
doing everything
so i'm going to get rid of the blood
circle that's what i'm doing
okay you're going to like try and break
that circle yes okay
uh it's so you run up and you start to
like kick sand
into the and it it will start yeah you
will you will easily
like you know especially yeah using
the the crowbar
it'll like start to scrape it away and
you have you've cleared out like
a small section of between
so it was an eight-pointed star so
you've you've cleared out one of the
sections between
two of the points where not so long
ago there were hands
but there are no longer hands perfect
hands down
hands about to be up 70s that was 60s
50s 40s dr hollister
yeah i'm we need to just leave this
place
and i'm going to like is there is there
a door to open to get the truck out
yeah there's like a warehouse door in
the front right yeah i'm gonna run over
and open that
all right so you start to open that door
no problem
uh it is sorry it is not a sliding
door it's actually two barn doors
that will open that way and so yeah
you you start to you start to open that
door that is that is no problem
uh all right second emma
yep which i'm a 40 so i'm at the bottom
usually anyway
um again so i'm gonna steal myself
because
i think that there are not great popping
scenarios
that means that like and emma's had
either their eyeballs have been blown
out or
yeah or more like they're just kind of
been squished
like little human nuggets like little
human chicken nuggets
and open the door and look and see
what's
in store with my 13 innocent people all
right so you
uh you throw open the door and um
yeah you are you you have a
a a horrible sight in front of you um
as how many how many do i lose
uh as behind
so so you open the door and
the the 13 uh
the 13 people are kind of standing
almost like
bewitched all in a line
and sure enough five of them
are just standing there with gaping
holes where their eyes would be
uh the other eight are not that lucky
through the eyeballs the agatha
spider which is kind of hiding behind
these people
has taken eight hands and each one
has two fingers going into their eyes
so the eight hands that were sliced off
of those followers
are poking into the eyes of the people
and sort of there's almost like a a
a stone into a puddle effect as the hand
goes into the eyes and
the eight and the eight none of the 13
people are reacting
uh to what's to the awful thing that is
being done so yes make me a sanity role
when faced with this i keep forgetting
what my sanity is i keep forgetting
where my sanity is
i keep forgetting what my sanity is
the emma story you know what all of that
all of that
breathing that i was doing rolled a four
thank you look at that
birds of paradise coming through all
right well
um it perhaps says more about you than
anything else that
the unholy uh
diorama in front of you only causes
you to lose one sanity
oh and i am super angry
i was like part of me is kind of like
how dare you do that
to a human being part of me is kind of
like how dare you do that to my human
sacrifices
i knew that's where you were going with
that i mean it's a little bit of
this is terrible and it's also a little
you know and i scream get your claws off
of them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and i run up behind the spider head with
my with
alexandria's knife in my hand
uh yeah you know what you have super
speed so yeah you
run up and as you run up
agatha like the agatha head
shifts on the whole spider body and
looks at you
and sorry for the second it's um
something is like something move like
for a second it seems like this thing is
agatha not whatever it now
is and and agatha looks at you and says
remember my words
and then she's back to like creepy
spider things
okay do i i don't get anything else next
round you'll go after her yeah
uh yeah emma you get you are you are
super speedy so you get
first so um
what's next to me with agatha do i get
an ear do i get an eye
like where's where can i it's actually a
horrible
it's a horrible um
you know that weird kind of somehow
wet but still wrinkly like tick kind of
consistency
of dog ticks yeah or deer unfortunately
yes
i do know that is that is the body of
this spider thing
and that is what's next to you and i
don't have access to the head
i don't have access to the egg at the
head you're gonna have to do some
climbing
to get to the ag of the head there
are also
so none of the eight legs this thing has
are touching the ground
it is almost floating or being held by
the eight people that it has its fingers
in
oh so then like i'm gonna get i'm gonna
get in
the i'm gonna climb i'm gonna climb the
spider
all right make me a climb roll
uh spider climbing anything in that's my
time
right
i'm like what's that number oh birds of
pear wait a minute nope that's it that's
only a 35
okay i missed all right so you start to
climb
um it is not a fun climb she's thinking
about inspiration she's looking at
inspiration i can tell
it's 20. it's not like it's worth it the
odds are against me
um so yeah you start you've started
climbing this thing
it's kind of like climbing a um
uh a beanbag chair
full of something gross so
it's not an easy climb and it's it's
definitely slowing you down
you could use the knife to assist me uh
you could do you wish to puncture this
thing
no no no
the way that's phrased no no all right
you start to slowly
you start to slowly climb up you can
do it with the torch because that'll
cauterize as it goes in
so on a very fast
uh not as not emma fast but very fast um
the eight people that this thing has its
hands in
start to talk so
um it's it there's a little like greek
chorus
sort of thing going on as eight
voices all saying the same thing at once
uh and um
[Music]
if you want oh
gosh the situation changed a little all
right so
the voices the eight voices say
you humans and your senseless
desire for survival begin
ah i recognize that way of phrasing
things
and um
yeah that that's that's all the spiders
gonna do this round uh
so donald unless you're gonna use it
doesn't matter because you have the
highest initiative
uh anyway but if you're not gonna use
the firearm this round you're going to
be at your normal initiative not the
ready initiative yeah
all right so you you and alexandra tear
around to the door
you open the door is now open so you
tear around to the door
you see the horrible awful sight in
front of you you both make sanity rules
yeah i
failed that well sure you did that's not
for
all right so alexandra i want you to
sit and think about why that doesn't
disturb you more as you lose two sanity
donald that's dad oh ho donald
donald has a normal reaction you lose
six
sanity sir that's like joan level loss
and so and so
i have a question for you fight flight
or freeze
uh e fight is going to be as does go to
in this kind of situation
that is not going to go well with a
shotgun no he's he's not using the
shotgun with those people in front of
him
um if you're saying fight you're gonna
fight with what you have at hand
you are not in your right frame of mind
you are not making good decisions right
now
this is i'm going to kill everything in
front of me because this is terrifying
i'm going to run away because this is
terrifying or oh my god this is
terrifying i'm going to stay right here
well given those three options i think
his mind
is going to be fine that's what he okay
all right yeah
so uh
you are you are not in your right mind
there is
there are horrors in front of you as
such he's basically going to run towards
the horror is what he will do
okay okay he will run in there with the
shotgun
get it point blank range and
takes the shot as well he just builds
blasting the entire
horrible oh yeah well
it's going yeah it is all it is all
awful okay yeah
so you will you will yeah you
bust through the door alexandra make
me
a make me make me a psychology role
good luck hey
i actually have stuff in this 14. all
right
um donald is not well like you can tell
by the way he charges you know him
and you know that he is running like
that shotgun is at the ready and he's
running towards people
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or what you figure our people
well probably cursing as well the whole
time too
yeah he's he's he's upset yeah
um by the way in the chat they are
suggesting that
large sanity loss should now be called a
joan
yeah i got it i agree i agree
second and third written in stone all
all right a little late to start keeping
track of another stat
but all right um
that was that okay 80s 70s
do i attack though attack roll no cause
you ran
up to the door so you got up to the door
and then you saw this horrible thing
and now you're you're like charging
forward because you want to be at point
like
so next round you will be at point blank
and you can do horrible things
oh did she freeze on us no i don't think
she's okay
i was like oh my god did the internet
freeze
she's going through a mortal freeze
through a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i have two choices in
front of me
you have to cut his achilles tendon it's
the only way to stop him
[Laughter]
if they're like kidneys you have two he
needs both of them to keep up with me
right because they're killer tendons ah
anyway i am not strong enough to
bring donald down
there's just there's no way um
i'm gonna keep pace with him so so that
at the very least if
i see him pointing the gun at a person
i'm gonna like push it in the direction
of this he's pointing the gun at all the
people
yeah i'm not i'm not a fan of this so
i'm just like running to catch up with
him
and just being like the spider head
donald the spider head pointed at that
um so his eyes
are just wide and there's a combination
of
disgust of fear and
um and and just donald's not there right
now
all right so yeah you're you're gonna
you will um
i will say that whatever action he takes
you can have a reaction to
thank you since you're staying with him
all right 70s
uh 60s professor so do i hear any of the
yelling like spider or
yeah you hear yeah you hear donald's
swearing profusely
okay all right so this is not working
this i was hoping this would
get rid of it but i'm not i know i have
a gun now so i'm running
over to no i have a gun now
all right so you're going to start
running to the front
all right also in that initiative
uh
um professor and dr hollister you will
see
um clive like
looking sad and shaking his head and
saying i told him not to look i told him
not to look behind me
and then he starts to walk towards the
front of the of the
um towards the away from the fight
like back into the warehouse oh if i saw
that i would might go after him
okay i'm gonna go after him sure yeah
you're
you're gonna hang around with clive yeah
uh clive will see you
and he'll be like you don't want to be
in there
my friend we got it we got to go we got
look i've got to get to the pyramid so i
can do the cleansing ritual if i stay
here
i'm gonna die and here's the thing
agatha has already told me
and us that the cleansing ritual was
successful
it's the only way i've ever been okay
all right we'll see you out there
probably not
clive heads out clive is he's heading
towards the front
where dr hollister he now comes upon you
and he says look i'm the one that should
leave
maybe you should stay here with your
well i've got something i have to take
care of still
yeah me too all right well maybe i'll
see at the pyramid then i
i don't think so yeah that's the spirit
all right he he will start walking off
into the desert
um but i'm after him right
yes now you go yeah um
as he turns his back to me you should
have put my gun in his back and unload
hachi okay
all right yeah um
successful i mean yeah you will kill him
dead
okay uh
two i hear do i see
do anything you hear you definitely hear
a gunshot at the front
oh crap you hear three here all right
which is a clue as to what might have
happened there's only one
there's only one person you've met that
shoots multiple times
uh yeah you hear blam blam um
and clive like
stands straight up for a second and then
goes
so i didn't see that coming and then
flopped straight forward
okay we're back to
uh a second emma yep
okay so how far am i up the tick agatha
you are you are about a third of the
way
i mean you could attack the body at any
time but if you want to attack the head
you're about a third of the way up
yeah i'm gonna go for the soft bits
uh you're going for the head then yep
okay make me a climb roll
with a climb roll you're there without a
climb roll you're going to keep climbing
what is this number still what is this
with the 37s
i mean it's the ultimate random number
it's a binary thing so we may as well
use the inspiration right yeah as long
as you're not going to
bumble you're going to get 37.
well then well you're either going to
make the role or you're not
or you're going to critically fumble but
the chances of you succeeding are higher
than fumbling if we inspire it
okay i was gonna give you one of mine if
you didn't
oh that's sweet of you i have so many i
have to get rid of them
oh oh
so here's a so this the 10 is actually
so i can't do 2010 i would be it would
be 21 right
no it's 20. no no it's a 20 wait if you
rolled a two
it's a 20 and the 10 right so that's 20.
yeah that's 20.
right yeah as long as yeah as long as
the
it's either a 12 or a 20 yes depending
on which die
yeah so with birds of paradise there's
the 20 and then there's the tens but
there's
just to be clear yeah not with all not
with
good not with the the retail birds of
paradise that was only in
the if you're special against the
birds of paradise you buy from birds of
paradise.com
will not have this issue at all
um but i'm actually enjoying it because
it made me look at it and so that
actually is the zero so i hit it
exactly and i'm gonna check it out yeah
you you you zip up this thing to the
head and now
it's back to first emma okay so first
yep is going to do a reverse
last rites and actually ask for
forgiveness for myself
so you're saying a hail mary as you do
yeah basically instead of asking for you
know for the last rites for
agatha just you know what i mean the
fact that well actually i will i will
ask if she is you know
trying to asking for forgiveness for all
her sins
and that you know may god accept her
into the kingdom of heaven and blah blah
blah blah
and then stab her right now send her to
the kingdom of heaven
okay i don't know alexandria can
roll for me because i don't know what to
do i will happily roll for you because
i almost can't fail but i don't i don't
have the knife in my hand
so the base knife skill is i think
there isn't there isn't a base knife
skill is a thing i took i took knife as
a special fighting style
right well perhaps the 25 oh i call it
25 what the heck
so you have a base 25 it's better than
your climb
yeah it is i was about to say because
i'm like my sword is like a 38
but i'm that's not a sword yeah my like
if only you were drunk exactly
i might be so yeah even the daggers are
come on
[Music]
nope oh thank god that's a 63. so it
didn't make it but for a second i
thought it wasn't fine
so you like you come around and you're
like um
you realize that you made the rookie
mistake of trying to slice the throat of
something that doesn't have a throat
um and so you like cut across the throat
thinking
maybe she'll bleed she does not bleed
at least there isn't like acid goo
coming out of her god knows what
it's true at least there's not all
right
that was first emma all right donald
with a readied firearm you know
he's he's he's crazy i'm gonna run up
all the way as close i can get the
spider creature and they want to
point blank range fire unless somebody
stops me let's have you
no yeah okay alexandra you have a
chance you see the shotgun raising up
is he pointing at the people or is he
pointing at the agatha head
i meant yes my mind i got the head but
the people are in front of it so
whatever
is there by running up to point blank
he's essentially aiming at everything
and it's a shotgun
so and also emma's on the on
you know sorry all right um
i'm gonna do the thing that i did not
want to do and i'm gonna try to knock
him over
all right this will be a strength roll
for you
based and against his thighs so this is
an opposed strength
you essentially are going to try and uh
shoulder check him
yeah basically what i'm aiming at is
almost almost like a flying tackle
because i'm coming up alongside him and
like grabbing him around the hips to
knock him down
all right i'm gonna make doing a rock
pick and just bouncing off of him
i'm gonna make you an offer you can make
this a
fight brawl role but you're gonna do
damage
to him if and that will be opposed by
his fight brawl
or you can try to just sort of shoulder
check him and bump him
and that's gonna be a strength versus
size role your choice
about the same size aren't we 65 is his
size he's tough
uh i mean i'm a 60 just a little bit
more very close but it's
yours isn't your strength not your size
i'm trying i'm trying to gauge what i'm
up against but
my brawl is bad so i'm gonna go for uh
strength versus size
okay all right so donald make a string a
size roll alexandra make a strength roll
can i inspire mine
uh mr inspiration on my role please are
you trying to miss it
yes
otherwise it's otherwise it's a critical
success so i'd rather miss this role
all right alexandra ought one oh i think
well let me i'm
i said this i roll a critical success i
have to no so
so in the like the the defender
the attacker has to beat the defender
and you both have a critical success i
want to spend inspiration on my role
though so can we do that
let's inspire that to make it worse sure
why not
that's a sentence i never thought i'd
say i know 17 but that's not a
critical success that's all right
yes so yeah she will um
alexander make me a luck role boy
come on come on
all right yeah so the shotgun goes off
up into the sky there's like a blam as
it shoots up and misses everything
um and donald make me a sanity role
another one yes actually make
let's make it an intelligence role let's
make it an intelligence all right uh
that's a fail okay yeah you have not
come to your senses yet
yeah there there's a horror in front of
you and please [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] inspire that
how much do we oh goodness we don't have
that much but you know we
had 12 so 63 is a success so yeah
right so so you are you are
cognizant that
what you were going to do would have
hurt
but that's the extent of what you're
cognizant of okay you're still
in a fighting rage because there is a
horror in front of you
so that was 70s 60s professor lamb
i heard shots you heard shots at the
front yes uh
yeah yeah so i'm gonna i heard shots in
the front and over there correct
a shotgun just went off in the in the
office
there were three gunshots in the front
but i know that holly was that way so
i'm gonna
and i know that those guys okay so i'm
gonna go after holly i'll see what
happened to holly
so you come running up and uh
hollister is standing at the open
door
next to the bleeding profusely body
of professor clive
oh my god what happened holly would he
was gonna go do the
agatha couldn't agatha couldn't see what
happened at the pyramid
she couldn't see she couldn't tell him
that
how did you know he killed her and he
wait are you saying that you did this
what he was doing wasn't gonna work it
was gonna stop us from succeeding
no how the hell did you know that
because agatha
couldn't see the ritual she couldn't see
it
so someone else was telling him that
that would work
and someone else was telling us not to
guess at who without was
he was under his control
okay all right there there i look
there's nothing i can do for this guy
he's oh he's quite dead
he's our friends are still back there
but
let's go let's go find out what's going
on we'll deal with this later all right
that was 60s and it'll be
i'm going to go after don julio get the
we we just need to get out of here get
the others get the people get them out
i'm going to grab some supplies from the
back of the truck and i'm going to go in
the tunnel
we just need to leave this place we're
wasting time here
wait you can't go after them by yourself
you got
you've lost too much time already don't
don't don't tell me that
no
we we don't have any time for this crap
all right
fine you want to go by yourself you go
i'm going to go after my friends
tell them to get out of there no i'm
going to tell them what you did
you fine
and all right hollister will start to
walk
out of the front door no i'm gonna grab
a crate of the supplies
from the back i'm gonna get some food
and water
okay the truck that i'm gonna okay but
you're not taking the truck
no okay okay uh
second emma okay i'm gonna go
so i learned my lesson don't
don't stab don't slit a throat of a
spider
and also don't try slitting with a
stiletto they're stabbing daggers
yeah so that's what i want to do is i'm
looking for a gooey spot
i mean let me take that back i'm how do
i even put this i'm looking for
i don't even know where would the spider
brain be
like i mean i've seen alexandria enough
to know like going through like the
ocular socket or through the ear would
be a good way to like
i'm assuming agatha still has a head
it's still the head of agatha
so like if i'm in the back i would then
just
come to the side and stab earth through
the ears into the brain
okay montage alexander killing lots of
really want to know how often i don't
even know how often emma's paid
attention about alexandria stabbing
people
because i feel like that's an
interesting answer um
so make me a make me a knife roll
oh this is not great that's a 60 60 10
so that would be 60.
inspiring we're going gonna keep rolling
those tens oh speaking of which 6010
elder brat gave us a thousand bits
thank you oh thank goodness oh here they
are i put them right here so i'm gonna
use one of those
20 mm 29.
so that's four you could spend a lot
i mean and for luck you can't i mean
i'm an advocate for this but i can't
remember
yeah you can't yeah i think inspiring
once
yeah i gotta go luck and stab her in the
ear and this is everything i got
what you just spent all your luck i
know i spent four luck oh you were
really hopeful there
uh all right you you yeah you stab
there's a there's a satisfying question
mark
crunch as you stab through uh
the skull of agatha and um
[Music]
you stab the knife through and there's
something there that you
you stab into and when you pull the
knife out
and then eyeballs start to light and a
few eyeballs roll
out
and you start to wonder what is in the
but
and yeah there is so yeah there is there
is now
a a a very human eyeball
on the end of your stiletto and the head
but the hands stay in the eye sockets of
the eight people
none of the 13 innocent peop 12 innocent
people have moved
this whole time so
as soon as you so yeah you stab in the
thing you pull it out
and the head
like you hit it with such force that the
head kind of
and is now at this ugly angle and it's
almost
like looking at you and the eight
the eight voices um
the the eight voices will say fine
you want them so much come and get them
and the um
the body of this spider starts to
deflate
and you feel almost like um
water running through pipes
you see like blobs of something going
through the the arms
the eight arms and through the hands
into the people and as you're watching
the people
start to turn into sand
and as they turn into sand you hear
uh the the eight voices again
uh saying i think you know
where to find us and then the dust just
blows away
and then after that i take the knife
with the eyeball on the end of it and
oh nice did you succeed in like knocking
donald over
or yeah no no you just knocked the
shotgun okay
so i'm just like standing there looking
up and then like
this dagger appears in front of me
because she's still at super speed
um so donald the the horror
that was in front of you has dissolved
so you start to like you know come out
of this
um there are still four people standing
in front of you
standing totally stock still with no
eyes
i think i just at this point he just got
screamed out and rage throw his shotgun
down
it does he's kind of i think it's empty
yeah he's just gonna be just lost at
this point
i'll probably grab on to alexandria um
bury his head into his shoulder and just
try to
control his rage basically yeah okay
gentlier than you really wish kind of
ride this dissolving spider thing down
to the ground
um and you you land on the ground and
you see the five
uh four the four other people
uh just they're still standing there
stock still
uh and you see professor lam come
busting through the door
and professor lam what do you do i
couldn't say
oh i just go what what
holly he he just killed clive what
oh what's going on in here
damn it i see sand on the ground and
then
yeah there's people sand on the ground
there's a knife there's an eyeball knife
lollipop and
it's actually when you when you take a
second to look around you see
five people with no four people damn
it
i had to change my numbers and it's
really thrilled i actually had to go
back in my notes and change it from five
to four
four people so make me a sanity roll for
that
yay
oh no i got a 90. 90's not a fumble
i know but i was i thought it was for
one second
and and yeah
so we're gonna come out of initiative uh
dr hollister i'm gonna come to you for a
second
you are what what are you gonna do
uh i was getting the food and water
yeah you're walking but but more
importantly
where is my where is my where are my
medical supplies are they back in the
room or do i have those with me
you have those with you okay yeah then
i'm i'm
not like hauling because i don't i i
figure it's gonna be
keep a fast pace but don't burn myself
out until i catch up with
the dawn and so you're going into the
tunnel
yes okay the tunnel that seems to
lead towards the pyramid
okay no problem yeah so you will
um you will come around the side of the
warehouse
that you were in and go into the other
warehouse where that um
trap door led down to the basement that
had been carved
open by the doors and i reload my gun
sure yeah as you're like yeah once you
get in the second warehouse you like put
everything down and you very carefully
like
you know you reload everything sure okay
uh we will cut back to um
our heroes question mark and
uh you are uh
uh yeah you are in in this room and
um about two minutes of professor lam
telling you what just happened
the people start to come out of whatever
happened to them
and the first thing that happens is
you hear a woman
and i just swear under my breath
i don't know what to do i don't know
what we do with this i don't
know is someone there
yep we're right here so i grab i grab
all the followers together
like i i'm like here you hold hands i we
won't get lost if you we all hold hands
the great evil is upon us and it has
taken your sight
it has taken some of the members of the
flock and we must continue on to defeat
this
it won't stop until it tries to destroy
us all
oh my a couple of them will like do the
sign of the cross when you say the great
evil and stuff like that
and they're like oh we understand we
understand
um do we are we going to be able to see
again
perhaps perhaps
no that's actually like the least and
like
they seem very uns unsatisfied with
perhaps
i mean but they're not sure i mean
i made a collective sand roll and they
seem to be doing all right so
cool so i'm working to gather all of
them
together calm them like go over
the fact that we need to stick together
and hold hands and move together as a
group
and that we will am i listening to what
joan is yelling about
whatever yeah you hear it you hear all
this stuff yeah
yeah well she's doing that i see donald
and alexandria you know and i
just go over there guys guys guys guys
guys guys guys
we have no time john i need you to what
what is it
mercy both of you need to calm down and
take a breath
no we have no time you're about to fly
into pieces and those people over there
are about to lose it
it doesn't matter we have enough we need
them
take a break and then tell me what's
going on okay
all right all right so
so all right i tried to to get rid of
the big symbol outside because it the
blood and everything i thought would
help
um wreck what was going on but didn't
seem to help dr holler
dr hollister was trying to get out of
here he was opening the doors he was
trying so he could get the truck out
and then clive said that he was gonna
go
and and do the ritual himself and he
said he didn't need help it was going to
be fine because
agatha said it was fine so i told him to
go
the next thing i know i hear three shots
and holly shot him
sean he killed him
it got to holly he said he was going to
go
uh down the hole wait wait dr hollis is
shot clive
killed clive and then where is he
where's the doctor
he took off i i came back to help you
guys because i heard your shots
so i came back to help you guys and said
forget him we don't have enough time for
that
we have to come over and i have to get
you guys so we can go and do what we
need to do
where is hollister going and how is he
getting there he did i didn't hear the
he he he said he was going down the hole
oh god though you don't you
said that on the whole he said that all
of this was
all of this was was not real and that
they were we were getting told lies
and that that clive wasn't going to help
us anyway and so he was going to help us
he went down the hole right he was going
crazy
why did he say that that um
how how did he know it wasn't going to
work what did he say
he said that agatha couldn't see the
ritual
i guess who couldn't see they kept
saying how good couldn't see the rituals
she they said she can't see anything to
do with the black
pharaoh she could
so she couldn't tell that the ritual was
going to happen you wouldn't be able to
know that the ritual would work
what what oh wait wait clive turned her
into the spider
is what you're sent telling me we know
that
don't we yeah yeah but holly holly's
saying that it's it was done by
it wasn't just clive clyde was being led
astray
because agatha couldn't see it so
somebody else was talking instead of
that the black feral messes with people
goes into people we just we just we just
saw it
we just i don't i think hollister is
saying i think hollister knows what he's
doing
crap crap crap crap crap crap crap i've
got
the people by the hand and they're nice
and calm
yep i was about to say and we're gonna
go now into the truck
and we're gonna go find my good friend
don julio who's gonna help us rid the
world of evil because he has that
power he is quite an amazing exorcist
he can exercise anything
evil in the desert right this way ladies
and gentlemen like i now turn into like
like a cruise director i was like right
this way ladies and gentlemen to the
back of the truck to become a cruise
director
they they rolled an 09 on their
on their collective sand rolls so
they're like yeah okay
i mean you can't see anything what's
wrong nothing
i've heard of cardinal don julio so
but he's here that holly went after him
in the hole
right you went after him down down the
tunnel then
i want to sit down i don't want to walk
hurled in the truck and stuff listen to
john they've got
they've got no eyes don't matter what's
in the trunk
shut up donal
[Laughter]
wait what did was he speaking
metaphorically
absolutely and i pull out some rand i
was going to look for this before i
started this show but like i was going
to look for the blind cannot see in the
like somebody who's actually religious
please fill in the blanks for the bible
make me a religion role it's wonderful
oh actually i do have some of this
i mean i could what did you what
i act like i actually oh hachimachi as
ezra would say
um out of 63 oh my god it's almost an
extreme success
and my extreme would be 12 and i rolled
a 13.
very nice so yeah you you have a
perfect scripture ordained here about
you know someone dealing with
blindness and
you know crosses they have to bear and
all this stuff and they're just like
of course yes and they are following you
you know they are happy to follow you
uh religion is such a useful right well
i
i i know i'm not going to make it that
long i just everything's crumbling
around us
let's just go now let's just go
where are we going to the pyramids
paulister is by himself in the tunnels
we
we can't we can't do this we can leave
him
he he i'm not i'm not going to
what are you saying you're going to make
me
help the guy to kill clive
i i think he's the only same person in
the whole party entirely possible all
right it sounds it sounds like
it sounds like in order to get the
people to the pyramid we're gonna need
to split up
what what alex what are you saying
i hate i hate the sentence we're gonna
have to split up
um they're gonna need someone with them
who can defend them
donal right
what are you saying i'm saying that you
need to go with them and i'm going to
follow hollister into the tunnel
i don't i i disagree i think we all go
if one goes we all go or we all take the
truck
emma's right these people are more
important the doctor i respect the
doctor these people are more important
we have to get them safely there
i was like oh that's the best of both
worlds i get to ride
and to go in the hole i don't suppose
there's any bikes here
there but how big are these dolls in
joan you can
ignore me i'm not here i am i'm i'm not
leaving i hear
dr hollister's voice in my head i am not
leaving hollister by himself in
in those tunnels so either either you
let me go
and take the rest of the people in the
truck where we're going but we need to
the doctor is on his own course this is
more important this our mission is with
emma
and these people but he said he was
after who dawn don julio
because don julio is the exorcist who
will clean all evil from a space
hey look best of both worlds we don't
have to deal with five anymore
we just have to deal with don julio who
doesn't like us
yep exactly i mean i might not make it
but
i'm gonna take a swig out of my little
like flask i'm like hey i might not make
it but whatevs
he actually agrees with you but he feels
that you're the evil that he is
cleansing from the earth
exactly alex let's stay with these
people
um hollister will be fine he'll find
that crazy
exorcist fella they'll meet us at the
pyramids
we'll just title this episode hollister
will be fine
speaking of which scott parsons
spoo i don't know how do you say that
scott par p-a-r-s-o-n
how would you say that he's from pacific
state university
him yeah that's him and what's his
name the little blond guy
god maybe i am going senile wasn't
pacific state university that horrible
80s
like school comedy with david spade
what is that the little blog anyway
there's a thousand for hollister to
hopefully survive oh there we go
apparently portland state university
not pacific state but i bet you was
probably that university was probably
based off portland
because he went to roadside
he's on the road he's a rhodes scholar
they tried to make it sound like the
supreme court nominee they called her a
rhodes scholar because she went to like
rhodes state university or something
like rhode island university yeah
she's a rhodes scholar um
all right god i am so torn at this
point because riding in the truck would
be cool but
going after holly they've convinced me
that he knows what he's doing
and also you said there's something in
the back i'm gonna say this quietly so
the people don't hear it
there's something in the back of that
truck it was
pretty disgusting for a while there's
lots of blood and vomit
i'm
[Laughter]
we'll clean the truck don't go down
there
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] shoot shoot we're running out of
time guys we're
running out of time are we i thought we
had like two days what day is it
it is the afternoon of june
4th okay no matter what no matter what
jonah's going to be screaming okay
screaming
i mean joan we have 24 hours to get
to the middle of the desert i forgot
last how last time did it take us like a
half a day to get out there
it takes like four hours yeah yeah
that's nothing
no my body is falling apart as we speak
and we have
no time speaking of having no time
we're gonna go to break so what i was
like what hang on
so we're gonna do another giveaway here
at the break
we are actually we're gonna be
giving away a copy of the second edition
uh a pdf copy of the second edition of
harlem unbound
which i've talked about it greatly so
i won't talk about much more but is
one of i think the best rpg
supplements ever written it's uh
it's it's great not just for the
uh not just for the the actual subject
matter which is
talking about role playing in harlem in
1920s new york which is fascinating
but also for the way that it it it
gives
players and gm's ways to deal with
tough material in a game and i i i
i have found like i've read that chapter
several times i think it's
it's it's really i believe at the
time i used the
the erudite review word it was
revelatory uh

we will be back just as soon as six
people can use six bathrooms

welcome back internet friends




so we have a
a a little montage of dr hollister
starting to walk down this dark cave
with a torch and a small crate of food and like sad
hulk music playing as he you know as

i'll be able to help you in the desert
we'll need you if something happens in
in
in those tunnels i can help hollister
and he's the safest of us at the moment
don't don't do it
i'm not i'm not doing well i'm like
something like this happened to me i
i need i need you to stay with us stay

rest of the supplies that we've got
you know what we saved from the boat at
least luckily emma is doing a good
job of keeping the four people
calm yeah i was like i'm loading them
into the back of the truck so they can't

they're busy shuffling and doing
whatever they're not hearing that these
people are gonna die part of the
conversation

i don't think he knew that he was being
played i think he should we should talk
to him or something
not just kill them maybe sometimes
sometimes you have to make that decision
in a split second and
live with the consequences it's not easy
no well then if you guys think he made
the right decision i should go after him
john what can you do down there those
tunnels
god knows what made those tunnels what's
strange well i have a crowbar
and you know exactly what made those
tunnels
we don't know you i don't know you know
that
joan i i can hold my own down there if i
absolutely had to
you're not you don't have the same
training that i do and we need you
i think we need you for the ritual john
i'm the only one that can do this if
hollister doesn't doesn't make it we
need to have someone who knows what
they're doing with
all of this which isn't me
okay okay all right don't you have
something to help him in your book
what was what was the book
a song of the doll whatever that book
was about send in the dolls um
the the s it was they're
yeah don't you have something in the
what what what's in the books that my
what's in the book that might help him
i don't know i don't read the books
anymore
i don't read the books anymore books
books clive has books we need to get all
of his books
he might have more stuff in the books
so i'm going to do that that's what i'm
going to do you guys getting ready i'm
going to grab
any books and anything he's got so the
books apparently clive was sleeping
in the truck and so the books are
there's like a a small
box a little chest that has you know
seven
books in it that perfectly what he has
left
alaziz as well are you gonna like
go through the books joan yes okay
i can't tell if i want you to succeed or
fail this one
61 yes that makes it okay oh jeez you
got luck lady
i do make me a cthulhu mythos role
i'm like i was gonna grab the
inspiration i was like no
you've got the most of that of anyone in
this group i think
i think so
no i don't make it right yeah you think
there are a number of tone you don't
you're not recognizing anything offhand
um you are
not seeing that copy you would recognize
the necronomicon
gotcha but you you think there are a
number of titles here that would be
very interesting okay yeah i don't think
we have enough time for me to go digging
through all of his stuff but this here
this is it i'll ke i'll read these on
our way out okay
and and while she's digging through that
i remember that that she said that uh
hollister
killed clive and so i'm gonna go and
like look for the body i imagine it's in
our way i'd like to get it out of our
way
okay yeah you you run ups to the front
uh and you see a pool of blood
a trail of bloody footprints heading off
into the desert
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i'm i'm i'm going to take off
running
after after those bloody footprints do i
see you're going
yeah you see alexandra just take off
running into
the desert apparently all right i'm
going to get out of stop what i'm doing
i'm chasing after her all right so uh
emma and joan
take the keys i i can't drive i can
drive should we just
go are we all are we all ready i mean i
think we are
i guess so i mean most of the supplies
were already in the truck so it's pretty
much the people
and you know yep so we usher them in and
i give joan the keys i'm like i can't
drive get in
all right i can drive okay oh can we
drive real slow
and just watch the action like this from
it's probably safer yeah
uh all right so no i'll we'll go after
all right are you gonna try and um
drive i mean you'll you'll definitely
catch up with alexandra
and donal fairly quickly um
are you going to try and like zoom are
you going to drive this truck
out it's you're going to be off-roading
it
so you can drive i'm thinking and
cautiously
okay i cautiously because i you know i
don't know if i want to catch up to them
no and i'm going to yell slow down
because they can't see
i've got weak kidneys or whatever you
know i can't i can't deal with the
bouncing around right now
i've got weak kidneys or whatever but we
got to get to them we got to pick them
up we gotta get
like i said you will get to alexandria i
need my teeth and my mouth
i can't like be bouncing around like a
crazy person in this truck
slow down all right so
um alexander mcdonald the truck comes
groaning out of the warehouse
and quickly bears yelling slow down
and and quickly bears down on both
of you
i'll i'll note that and just keep moving
following the track the the trail of
bloody okay
the truck so the truck is going to
basically like you're gonna like pull up
next to them and you'll get in right
yeah so the truck like pulls up next to
you and yell and you know jones like get
in
i've kept moving oh crap
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] want us to wait for you here just
just keep running like i'm not even
worried about the logistics of it at the
moment i'm just like
this this needs to end this needs to end
now okay so
uh you are joan you're becoming
acutely aware that you are not on a road
and you are just driving like you've
you've now uh
after about two minutes of them moving
forward you've left
the city and you are now just heading
into the desert
i don't know if i can keep truck
sand no idea
we're we lost you a little bit there
ah i keep getting these flickers
yeah okay i was getting these flickers
like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
i don't know if i can keep on the i
don't know if i can keep this the sand i
don't want to have to pull this thing
out of the sand
emma what should we do well then let's
wait see where alexandria goes
and then go or actually you know what
wait let me see what's in the back of
the truck
yeah let's i'm just gonna wait right
here we're gonna stop for a second uh
so what are you looking for so being
in new york i know what it's like to
i mean i don't drive but i see the cars
like slipping around
so well like what do they do when they
get stuck in the snow
yeah cat litter yeah that too but
like you put some
you know what i mean like you put
something underneath or something that
will let you get out yes
yes
exactly so it looks like
um yeah you find
a it looks like there's a there's
definitely a spade yeah there's a
there's a spade there that that seems
they used to dig
uh stuff we have crates we can the
most part it looks like this truck was
dry it was like not made to drive in the
sand
damn it we're gonna have to wait
i can't afford to go any farther and
then just kind of hit me up
we're gonna have to feed the people in
the back too yeah we're gonna have to
well is there someplace around here that
looks we're in the desert i know it's
not
how far back was the last shade or
shelter type thing so i mean there's
there's
on the outskirts of town you're about
two minutes out of town
and that's about where the trees stop
so let's find let's go back go under a
tree wait for them to come back
mm-hmm okay you can't do oh are we there
no not yet we're gonna stop for a break
in a minute like pound on the back
all right um
all right so donald and alexandra
uh you head out into the desert
uh it is it is not hard to follow
these tracks
um but you don't have a sense of how
long
uh you know how sort of what kind of a
head start
um the blood seems to stop pretty early
and now you're just following footprints
how long ago did it did we did we hear
it was like because joan came back very
shortly after
um hollister killed clive
it's true there was you know there
was a
she came back very quickly but you
stayed in that room for a while there
was also some philosophical discussions
about
our you know will we won't we that sort
of thing
got a whole lot of talk about muffins
what do you think he's got a 15-20
minute lead on us but he's wounded but
the blood stops what do you think he's
moving slower than we are
so you neither of you yeah neither of
you
according to joan he's not wounded he's
dead right but he's up and walking and i
just i have to accept that that's the
case
because we've seen weirder we've seen
weirder at this point
yeah i think the first assumption is he
just survived i don't know how
well either either he survived or he's
being driven
let's find out the second one is much
worse
do we see any mountains any rocks
anything in front of us that you might
be hiding
there there there's sand dunes like the
you see
stretching off about a quarter mile
you see the footprints going up a sand
dune and then cresting
and presumably going over okay
just take off and take off in that
direction more trotting now than running
because
it's hard to maintain as a sprint so
you're in the desert
in the heat of the afternoon yeah and
um the truck has left you behind the
truck is not following anymore
um once you're over the rise of this you
will be out of sight of the truck
yep and
okay so you you crest the rise
and you immediately notice that whatever
your clive your he like fell
down the front of these dunes and then
the
steps start again up the next dune
all the tracks appear to still be fresh
the wind hasn't washed them away so
we're still
we should be close to them they still
have time and just and just like
run slide down the side of the down the
side of the of the dune like like take a
couple of steps and then just like slide
down a bit
i used to do that down down hills all
the time where i would have run half
slide uh
yeah all right so you you continue this
for about
10 minutes and then you
uh you you crest a rise and
um you come into like a valley and as
you
you see that once again clive fell
down this thing and then at the bottom
it almost looks like an ant lion sort of
thing there's like a
pit in the sand oh no
i'm going to approach that very slowly
careful
like testing testing each step before i
take it all right yeah you're coming
down
you know you're being careful but you
are coming down an incline that is very
slippery so
um it is it seems like again when
when when the decline hits the flat
that's where that kind of weird pit is
okay i'm going to aim a little bit to
the side of it so that if i do slip
i don't go rolling into the into the
i was i'm being just just careful yeah
yeah
uh somebody doesn't know it so an ant
lion
is an insect they they dig a little
pit in the sand and ants fall into it
and can't get out and they slowly
fall down
and then the antlion eats them just call
it a sarlacc pit they know what that
means
yeah true everyone knows what a sarlacc
pick and pit is not
who knows what ant lion is come on it's
first of all it's like the coolest
i don't know why they i mean i don't
know where the lion comes from not a lot
of lions are digging pits and waiting
for things not really
maybe it's the wide open mouth thing oh
yeah
um oh sorry
no the cream that might be the queen it
doesn't go well for the male praying
mantises
it's true so
you yeah you come down and again
there's like a
a gentle kind of pit in the sand
that definitely comes to a specific
point
lean and very careful very carefully
over to look
all right so you you pop your head over
at the the the at the point at the apex
of the i guess that would be the would
that be the perigee i don't know what
the
at the at the at the point of the pit
um is the half blown is the
is the head sticking out of the sand
of dr henry clive with a large chunk
blown out of one side of it
just the head i mean that you can see
the rest of the body perhaps beneath the
sand could be yeah
probably hopefully i just don't
well that's that's why you're here with
the gun yes i'll put the pistol out i'll
take careful aim
to take a turn for game purposes no no
you you will you
you are a killer so yeah you fire
um and you hit you hit the head
and blow another chunk off of it and um
there seems to be no reaction i'll take
a couple more shots to see if it changes
anything
uh all right yeah you we are horrible
people
you blow yeah you you blow
several holes in clive's head there is
no reaction at all
okay i'm gonna look around to see if
there's any indication of
i mean we just saw a head without the
rest of the body
i'm gonna look around to see if there's
any indication of something similar
going on
here where like the rest of the body
walked off or something
no you don't see any more tracks it does
i mean it does seem like
that head is you know it's not just his
head it's his whole body
submerged okay well then
well let's just say he's dead and call
the day
sounds good to me and pray to god it
doesn't come back to bite us in the eyes
okay i gotta help help you out so we
don't slip into this mess
yeah it's at that point the
earthquake starts i wasn't worried about
it
uh and so the first thing that
happens is you notice
that like sand starts to like pour down
the side
and it starts to like hit clive's
the the you know the remains of clyde's
head
and the clive body
um yeah sure
uh so yeah i will make you guys make a
roll the but the clive body
does the or the head does like a cork
okay whatever what whatever it was in is
going
down pulling all the yeah
uh and both of you makes me dex rolls
yeah at least we're good at that
[Music]
success hard success yeah no problem
yeah you're both
you easily dance out of the way the pit
gets a little larger but not too much
larger
all right well is it one of those
is it whatever made those tunnels oh
that's right that's those stories about
those things that create the dig the
tunnels on the ground what were those
called
those those things that i wish a person
in the party had told us more about
whatever those it must be one of those
creatures it must be
all right let's let's get out of here
yeah let's go back and start like hiking
up the side of the side of the dune
sure yeah so emma
and joan they're gone about a half an
hour
um and you finally see them trudging
back from a ways away
okay so i yell out the window we're
running out of time
no i mean joan we're we've got bigger
problems than out of time our
fast moving and again i'm using this
loosely fast moving vehicle
um won't go in the sand what do we do
there is i mean i mean there's a road
there a pat there's a path
to the pyramids yes okay good it's just
that
following the following the tracks of
clive would not have gotten you there
okay random yeah but there's a
okay so we're good there's a path like
the trucking do you know
do you remember how to get there sort of
i'm going to follow the path do i i was
like hang on let me roll for
you know what it's not a so it's not an
idea before i trust you
you essentially i mean you essentially
know
okay okay good so we can get them in the
truck
and then we can go we still have plenty
of time yep
yep okay and we'll get there in the
morning and hopefully
actually you'll get there so it's about
you'll get there about
nine o'clock at night is that a good
time to get there like i don't want to
get there right when the action's
happening
what just whose action are we all in the
truck again
yeah yes yes okay you guys have gotten
to the truck and now
now you're deciding when we're going to
go well i'm assuming clive's alive
and he's going to still do
or somebody's doing the ritual i don't
want to be there just in case
nope clive's dead as a climb into the
truck
clive's dead something underneath under
the sand devoured it
devoured it it was it was inside of a
like pit thing
and then there was an earthquake and it
started corkscrewing under
the ground this now is that something i
would have read about in the book about
the dholes that they do
no nothing like that okay i just i i
mean if she mentions the earthquake part
that definitely sounds
what we should do when we make it to the
pyramid and
um all the guardians the protectors the
children of the black pharaoh
are there that's what i'm saying is that
we don't want to like
go very fast but we also need to make
sure that something you know i mean we
need to make sure that don julio is like
cleanse the area i mean somebody needs
to make sure that he's able to do it and
he knows what to do
he's going to meet us there then no i
don't know what is happening
that crazy man gets on the boat yells
something crazy
blah blah blah all of a sudden we're on
fire and then we're up at the ceiling or
i don't know
i'm flying in the air and then i don't
know
i have no idea why the exorcist i hear i
hired who found out i was evil
is mad at me oh whoa whoa i'm not saying
i'm evil
i'm just saying there might be a problem
here with you and i donal you were on
fire
what happened to us i mean we we
survived what happened
i just i can't take any more exorcisms
that's all i'm saying
right all right but we need to make sure
that it actually happens which means
that either correct
we drive out there now or we follow my
idea and i go out
through the tunnel to make sure that
things happen let's drive out there
though
and then i drive back just in case i
might die because of the exorcism
i mean just just just stay out of his
if he doesn't know you're there maybe
he'll be more focused on all of the evil
that's there
maybe he already exercised the evil from
you and you're fine now maybe you're an
innocent
rest of them i'm sorry i didn't mean to
i say we take the truck out there
and we stay far enough back
that we're not gonna be in the ring
around
like fourth of july fireworks exactly
we'll just find a like a spot on a hill
watch it all happen and we can stay in
the truck and the truck will
protect us from things i like that the
normal things
yeah fine there's normal things the
normal things
so you're okay with pulling up about 9
p.m
let's do it okay dr
hollis that or spend another or spend a
night in that warehouse and i am
so against this idea it actually
physically hurts we gotta go we gotta go
all right dr hollister yes
so you are walking down
a alarmingly
uniform 25 foot diameter
round tunnel
um i'm going a bit faster than walking
because he's got a head start on me
yeah but yeah it was it was unnatural
when i first saw it
about 10 minutes of being down
here
it's nice and cool that's a nice thing
uh
you hear you hear
noise up ahead
yeah i'm gonna continue up ahead against
all better judgment
it's it's a rumbling noise
um
yeah i mean do i see anything i mean
it's unifor
the tunnel's uniform right there's no
other tunnels
nope this is a north
i mean this is a north-south ish thing
and you're heading in the direction
towards the pyramid
god help me there you go that hasn't
worked yet
uh so um
so yeah you come up and you see
uh somebody
you you hear a voice that
i don't think you recognize i was i was
in yeah i was there for the uh
for the the first exorcism when emma was
floating up
uh so this is a different voice okay um
but as the as the you hear a
uh um
as you're coming up with a gun and a and
a uh
a torch out so you're putting down the
supplies
yeah okay you put down the crate of
supplies
and you come forward and you see a
a sad sight you see um
the duchess uh
like slumped against the wall and
the the horrible rumming that you
rumbling you heard
and standing next to her like
as you're coming up uh
is is tidwell and he like kind of
emerges out of the shadows
as tidwell does and uh
and says oh
it's you sir please do not
uh too much to unpack here
yes he took one look at the mistress
and said he didn't have time for that
and continued on
well it was sentiment but i
i have to be going too you guys
should get out of here
this is the way that you're going is
just fyi i'm gonna run back and get my
supplies
of course once the madame has
returned to her senses we will
decide where to go
okay all right all right you run back
and he has already like
gone back into the shadows he
apparently is like
uh concealing himself behind the duchess
um and you continue on uh
just about as you're starting to slow
down from your pace almost an hour
it's been you've been going for a while
um you're very glad
that this thing is is cool you hear
like you definitely hear someone up
ahead of you
and you hear like um
who's that who's there it's
it's
i don't know if we we formally met my
uh if i recall correctly
you might need some medical attention
god hasn't been coming through for me as
yeah and it's my understanding
uh i have another reason here it's not
completely altruistic
[Music]
um
of course my my faith is a weapon
and i'll start treating him why while
i'm talking right he has an
ugly knot on his head from being
knocked unconscious
from being a a pistol whipped
with a rifle i didn't probably have like
a cold piece of iron or something to put
against it or
sure yeah yeah yeah water
yeah and um
oh let's hear it for insane people he
does not seem to recognize you
and he's definitely like when you when
you get close and you start treating him
he seems like old and feeble and
you know getting getting cracked across
the skull was not great for him
well just here let's let's rest
really quickly i'll give him some food
and water
and then i'll pick out some of the buck
shot that landed in me after i've taken
care of him
sure yeah but
do you do you know where you're going
right now you're headed towards the
and as it just so happens there's a
great evil there that needs to be
exercised
if you're willing to do that i will do
for someone who doesn't believe in the
itself
then yes lead
follow let's go all right and yeah
after after we've gotten a little bit of
rest i'll uh
i'll let him up put his arm around his
shoulder and yeah
he's definitely moving slower than you
are
he seems you know again there's a sense
of
you know sort of how kind of
old and and weak he is so he's light i'm
hearing that he's light
he is light yes um
so yeah you guys will continue on and
basically you're gonna
walk for
a long time yep we'll take breaks
too yeah so you will get there
not that you know they're getting there
but you know just to give everybody a
relative sense of time
it's gonna be well let's see make me
a luck roll
i'm looking over my shoulder being like
i'm sure one of them
i told joan that you know if someone
wanted to follow me i'm not hearing any
footsteps
no that's that's a 95 no matter how i
look at it but all right
so you will be under the pyramid at
out of that of thinking that you'd been
controlled and possessed that's the best
i got for you man
uh so not that you'll be a warrior under
the pyramid but it will be about
midnight all right so
you you guys
have pulled onto a a a hill
man everybody wants to know about that
orion express game you don't
i'm just saying somebody who's mad at
somebody else for a while
i'm sorry i'm sorry
no you didn't die from me exactly that's
what i'm saying
why should i what don't you remember
thomas killed me he turned never mind
anyway
i thought you're talking about i
injected you full of stuff
at that one time and then betrayed
everyone
she said it was almost a marriage
breaker you're not married to her yeah
i mean that's your thing whatever i mean
the flamingo that was one of the
highlights
of yeah a lot of people died but
it was pretty epic i i
handful of bourbon not died i got thrown
out of a train with the ham fl glass
full of bourbon
i still say that i'm never going to end
there's never going to be a better end
to a scenario
that's right you are really fuzzy my
friends
i can't i have to like put the little
box on the ground
it's weird to sit so far away but there
you go all right so
we'd find a better ending i just want to
throw that out there oh we wanted to
if emma's playing there's no way
uh so yeah you you guys pull
you you pull up on a bluff kind of
overlooking the pyramids
uh and it seems like
sure yeah if you want to start a fire
sure dinner in a show dinner in the show
yeah
i hope it's a radio show for most of
your guests that's
um and yeah they are hungry so that is
that is fine are you gonna like make
a little camp
and have a fire and all that yeah i
i don't want to attract attention oh we
already have a truck up here in the
bluff
yeah so i i think the fire will be fine
we need it
well and and if we stay up on the bluff
we'll be pretty visible if we go down
between the pyramids
we won't be as visible but boy will we
be in the middle of things
so i think up here with a fire we'll set
up a cop up here
okay so you you're
going around setting a camp and uh
everybody make me a um
everybody make me a luck roll
oh yes oh
32. all right everybody that missed it
make me a spot hidden roll
boy
all right alexandra i don't like your
voice
so you guys have been setting up your
camp it's been a little while emma is
uh keeping the the people nice and calm
and
as is ladling out soup and you know
things are pretty well set up
and you are taking a minute to like look
at the pyramids
that you see uh
a line of
eight figures
do they look like the people who were in
the warehouse
they do and they are walking
towards the bluff i'm gonna like
back up a few steps and just like slap
out and and
whack down whack donald on the shoulder
but look
those aren't missing paper i think so
they are they are they're walking
very cautiously like shambling
i'm gonna get my rifle with my scope on
it would this remind me of what
did i see would this remind me of what
we saw in the basement in new york
with the chamberlain okay no this seems
more like
blind people being told walk in that
direction
okay and not knowing what's in that
direction yeah with your scope you'll
see
like there's these people have been
chained together
at the legs um
[Music]
they still have no eyes
and one of them the front one has like a
shepherd's crook and he's like using
that to like
feel his way and they i mean it really
looks to you like someone said
just walk that direction don't see
anyone guiding them they seem to be uh
not zombies or whatnot it may just be
our
our people that we're missing yes and
how often has it been that easy
emma who's sending them out i'm coming
what yeah what what's happening
on this point the rest of our people
that's a trap yeah so obviously a trap
it actually hurts
they're coming they're coming to us
i mean if they turn into spiders shoot
them
we capture them yeah we could
we could what do we have to capture them
um
they're all chained together so ooh so
accurate
yeah we just capture one tie it to the
truck then they all can't go anywhere
that's amazing
that's pretty good and then they'll be
in the middle of the camp when they turn
into spiders
well what's terrible though is that
they've been tainted by the black
pharaoh so they're no longer good and
pure
how do we untaint them they've
if he shows he can do something a holy
sacrament
does he have the supplies for that
i don't know i didn't ask him while i
was hitting the ceiling on fire we we
have
wine yes we could use that
we have wine as part of our body of
christ
crackers crackers should do well we have
wine we have bread
it's about unleavened bread is what it
has to be
crackers that's okay i'm gonna let it go
i've let a lot of stuff go that's not
the one that i'm gonna that's not the
sticking point here
i i was genuinely i was genuinely about
to be very surprised that that the
the sacrament i wanted uh
i wanted a 20-minute discourse on
transubstantiation
this is this is what i'm coming for here
for
i mean if if if the belief is that it
turns into the body
jesus ate bread right i remember that
okay next the food that's right i'm
trying to i'm trying so hard to wind her
up
so can can we just five can just
let's circle back to the fact that we
have
zombie spider people heading towards us
i'm gonna glance over and see how much
closer they are to us at this point why
are they coming here
they're not making a lot of progress
once they hit
the once they hit the the the the
incline
now they're like very cautiously like
slowly climbing up do we just go get
them
we've got time we can give them an hour
to come to us it's fine do we want to go
fetch our trap
not really i'd like to take a nap before
yes you're not wrong it's a trap now
kind of i mean i'd like to get a little
sleep before i you know i mean because
again
who's going to watch them because
they're up to no good i know
well and i don't think that whatever it
is is entirely their fault but you're
right they've been tainted by the black
pharaoh and
the thing that yeah anyway
i mean i'm thinking all the things right
now in my head i'm thinking
they turn into like the thing with the
teeth and then or they turn into a
parrot shark or they turn you know they
mean i'm going through or they turn into
a spider or they turn it you know
you're going back to the beginning of
our adventures here great but wait okay
what if we get them
and we like stake them a little farther
away from us
and we could just beat them and stuff
but we could just stick them over there
like an experiment we need to get them a
tent at least and some fire or something
to keep them warm
how would and how would you like to
explain chaining people to
posts to the rest of them they'll hear
them if nothing else
that doesn't change my question
they're not going to be able to see them
they won't be able to see them no
hear them put them in a separate
location
human people and maybe the priests
will fix them up later if we ever find
that fella
yeah are they human
people who knows but i don't know emma
is there anything
you can do anything you learn from the
church to find these things out
i'm sorry when did i become the zombie
resurrectionist
do you have you don't have any holy
water do you have you blessed some water
wait a minute no i don't i emptied that
so i could put some liquor in there
because we're in egypt
knocking approximately no one i mean
that's the don julio gig
if he makes it i just yeah
i just enjoyed the fact that emma said
when did i become the zombie person and
don was like well you were at the
vatican for a week
zombie jesus all right here's here's
yeah here's it here's what i'm going to
suggest then um
i'm i think that we should uh
get them up here god help us
where do w where else are they going to
go they're coming straight at us
let's put them in a tent let's put them
up and feed them or whatever let them
let them bury watch them keep an eye on
them
but we also go they've already got a
chain so i say we chain them to the tent
then
but then we go and check the pyramid no
not go inside you didn't know my
sentence
check it for what whatever sent them out
was inside that pyramid they came out
the door
the black pharaoh sent them out the
black pharaoh possessed
oh oh we just lost somebody
are we in the right spots nope yep no
everybody got shifted one
joan is in charge joan take it away
all right i'm the keeper now wait hold
on i'm ready okay i'm dr hollister so
i'm not into this
cameo here who am i you're still
alexandra
like you and i are boring we're still
ourselves
[Laughter]
oh sanity is restored it's all bad
there's no answer like what do we do tie
him to the truck and put it
all right we just keep him on the guard
give him another watch and wait for the
trap didn't strong but we're gonna have
to have a watch tonight anyway
so exactly so you guys are cutting into
my nap time
let's let's let's finish eating
i really want to go check the pyramid
but i will
wow about a wisdom on this one
thank you all right so about an
hour later grumpy noises
um you hear the clanking of chains
oh here they come and
you hear a you hear a a a sad
voice saying please
like like the like the customer service
emma comes out and she's like hi
how are you can i get you something to
eat and drink come this way
and like usher them for eternal
salvation
press one pretty much uh
all right they they are like they
start
crying okay and i try not to like
touch them but comfort them be like um
and the the four other people are like
is why um
mrs singh is that you is that they're
like recognizing people and so the two
groups are intermingling
oh oh no no no no no you know what
and i try and separate the two and just
be like you know what they've walked in
the desert
the whole day they didn't get the ride
let's let's
let's let them eat why don't the rest of
us go to bed like try and just separate
the groups
i don't i don't want that over here that
they can use it's tent right here it's
an empty tent perfect for them to
take naps and or whatever um
but but that and a a gentleman
in the eight says but but that's my wife
sir you need medical attention you've
been out in the desert all day
why can't i see that's why i need
medical attention
exactly why can't any of us
see evil evil has worked in mysterious
ways
um one of the four people goes you you
keep saying
that what do you think made
what do you think is making us blind are
uh i'm gonna use an
inspiration oh because it's gonna hurt
i'm gonna use the substitute d4 as the
inspiration oh it's gonna hurt just like
a d4 in the bottom of the foot
ought four i should use inspiration more
often man
um
that how did we get out here who drove
this truck
the the the doctor doc you're dr lam
right
dr lam was not blind dr lam was not with
us in the room
when this happened when the great evil
came upon us
in the warehouse so
only one of us can see
i can see yes that's how i got the truck
out here that time we're all going to
get
to where we need to go well and who else
the two of you were in the warehouse as
well
yes you told us that we needed to come
out here
what and that we would this would be
a a righteous
journey
why are we here what do we need to do
how can we help you if we are blind and
sacrifice my friends and this is just
the first one there is more to come
and then i get up like on a box just
because it's going to make me feel
better even though nobody can see me
a soap box perhaps alexander andre
making popcorn yeah you're just like
um that this is the first trial and the
first tribulation that we will face
against this great evil this is an
ancient evil this evil has lived
time and time again in eons beyond what
we know
this evil must be stopped it has been
stopped in the past and it must be
stopped today
and if we do not stop it today there is
no tomorrow
and so we must push through this
blindness and then i reference
my like the freedom speech from
tell him about job yeah
mention job and if we do not face
this evil
let's get him singing yeah and then
yeah exactly and that's a great idea
joan that is a great idea nothing but a
hymn
bolsters bolsters confidence bolsters uh
this sense of belonging and so i'm
going to start
yeah exactly uniform yeah
sweet and then just we all oh yeah
hallelujah when you start singing
like you notice like alex
like how does that mean alexander there
is music going on around you
it's it's it's in a key and and a tune
that she'd be able to follow still with
with her new voice so after
a moment [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and i mean this is an old
song this is one that she
grew up on too and so she she hums it
for a moment
and fine finding where the key is and
her new voice and then start singing as
well
all right yeah pretty soon everybody's
and it's very comforting because it's
very much like
this is something that i sang with my
mother when i was a child um
yeah the people will all start singing
along they they are
they are clearly inspired they still
want to like mingle together
the the four and the eight um
fun i give in well and i think i think
we're going to have to let them if only
because it's easier to keep watched that
way
otherwise we're splitting the watches um
and so the song ends and everyone's
really happy
and the guy who whose wife is one of
the four
says why are we still in chains
let me work on that let's see if we have
something in the truck to un
so i'm sorry i can't find anything in
said that you would be able to help us
sort of nice in a mean sort of way
or mean in a nice sort of way i'm not
sure which i'm not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] again
whoa whoa whoa i mean did he have a
spanish accent
no no no okay did he sound
extraordinarily arrogant
um and and the four of us just all look
at each other
he he told us
that you would be able to help us
and then he gave us a choice
he said we could stay with him
or we could come back to our loved ones
i i grabbed the man's hands and i tell
him i i
hate to break it to you but you've had
that was satan yes he goes by many names
he he disguises himself and tells us
that he is the black pharaoh
[Music]
yeah yep exactly all those cursed names
you're like using all these names that
like egyptian christians have never
heard
of yeah exactly um
i that's the issue with him
he is arrogant he feels that he will win
this battle
and he feels that and again i'm using
the word feels
instead of knows that by his side you
will be safe but what will happen is by
his side you will be his slave
and we will not be free and we will not
circling it back to the church yeah you
do
um but you can't get the chains off of
us
but well let me ask my take a look at
him
if only he had a crowbar yeah i was
going to say
can i take a look at him emma no don't
use the emma do you want me to
do look at him because they're blind so
maybe your facial expressions you tell
me
like give me yes or no here um
so let me do let me actually do a little
holy water spirit thing and just be like
blessing my child blessing my child and
see what happens i got a lock pit
kit i'll use my lock picks and emma's
worried you were pulling out the gun
should i you yeah you put some holy
water on them and nothing seems to
okay all right so i'll i'll lock pick
the locks often
all right yeah you it's it it's no
problem to
unlock these chains and they they
they thank you and they go and they uh
they they sort of all gather together
and
um you know you you can send them to
their little tent
uh you know they they see it seems like
the singing and
and at least some of emma's raving has
had positive effects on um
their or negative effects on their
sanity i guess because they're sticking
around
you know that's they made the right
choice
did they though i mean did we make the
right choice because again they're just
going to kill us in our sleep
look at my shoulder what else do we have
emma
what else i don't know we need to take
we
will need to take watches and split them
up two hours
two hours a person that's the easiest
way that we're going to get through this
i hate to say this but let's do two
people per watch because one person
alone is
i know it's hard not a lot of sleep i
know
we'll sleep during the sun but i mean we
can only watch so much sand by ourselves
in the middle of the night out here
if someone falls asleep it's over do we
have the doctor's cocaine
no sadly the bag of stimulants is with
the doctor
i think he took his stuff with him so if
he got eaten by one of those tunneling
things
well that'll be a very well stimulated
tunneling thing yep
tunnels
no i just i just gotta dig one more
that's all
i i i agree that two keeping watch will
be easier to stay awake but i think that
doing for only getting four hours of
sleep will be hugely detrimental for us
in the morning
what else are we doing in the morning
frankly nothing we'll be laying here
it's after midnight right now it is not
oh i thought you said
okay midnight is when they're gonna
get here
yeah nothing is gonna happen but we
could continue to watch
because and again my math is not the
best math ever
but don't we start the ritual tomorrow
afternoon
yes tomorrow when the moon at moon rise
yeah
all right assuming the area is clear so
we have another 12 hours to
continually watch and rest we can we can
take
during the daytime we can nap during the
day time yeah yeah that sounds good
well also keep in mind there's nowhere
cool really to rest except
in the pyramids we ran into that the
last time we were here well inside the
truck should work for a few hours
until the sun gets too old until it's
done so it starts it's about noon
right so this for the morning hours we
can use the truck
well then does anyone do we want to
do some first aid on people before we
start getting some rest
people got hurt earlier yeah
i'm fine just give him a look
you guys have your own tent over there
right fine i'll kick your ass later
how about you two i'm fine
if you could look at where was i shot
again in my shoulder
yeah my arm just yeah i was like just
trust my brain my
whatever because i'm down one hit point
technically so okay i'll come over and
do first aid on her
sure yeah i'm not that kind of doctor
i'm not a doctor full stop yeah
both of our doctors are like all right
yeah you'll get your point back that's
no problem
you get it back from rest well you're
probably not getting much rest so
um so it is going to be
now the night of june 4th so
it's actually two days until the ritual
right because it's the night of june the
ritual is the sixth
yeah this the fifth is when clive was
and we're hoping that that don julio
will arrive and be able to do
um so yeah it's you know it's getting on
towards midnight and um
there are now a there's
you know there seems to be people down
by the you see
torches down by the um
down by the pyramids i don't know
my rifle scope i'll see what do we have
as far as numbers what are they carrying
um it looks like a bunch of cultists
uh they don't seem to be carrying
weapons
um and they they seem to be
um carrying stuff up the pyramid
like on the side of the pyramid yeah
they're climbing up to the top of the
pyramid
how many of them are there climbing
right now there's about
six well we could we could take those
six if it's only them
but they're our problem of course is
capstone goes on the top the caps the
pyramid
maybe that's they're doing they're doing
something about the top
i'm trying and trying to keep us from
being able to put it there perhaps
maybe do we go deal with them
well they're sitting ducks on the side
of that pyramid maybe i can
start working on it and if as they
sure but just keep let's wait
there's only six if there's more i don't
want to start shooting so no there
there are six guys climbing up but there
are a bunch of guys down around the
pyramid
what was the numbers total what are we
you'd say down on the ground they seem
to be coming out of the pyramid
um out of both pyramids i should say and
you see at least
a dozen guys what i wouldn't give right
now for some written for some dynamite
right did we have some from
italy though that we had some i remember
you know what doesn't ship well
intercontinentally
probably we we we had a lot of a lot of
very interesting stuff but we had to
leave it in italy
we fashioned some other bomb perhaps but
i don't know if we have the supplies for
it
there is fuel diesel fuel in the back of
this truck i can use
does that that burns does that explode
yeah it doesn't really it's more of a
long
fire but with some combustible
materials i don't know
maybe some form of i mean i guess
i suppose it depends on how formidable
we think they are if they're
i mean there are ways would you be able
to hit them from here with your rifle
that's a hard not an easy shot here
i could i might be able to but not the
wind conditions how windy is it by the
way
uh it's not that windy you you actually
feel like you know the problem is
you can shoot one and then two
and three and you know if they
um you're not even sure they don't they
that they don't already know where you
are and they're just kind of ignoring
you
given that these people were told to
walk towards you
yeah and they're coming out of both
pyramids which means there's something
in that pyramid either they're staying
in the pyramid or there's a portal
in each of the pyramids they might be
doing some ritual up there
oh god what was that what was the story
that fellow told remember this
the where he told about
seeing this ritual performed in front of
the pyramid the one that they used
to bring him back van hooven
is around the story about and actually
so did brass jack brady
also told you know they saw some awful
things
happen uh
then there's some beast the top of the
pyramid and all these creatures coming
from the ground and the cultists are
killing themselves and being devoured
and
i also thought that horrible nonsense
do i hear that yep okay
um i think it was sacrifice is what i
turn and say because i'm trying to
remember my dream
of blood running down oh boy
oh boy you told me that even if i shoot
them i don't know if it would change
i think it's they were like ants there
were so many of them
that only fire and brimstone could wipe
out
all we're bringing it back
way way back now yeah like way back
not i'm trying to remember all of this
this is before i took it i know me too i
and i'm trying to flashback because i
was on a train and then i just go into
like this weird random like
let me tell you about the time that i
had this dream about me being on a train
and i saw nothing but sand
endless sand i mean if there was a train
here that would be fantastic
before i met you this that you had this
stream yes
this is when i used to read books and
put masks on don't do that
i mean i mean my instinct is that if we
if we start killing them now
it won't be the proper sacrifice and
that might help
but how many can we kill how many
bullets do you have
how how much can i stab before my arms
give out well this is not the problem
it's time i don't know if i can shoot
enough before they make it to our
position
it's just two of us i could help
but i just just shooting people
but they're occultists cultists
shooting people to turn themselves over
to the black pharaoh and will be used to
bring him
are we certain you think that you have
learned
in all of your studies and all your
crazy readings and what's not there
anything that you can
because i made some things to keep us
safe
i haven't really made a lot of things
i can call maybe bind a dole
so what is that
it's it's like a big sand worm
you can make big holes oh okay i think i
know what you mean
eat people in the sand right and just
devour them from the side that
made that earthquake that thing was huge
and that's that's one of the things the
ways that you can
get places without having to be on
top of the
earth
but alex we saw one of those worms that
ate um
clive joan would
if i could concentrate i
should be able to but i don't know if i
can make him eat anything
can lead a worm to cultist i was like
hang on a second which pyramid are the
cultists going up
uh the red pyramid the one that you want
to yeah i'm afraid if we start shooting
them in it and blood comes down that's
good enough
that's our that's on our hands yeah but
if the worm eats them
they'll devour them entirely they'll be
in the belly of it there'll be no blood
it's worth a shot well but it might
destroy part of the pyramid too and we
need that to stay in place so that we
can put the capstone on it
yeah i don't think we can fix a whole
pyramid like we could fix the capstone
yeah i couldn't fix the sphinx when that
went
oh the sphinx is destroyed by the way
sorry yeah but the pyramid can't grow
legs come alive walk around and like
kill an army so
there's that not with that attitude
[Laughter]
joan i can shoot some of the ones on the
on the pyramid if you can
take care of all the ones down in the
valley at least scatter them
no we shouldn't shoot anybody because in
my dream all the blood was running down
the pyramid
it was just a river of blood just
constant blood
thousands and thousands of cultists and
bloodshed
well there's not a thousand out there
there's maybe about 14.
what if what if we shot the ones who are
on the ground they wouldn't be on the
pyramid to bleed on
it that works there
and then the if i get a dhole it can i
don't want it to get near the pyramid
though
it would be able to eat the ones on the
ground but if it tries to go under the
pyramid
we may have trouble
i don't i don't i think what other
options do we have here
no we're running you're right we're
running out of time we're running out of
time 
let's just do what you can do but don't
what do you think's been happening this
whole time
you have we have six months until until
the eclipse
we need to we need to keep ourselves
together as much as possible and
by then we will have either save
the world or die trying
there seem to be it's this
there's a lot of activity down there
people are going out they're coming in
all right all right all right all right
all right can somebody get me a cult
let's get a cultist robe let's get one
two
three four coldest robes what like this
ghosty level
those people who came up they were
wearing robes yeah
sure see if we can get the robes from
them tell them that they're not
unclean what are you saying emma
and be when they do this ritual we'll be
in the middle of it
okay all right ezra i don't have it
written down
everything i need for the the binding
the dhole ritual do i have that in a book
you're you're you need very little you
need a dole
so you know first it's summon dhole yeah
and then it is bind dhole and
most of it they're they're not like this
one isn't a ritual the summon is a
little bit of a ritual
but it's just you know you can make a
circle in
uh in the sand you'll need a little bit
of salt
which you can easily get from your
supplies but the bind part
is not a is not a ritual
i need a little my blood too for that
right
blood magic is always the way yeah
i mean let's just evaluate our options
here are some problems
um we're basing this on the fact that
clive is dead and don julio is our only
hope
you've met the man good point
we have we have no room to throw stones
in that regard
we don't but also i don't know for
certain
that don julio is here to do the ritual
we did not have words again he lit me on
fire put put me on the ceiling of the
butt
like put me to the roof of the boat so
like we're not really on speaking terms
i didn't say hey bud what you doing here
he's like oh hey how are you you know
let's catch up have a cocktail blah blah
none of that it was
and then everything was on fire and then
the next thing you know he's gone
right i love i i truly adore the way
that you describe things
this is how it all plays in emma's head
it's really just
it's a very different version of the
world that happens in my brain
um so there's that i can only hope that
don julia will show up
and save us but if he doesn't then what
clive was going to do some horrible
summoning right to like
kill everything around the pyramid that
plan is obviously off the table
so the question then is is that what
joan is going to do
and and well and if it is
we can afford to wait a day right
because we don't start the ritual
until not tomorrow night but the night
after right yes but
darling they're about to do some
horrible ritual right now
and not only that didn't we did wasn't
it the fact that it had to be cleansed
before
our ritual which means that within this
next 24 hour period before
we have to cleanse it and then we can do
our ritual
yeah clive was gonna do his bit the
morning of the fifth
yeah right to give it like 20 to give it
a full
a long time between but even
even if we started whatever whatever
joan can
do at like the afternoon of the fifth
there'll still be a solid 24 hours
before we have to start the ritual
we can find out we can we can watch what
they're doing but they
they'll see us if they do something
horrible we may not be able to stop it
they may summon something before we can
summon something
so do we start shooting and summoning
whatever it is that junk and summon
well i'll shoot that's not a problem
i'll shoot regardless
i'm sure i'm certain of it all right
giant sand worm
now the summoning will take a little
bit
okay so all right so how much is a
little bit because if they start
shooting i'm not going to have a lot
i'll wait till after the summit yeah
it's i mean it's it's probably a half an
hour of chanting
okay all right assuming that if it takes
about that long to
chant and summon you're not going to
send it up on the pyramid right
no i can get up on on the pyramid
and start dealing with the people up
there you'll be trapped up there while
this thing this giant sand worm is
roaming around the sounds beneath you
i'll be well and not only that i'll be
trapped on this what about the
what about the rest of us what do you
mean
i can i can make the thing stay down
there it's not going to come up here
okay i don't know how the sandworm thing
works
and it's not going to come up on the
pyramid because john doesn't want it to
a certain
bonding works i bind it i sum it i bind
it and i tell it what to do
and that being the case it won't come up
on the pyramid you won't send it up on
the pyramid because we don't want to
deal with that i start dealing with
they put yourself in the helmet rescue
for what
that's the only way i mean the only
other way is light everything on fire
that cleanses everything i love this
idea but i don't think pyramids burn
i wish i wouldn't like the normal fire
but the people who are on them do
that's a fair point how do we get to
fire to them
carefully bicycles and grenades
ah we come back around to that done
always the answer
don't have it don't happen to get it
well and i i can move quietly through it
through the dark
i can i can get there without them
seeing me but
let me know the path you're taking i'll
keep an eye out for you if something
happens i've got you
got your back i'll come up the up at the
opposite side of the pyramid
understood so the timing on this is you
want to be
up the pyramid when joan is finished
with the summoning yes
and then when the summoning happens
you're going to start shooting donald
i might depends on the situation okay
um emma what is your role in this hole
sure not to fail plan
[Laughter]
then touch nothing touch nothing
all right um
all right professor lam make me a
oh 13. that's a great roll all right um
that's not quite an ultimate all right
so there is
a you you have
you have a weird moment where um
it's almost like satellite
thing where you you like are above
everything
and you see like throughout
throughout africa there are well
actually yeah
throughout you can see about a hundred
miles around you
there are two of these things that are
just like
burrowing through uh
through the earth and you reach out to
one of them
and you have bound it to your will
and you send it towards you and it is
zooming along
sixth i think that's a great role all
right so
um you and don julio are
continuing forward and
you hear a very familiar rumbly and you
like stop
and one of those things bursts through
the wall
like maybe 20 feet in front of you
and continues burrowing in um
sort of almost a perpendicular direction
away from you
uh i'm gonna make a uh
sand roll for don julio and he's
surprisingly fine with all this
uh you should also make a sand roll for
flashbacks
that could have been a fumble but it's
just a failure oh
a failure well we can inspire that
yeah out there take an inspiration for
that
oops i should have inspired don julios
to fail
uh yeah i make it now all right well
that is a that is very lucky you only
lose two sanity
versus the five the magic number
um and so and as it rumbles through
don julio turns to you
and he says we must follow that
abomination
i mean i think i think going straight
will take us to the pyramid where the
evil is
but if your heart set on it
oh it's not the pyramid it's around the
pyramid that we must cleanse the evil
from
i will defer to your judgment i'm here
to help you
why don't more people say that let's go
uh and and you guys head off um
all right so alexandra you are the
knight
you sneak up well actually make me a
stealth roll let's just
let's just ask let's just establish
that you are the knight
all right yeah you sneak up you know
at one point you you stab a poor
unsuspecting
guard you come up behind him you kill
him you have
climbed up the pyramid donal
you are
covering her the whole way
Joan the
the dhole gets there and what are you
telling it to do
i'm telling it to go basically
in front of the pyramid and
open like just open come up out
and open its mouth so i'm just gonna go
in front of the pyramid okay uh
whatever's there it's his it's theirs
don't leave yet elder brat
you got a few more minutes don't leave
yet run
all right so though oh a sand tiana
uh and donald are and
emma as a massive
horrible creature bursts
out of the sand and devours
3 or 4 cultists and then 
like a whale
kind of beaching just goes back
under the sand.
All of you should make sanity rolls.

Two things are gonna happen .
Emma, where can you go that is safe?
the pyramid and i can stab my nemesis
the dark pharaoh all in one fell swoop
it's the best idea
ever i will end this nightmare once and
for all vengeance is mine
independence will be had the prophecy
has been fulfilled.
Joan you are busy concentrating,
Donal you are busy like trying to
and just jams down the the pyramid.
Emma you are not the night
but you are insane and so as you are
climbing up the pyramid. you are three quarters up
when you see alexandra reach the top
where the capstone would be.
Alexandra you look down and you hear the black pharoah say "not the bride i was expecting but i'll take it"
