hello internet
friends and welcome to quests and
cthulhu
thank you so much for spending part of
your geek end with us we really
appreciate it
uh this is the third game of cthulhu i
have run in
two days i've run been running for
chaosium at gen con
uh it's been a lot of fun but uh
you know you you forget how lucky you
are to have great players when you play
with people you don't know
and amy just a few
quick announcements to get through as
always beer
is lovely i hear um
thomas our our good friends i almost
said
thomas is taking over i almost said
thomas biersch
someday someday gordon bierce we
really appreciate their sponsorship uh
it is lovely to see
uh we have birds of paradise of
course
the official dice of quests and chaos
uh they are they're good dice man
they roll well just get yourself some
birds of paradise
we have a code i think it's chaotic if
you
enter that on the website you get 15 off
your order
um i have been super impressed with the
shipping time of these dice they show up
very quickly to your order
so you can get you can order some and
have your dice for next week's game
probably so we have
another full week here at quests and
chaos of entertainment for you half full
i guess really
monday it's rick and morty it's the
finale
probably given how we do these it was a
one shot to start with and now it's
what is this number eight or something
um
so it is it is we are promised
it is the finale of rick and morty d and
d look forward to it
we have is is is that other project
going to start on mondays then the the
the new one
what what have we announced that other
project
probably not but it's just d and d i
spire peak
wow that was almost how i would have
uh the cool thing about that is the gm
because
james is returning to the gm seat
and i that's awesome i really enjoyed
uh i i really enjoyed the way he was
running it and
oh my god somebody in chat has an
everything is fine
like icon thing and i need that
where did that come from i need that
winter wine
nightingale yeah well how does white and
why are there vowels in that wine
tonight it should be ivory things fine
uh that is awesome i need that i don't
know how you get those little pictures
in the

so monday rick and morty one last time
and then starting on mondays
dragon something spire ice it's a whole
thing
james is running that's the important
part it looks like a fun cast
i think it's going to be a neat time uh
tuesday
we're back to thomas we're back to
thomas classic people found
thomas new thomas you know new thomas
got a big marketing push
people thought they were gonna love it
turns out they just wanted thomas
classic
so we're going back to thomas classic uh
uh
it is the old formula it's you know
it's like a it's like a
it's like a comfy shirt you know it it's
not too great it's not too bad
but you know it works it smells okay so
chaos agents back back for
uh tuesday and then we are back here
saturday
and sometime in august depending on
thomas's schedule one of the tuesdays in
august
i cordially invite you to the dark
vision song contest
it will be a fifth edition battle of the
bands
uh me running fifth edition dnd
it really is the end of the world it is
well how much
running and how much yeah yeah i'm i'm
running from
yes i'm designing it so that i have to
do as little as possible i'm gonna let
you all cause all the trouble
uh but that that is gonna be sometime in
tuesday
we'll we'll we'll figure that out
sometime in tuesday sometime in august
uh on a day that thomas has real life
that he has to do
uh and i guess i'll have to change my
name to thomas for that day
uh thomas i'll be tom no
it's just time won't be running d then
that's right technically yes uh
so we're gonna have
at the break now i have to check on this
and
and chat you can decide but at the break
we're gonna have a giveaway of some
libris arcana dice
and it's possible that amy is going to
use them during this game
which which either completely
destroys the resale value
or raises the resale value we're not
sure which but are you going to use them
this time
i'll try all right i'll try i mean
here's the thing
if i just teleport to you know to the
bahamas
probably not we can do that
i want to do that can we do that well
didn't
i mean technically we have that portal i
mean it's going to take use of power but
oh i i was like in real life i'm all
so we will be giving away at the break
those
uh libris arcana dice that will uh
that will have the the special magic
that only amy can bring to dice
all over them
sounded really bad yeah i believe well
it's better than the first time i said
it when i think i used the word smegma
back in the day that was actually wasn't
that that might have been the world
ending
i think the world ender dice were a
giveaway
wow i think the world indoor because it
was we were doing a thing where every
time you fumbled you had to pass the
dice
yeah yeah ended up with amy yeah that's
we have a habit of giving away the dice
that kill universes and player
characters yeah that's right
that's right so i think that's
everything we've got amy let's watch you
do math
okay so little math here in fact we're
okay so we're going to start backwards
we're going to go backwards we go upside
down
um brayden five ash 500 to the players
thank you very much let me find my
little bucket of things so we start with
four so this is now our fifth
what no
it's us first then him stop telling me
what to do
anyway and then also braden a segment on
the untitled podcast
it pretty much is like stop telling me
what to do actually that should be a
segment stop telling me what to do
that's another kickstarter it'll be yep
it'll be connected to uh
the week in kickstarter yep this weekend
kickstarter don't tell me how to spend
my money
that's everybody here at this table
don't ezra i'm looking at you
it's our money brayden five ash also
gave 500 bits to the tpk fund so i'm
assuming this goes to ezra
i mean you know there have been times
when it could go to emma
buddy friend pal i like you stop making
me dislike you
if it's if it's tpk then he only gets it
if he tpks
it's conditional this is yeah i was
about to say it has to be this is for
the world ending
scenario right here all right
and as per usual thank you squirrel on
the run
500 bits yeah that's why i can't back
another kickstarter because she keeps
giving you people bits
actually it sounds like a ploy she's
yeah squirrel is probably like i just
need less stuff in this house
so i'm just gonna start giving away bits
you are not wrong okay
all right so tamagotora 500 to ezra
because everything's fine the
everything's fine campaign
i need that thing yeah
yep and then a thousand to
um from tomato torah to thomas first
space chaos
nice knife
no hey we could end up in space
it's been done before on the show
let's pause for a moment and
congratulate thomas on
completing his one shot
he teased me i haven't finished the last
episode yet so i don't know who's died
and he told me that i have to finish and
watch so i i don't know i wanna
i want to find out like how many people
died i will i will say as
as a player the ending took me
completely by surprise and i'm still
thinking about it
almost a week later so really good game
i really enjoyed it if you all haven't
watched the three part
that the three part one shot you really
really should
check out those amazing casts i love the
chaos agents because they just go crazy
with their characters
they just did they kill each other
because when i ran cthulhu for them they
they like almost immediately started
trying to kill each other
there were moments i was worried they
might be if i just do that
there were moments when i was worried we
were going to turn on each other it's
why i was consciously like backing down
a little bit sometimes
please continue your math all right so
before we get to the best for last um
lonely yeti 312 a thousand for the
players thank you very much lonely eddie
all right and then are we ready ladies
and gentlemen saving the best for last
number one the baroness 1000 to ezra
please give us our gi joe moment
fairness wins as always
the gi joe moment this week is a little
different so there's a
uh there's a board game that came out
last year called unmatched
and it's a really cool idea it is a
modular board game
where two things fight against each
other and the reason it's modular
is that as they release more things
you could fight
a dinosaurs against buffy the vampire
slayer
and or jack the ripper
versus whatever and so they have a
contest right now where you can submit
what you think should be the next
unmatched and you best
believe i submitted unmatched gi joe
versus cobra
uh it is it's a it's a really fun
little game it's a
uh it's a a little board and then
sort of some moving combat and you play
cards to give your things powers
and you know some of them are like a
single really powerful thing some of
them are a lot of smaller power things
but it's a really neat idea the sort of
scaling
of the various adversaries so that you
can
bring out you know you could fight uh
velociraptors
versus you know red rot red rob
red riding hood or something like that
fairy tale characters
so i have submitted and now i have to
actually like
come up with stats and suggest
characters and stuff so i'm working on
that
and best believe the baroness will be in
there for sure
but that is look amy's doing math in
real time
that was outstanding i love that and
and and and i mean sir pintor has to be
in there too right
you know yeah the problem is i all my
favorites are the cobra guys not and so
the gi joes i'm like i don't care which
ones are in there except
it's gotta i i want to make them all
just the pet gi the gi joe pet
uh squad yes oh my god do it submit
there
uh but there that's a little gi joe
side moment okay so there's more bits
and apparently i lost one that was the
math base
um so stillbo gave 500 to alexandria
for saving us from a tpk so that goes in
our pile so now it's your responsibility
to not kill us
um and then jay matthews
yep and then the ending
yeah no it's the ending nailing the
ending oh and then
um wait a minute what do you mean a
thousand stop talking to me and chat
people i don't know what's happening
um and then 500 to ezra least he felt
felt left out okay no
i think with ezra's got five five uh
inspiration i think he's done
and then supposedly i missed one from
the baroness
i don't know where that i think she gave
some to thomas as well
oh i'll take it i'm taking it how much
how much chat did i miss five hundred a
thousand i feel a thousand is
appropriate
but baroness the bonus doesn't do
anything halfway
okay a thousand to us then i feel that's
appropriate i'll roll with that
yep as i will roll with it thank you so
much
for the bits we really appreciate
them
it is ridiculous what you do every
week
in this chat channel and frankly you
should all be ashamed of yourselves
if you eat less bits you could get more
kickstarters
that's all i'm saying or
you know you could you could keep the
the meager lights that are
uh currently on me on in the fancy
lights in the studio i missed the jungle
or the forest that's right you were the
first one away yeah
unfortunately alas you guys really
cleaned up the studio wow yeah thomas
went with the weed whacker and just you
know
finally cleaned it up and and then
took the weed whacker to his own hair
that was the it looks better now
you know a couple weeks afterwards it's
growing in
i mean at least he has the advantage on
me that it's going to grow back
mine's not you know there are parts that
are just not coming back anymore
he has the advantage of being six foot
four that nobody knows
it's like he could literally be bald
right here
but nobody knows because nobody can see
that high he he
he crouches really weird behind like the
panels so i can
like he's usually this tall on me when
i'm coming over to the to
the panel to look at something so you
know
he folds up funny he folds up
funny that might be uh
[Music]
it sounds vaguely cthulhui uh
so last session i actually enjoyed um
last session nick described as we were
uh getting ready here nick just said
last section was all just damage control
uh and
uh in the course of damage control you
caused a great deal of damage
uh you so you returned to shanghai
and you got the the bloated woman
disappeared
and you you ended up finding
some of madame lin's people who were
uh who were watching that and
you fl chased one of them and uh
let him go and then your
your translator ratted you out because
you treated him pretty awfully
uh and he he ratted you out to
adam lynn and you were attacked by
madame lynn's forces
uh where we found out that really madam
lin just still hasn't gotten over
emma and tried to hurl her into the
ocean but emma discovered that she is an
olympic level diver
and splashed right into the ocean
uh amazingly and you managed to
deal with a couple snipers that were
holding you down
and made your way out and you found from
the translation
you know the the the correct capstone
for each of the rituals in each of the
areas
and you also know the ritual itself and
what you need to do
so you've got the formation of a plan i
believe
according to the calendar tomorrow is
the full moon
i think it's actually today because we
are
we are early morning may 7th early
morning of the seven
all right so the full moon is tonight um
it is it is like three or four in the
morning
we ended last session with a long
philosophical discussion
about if they should kill people and
where they can find innocent people and
how they should go about doing the stuff
they did
and well we did send we the back up is
we did ping rogers and tell him to have
his version of innocent blood people
ready yep yeah oh and he's still not
sure where he's gonna find innocent
people either um
so yeah it is it's like two or three in
the morning
on the seventh
um you've been you've been booted out of
yet another warehouse
and you're i believe you were actually
just going to end up going to a hotel
was your
no no no we we were going to
we broke into another another uh
warehouse and have been using that and
dr hollister
administered a ton of morphine to
uh donald to get him to
lay down and actually get worked on
that's right
it was necessary for him to stop moving
alexandria wasn't arguing with you even
though i'm reasonably sure she saw that
happen
yes there was a minor player
assault
with morphine and you know it was
probably all for the good as donald was
about to go out by himself
not completely and
take care of business so yeah there that
is where we are it's
it's 2 30 in the morning
it's been a hell of a day i think
we were actually are we are we
considering just
calling it quits on
shanghai for now and given how little
time we have
going directly to egypt
i mean the the the point could be made
that
we have seven more full moons so it
isn't
dire that we catch this one
but i would win seven we should have
seven because this is may may
no is it well seven after this one so
it'll be june july august september
november
there might be two in one of those
october yeah there might be two
that's true oh no actually the eighth is
a full moon the
22nd is the absence of the moon and the
30th is the half
so the full actually happens on june 6.
yeah there's probably a month where
there's two so we have seven or eight
after this one because we're still
we're not halfway through the year yet i
don't want to wait another
month to do something it's october
ooh the 31st of october
the 31st of october is a full moon and
it's the second
moon in october so i'm sure there's a
real
i'm sure there's a technical thing for
it but yeah
and just to let everybody know 1925
actually does mirror 2020 so in reality
there should be two full moons in this
october coming up
there you go a blue moon in october very
exciting that i'll be in bed before the
moon comes up but that's fine
i wonder i wonder if there's gonna does
that mean there's gonna be another
eclipse in
in 2021 in january i think so but i
think it's in the southern hemisphere
right
i think because i know somebody who's
like talking about traveling for it
right that seems wise
he says yeah uh
you guys are talking about possibly uh
uh
ditching shanghai i hear talk of a
letter that i've not heard about
i'm very excited about so i that that
does lead
kind of to to the next question that we
wanted to address
do we go into madame linz
i mean it's risky it's real risky yeah
there's only one person who i would
actually
suggest do that job and i would suggest
they do it alone
and i look over at donald he's currently
look i i agree that he is the quieter
of of all of us however i don't want him
going into madame lin's
alone that is a recipe for disaster
partially because what if he gets caught
partially because what if the thing on
the back of his neck decides and decides
to screw us over
and what's his medical situation right
now
highly medicated
i mean out of character it would be
what's his hit points but like he's been
bad
he's he's fine now a couple hit points
lost at this point everything's fine
i did i did real good first aid on on
scene and then and then the doctor came
in with medicine
yeah i don't know it's like yeah it
sounds like it's going to be a hard
thing to go
into to madeline's and do anything can
we do that after we do the ritual
i mean yeah if we come back later we'll
have the element of surprise
so i i suppose that well maybe but that
does i suppose you never do
depend on on whether or not we want to
we might be able to open a door directly
to that room later
walk right in walk right out
i am hesitant to overuse the doors if we
don't have to
because i mean i i know that you don't
know him very well probably but
joseph is a friend of ours and
true doctor i don't i don't know dr
so i am hesitant to do any i we don't
know what the long-term effects
of that are is doing to his brain so the
the more that we can minimize its use
the better i think
well if we go to
madame lynn's when we would have to wait
until tonight
correct and if we do then we miss the
full moon and then
we go right now we have to go right now
and and then i look over at donal who's
out cold
yeah then then that would be alexandria
going in by herself
which i'm also not a fan of but i'm i
don't know how
sneaky you guys can be or no offense
how how you are in a fight if it came
down to it
terrible
yeah i mean have some but you know
not the level that you're at
well i've been i i very much hope that
people aren't at the level that i'm at
because i've been doing this since i was
a child
so
yeah if we if we were to go into madame
linz
i would very much advise that we take
more time to assess the situation see if
she has any sort of movement pattern
go in when she's not there not worrying
about if it's day or night just if she's
not there that would be the time to go
in and get out
well she's generally there during the
day and goes out to her clubs at night
or at least that was her
pre gorilla pattern
again i'd love some more time to collect
some
intel on how she actually goes about
things now
that said though i don't want i i don't
want to stay in shanghai and do that
recon
and we don't know anyone that we trust
here now
i mean we got attacked last night yeah
yeah
and if we stay here much longer she'll
find us again and do it again
agreed so i think we got to get out of
here
i agree wow whether or not we make a pit
stop
at madame lin's right now or not
i think i think it depends it really
does
is it possible for the door to go blip
blip
like go blip to there and then blip two
you know it has to be just one you'll go
to that
you've not seen that possibility it
seems like every time you see it the
door opens
and then and then you know once you
close it it's done yeah
so yeah so i i guess it comes down to
do we think that it will be safe to ju
to come back to shanghai to retrieve it
yeah because what happens the
translators already
set us up once i mean i hate to say this
but the translator set us up
he could blab to madame lynn
about everything oh that's a good point
i didn't even think about that i that
just hit me
shoot loose lips make
jade statues oh wait yeah
i tried to beat you can just hate have
another jade statue made do we know what
it looks like
yes i've i've seen it several i've seen
it multiple times and i think i'm gonna
have to
well yeah so we have that that's the cap
the capstone but that's not the jade
statue and the eye has to be
this yeah we're talking about it because
it's the same thing
but it's different but so if i hand you
some paper that you draw
oh the the statue or whatever is
different those
symbols are always the same yeah but
i'm still just trying to get a beat on
like
are we confident that we know what it
looks like like if you can sketch it
with some degree of accuracy
let's just make a new one you can
smash it into a thousand pieces who
cares
we'll make a new one i'll i'll glance
around and see and see if i can find you
know paper and pencil and then uh
getting a piece of jade that big and
getting it carved
it's pretty expensive we could have
rogers do it we could have rogers do it
you asked him oh he'd kick us well he
did
he did say he wanted to mass produce
these things and it says
in the ritual what is necessary so
although the ritual in this instance the
ritual seems to be pretty geographically
specific
mass producing might recall might
require
what what's what's the problem with with
making a jade statue getting a big piece
of jade getting a car
getting the things yeah a good size
piece of jade we would have to carve it
correctly
and things exactly expensive and
time-consuming
and we're working off of our memories
actually that's a good question is there
a drawing or anything like that in the
scrolls
yeah there are no illustrations we'll be
working
off of our memories and i think i can
sketch it with reasonable accuracy
but i hand you a notepad and
let's call it an intelligence role oh
good
in the box that is 50 so that is a
success
you you draw something that looks very
like a bloated woman
and you superimpose those hieroglyphics
that you can copy off of that into the
middle
yeah so i'll i'll i'll be like sitting
on on on the where
on the warehouse floor just sketching
and then like
hold it up and be like emma does this
look right
yep looks pretty good she barely even
looks
yep yeah whatever yeah fantastic
but again that's basing it on my
memories and emma's memories and what if
that's wrong
we can do more research on the bloated
woman if it's a matter of
capturing her likeness i i don't know
this this doesn't seem like that much of
a problem
but if we have something that's already
made
that's i'm sorry that's guarded by a
psychotic immortal gorilla uh
i think the government can put the bill
it's guarded by a heartbroken psychotic
gorilla that is probably tearing up
pieces of shanghai at the moment
[Music]
are you making a case for going or
against going yeah i'm confused now
i'm making a case for going because if
she's out tearing up shanghai she's not
at home
guarding the thing and then all her
other immortal gorillas are dead
and human guards we can deal with human
guards
but what do we do with the unconscious
donald right now
i mean let him rest he should rest
i just i would think that it might all
make the most sense that if we're we
need to be someplace close
so alexandria doesn't need to get very
far from madame linz in order for us to
just
leave yeah we're in a truck
okay that's true we we do have have the
big rental truck so we could
you know load donald up into the back of
that
and then you know you guys drive home
and you guys drive relatively close so i
can just get there
is anyone good at driving
yeah yeah yeah nope i live in new york i
have no reason to drive
oh i've got i've got i've got i've got
some some driving skills
i'm going to drive that's awesome
well you might be our getaway driver
we're going to want to get some distance
before we move there
here's a question why can't we just
drive the truck through the portal
into their office it's a size it's the
size of a door
not the size of a garage door remember
yeah i think roger should work on that
like just
just a little clicker just be like
youssef
the poor thing a little bit of
a single tear and a little bit of blood
drips oh
no we were making the comparison to
stranger things earlier yes
uh all right so it's it's almost morning
time
well then if it's if we've been spending
a while doing this
then we're gonna have to do it now and
then that and that is the question do we
do that or do we take the risk that
she's going to break the damn thing
because if if the translator ratted us
out
he'll probably i know i've given my
recommendation
i forgot what is it don't do it yeah
just get a new one
it'll be good enough but we'd have to
wait an entire
month one more entire month
because one more question one more
question
if what happens if somehow
stanford gets a hold of it then what
nothing who cares
yeah we make a new one okay nope but
yeah cause presumably he does not want
to seal yeah
yeah but he would want it to destroy it
thinking that that would be the only one
so if we are able to make another one
and he destroys the one at madame lin's
then
to us it's who cares moving on do you
think he knows that we have the scrolls
yes does madame lynn care about stanford
or i guess more importantly he doesn't
i mean i generally assume the worst in
oh so if it's if it's morning though how
is how's donald doing is he starting
to come
i'm not going to wake him up but donald
make me a constitutional role
let's see zero three
i'm good wow waking up on his own he
feels great
meanwhile all of us are like i hate you
stop it yeah i know yeah
he's like good morning good morning
it's gotta be the magic in his neck or
something that's not human
hey donal want to go housebreaking all
right let's do this
i love the doctor's expression i'm i'm
if you don't sustain any more
injuries for one week donald
i will buy you a bottle of booze
of your choosing price
is money is no object
i'll take your blood offer but i'm still
going
sounds good seems unlikely all right if
he's willing to go then we'll be back up
we'll drive over there
yep let's get in the truck yep all right
so
what is your plan for assault number
something on madame well actually this
might be your first assault on man
how about we use the roof of the truck
to get over the fence
do we want to drive a truck close there
it's it's not quite it's a moving truck
basically it's
yeah just just park it right next to the
uh the wall
yeah because that won't get any
attention yes slippery truck
i would think that we'd want to park it
a ways away well we will after they get
my my concern is much more getting back
out over the fence coming the other
direction
i'm no longer riding shotgun
and we have no way to communicate with
each other do we once they're over
it's a it's a meet-up point so yeah yeah
we have to figure out where we're gonna
park and wait
at a certain time i think i i think you
guys park
um four or five blocks away far enough
away that that it looks like you're
actually a delivery vehicle of some
variety
um but not but not so far away that it
looks weird that we're hauling this
massive stocky thing
let's let's try like maybe one or two
blocks away because i think gorillas can
move faster than people
yeah no no you're running wow
how high is it the wall of her place
is about
eight feet tall then i can easily lift
alexander up she can pull me up as well
that's my problem almost all of her
defenses were ornamental
uh because she used to have two immortal
gorillas that you know would keep anyone
remember the guard if i call correctly
we're we're we're gaining daylight
though so we need to get a move on we
need to go
conversation in the back as joan
drives
sure i'm used to people talking behind
my back
all right so the car the truck pulls up
uh
a couple blocks away and you guys make
your way
to madame linz
and you everything seems very
quiet it seems like you know this is not
a morning place
fair yeah so so we'll we'll come
alongside the wall
probably a far around the corner and
down the way a bit from
the guard station assuming there's no
like patrols or anything like that
none that you've seen no okay this
like this whole thing is just a monument
all right so we've got to rope with us
i'll take a couple of
uh pistols with me and then that's about
it rope and pistol should be positioned
yeah worse and and i have my daggers of
course
okay yeah so you you get over the
wall
no problem and again her house is a
little more modern there's
essentially the the you are in a bamboo
grove
uh where there used to be gorillas and
um the the whole this side of the house
is basically
uh mostly glass mostly windows
so you can see the house is dark
uh inside it doesn't look like
there's
anything moving around uh
and you know you could
probably climb the that room is on the
second floor of the house
so you could and there's a there's a
balcony there and then the glass
door would pull open so you could
probably just climb up there
all right i was i'll lift you up with a
rope
oh hang on one second i slip alexandria
a note
um put this put this where the statue is
before she goes in sorry i'm having
computer problems so it wasn't totally
in there for a second but yeah all right
and i'll i'll take it glance at it nod
and slip it in inside my
my my shirt all right so
uh both of you make me stealth rolls
well
all right 53 is a regular success okay
uh goodness that is a 10 which is
not a critical success but very close
you are the knight
yes so you make it up to the base of the
building uh
and with no problems no one has even
seen you excellent
all right lift alexander up into the
second floor balcony with the rope
yeah and i mean we've we've done this
before so it's really for me you know
hands foot lifted yeah
uh yeah you are there you are in
front of
uh that that large dining room um
now that you're up there next to the
window it looks like um
a tornado has hit this place or an angry
gorilla
one of the two is the statue still
intact
so none of the things that were in here
are in here right now
oh no all right i'll i'll tie off the
rope and draw and drop it down for
donald
and you are on the second floor you're
like i said donald now you see what uh
alexander saw
this this room has been ravaged
all right we'll collect that rope first
off let's
carefully check the doors is it open
locked what's the condition
uh it is the the sliding door is open so
you can just
slide it aside and go in i'll show you
all right and i'm gonna i'm gonna draw
one of my dragons just hold it loosely
down by my side as
i slide the door open and step inside
carefully looking and listening around
all right so one uh
um
so as you come in you are immediately
hit with the stench of
death something in here has died and it
smells
awful
i really hate that smell
starting to become accustomed to it
unfortunately yeah just because you're a
customer doesn't mean you don't want to
vomit
where do you think we should go where
would she put this thing
i'm going to stop it pause and think
about because we've seen most of the
house at this point right
um emma's seen most of the house mo
the rest of you have mostly seen
and and actually flint saw a fair
amount of the house
but you guys have mainly seen this
room
and then the hallway and the the the
sort of the the anti-chamber
and the dining room so both of you
so i i failed that by two yeah
though maybe we can inspire it or you
can alright
yeah okay did anybody make it or no oh i
i got a hard success
yeah so i just roll 31 that's also hard
success all right so okay both of you
simultaneously find out what that stinch
of death is
as pinned to the wall
is madame lynn madame lynn's
long-suffering uh
and there are knives like through his
shoulders that basically
uh his broken neck lols at a horrible
angle
as he is just pinned up to the wall as
another piece of art in this room and
uh all right so
i'm looking around or oh i'm gonna look
around first and see if there's any
pieces
of any of the stuff that was in here
laying about
no no it looks like everything you know
of of the value of the art was removed
and then this place was smashed
all right then let's look around quickly
all right so you come out in a hallway
um
the place seems totally silent you don't
hear
uh any noise again not a morning
place
uh and there are several doors all
through the hallway
you know that one of them will lead
will lead down to the first floor which
is where the anti-chamber is and all
that stuff
um and somewhere there is a
um there's a a stairway up because
so up or down what was on the third
floor
i don't think we've ever found out why
don't we find out
sure all right so yeah you find the
stairway
and you head up and the third floor
is essentially one big
penthouse it's madame lynn's bed
chamber
and it's it's very dark
and there's a curtain at the back of the
room
um i'm gonna pause and listen to see if
i
if i hear any like guerrilla sized
sobbing or snoring all right make a
listen roll
let's see 65. i've also success on
listen roll regular
regular success with a 67. okay um
i mean this seems like a possible spot
depending on how valuable she thinks
it is let's go let's take a look let's
move
all right so yeah i'm i'm i'm creeping
forward and it's it's
really dark right so i'm trying i'm
trying to
move slowly enough so that i can see
what's under my feet so i don't kick
anything or trip anything
let's see i'll make you an offer you
can either
um be careful or be
quiet so you can either give me a
dexterity roll
and you avoid everything on the floor or
you can be stealthy and nobody will hear
you
doing stuff i'll go for dex my dex is
much better than myself
all right she's being careful donald
what are you doing dexterity is also the
operative type right so you're both
being careful 54.
24 is the is a hard success no problem
you guys
manage it is a little bit of a minefield
like this room has also
it hasn't been trashed like the bottom
room but it's definitely been
uh stuff is thrown around and sort of
left everywhere
and so you you both managed to like work
your way through
uh all of the stuff on the floor uh
there are a couple times where you feel
like your footfalls are audible or
there's like a
as you step on a a floorboard
but yeah you you make your way across
the room and there's
so this curtain is a floor-to-ceiling
black burlap curtain almost like a
blackout curtain
huh i'm not very look i'm gonna like
look look for an edge and like very
carefully pull it aside a little bit
with a fingertip
okay yeah you you find the seam
uh it appears to be three curtains
there's a center one and then two side
ones
you find a seam and you slowly uh
slide it aside
and is donald scooby doing over my
head
yeah yeah alexander is tall enough he
can protect people
um yes so
uh it is very dark inside um
no i'd like and i'll just like breathe
because i can feel him like hovering
slightly above me just breathe out what
should we do
it's probably where she sleeps probably
i'll pull the curtain aside just a
little bit more so that any ambient
light can get in so we can see
you even though even a little bit all
right yeah you see a ridiculously large
four poster bed that takes up most of
the space
and there is a non-gorilla sized figure
what who was that
i don't know does it smell like death in
here
let's let's go yeah i'm gonna like take
a second to look and see if i can spot
because i mean it's a two foot statue
right
withdraw carefully closing the curtain
okay all right
downstairs let's keep we'll keep looking
not see that all right so there were a
couple of rooms on the second floor
right
so we should probably poke in those a
little bit
yeah let's get this all right you
open so yeah you're you're checking out
and you open
one of them and it's a closet it's a
tiny little room
and curled up almost in the fetal
position
on the floor of this is the beaten and
and when the door opens he like kind of
looks up and his eyes are almost
bruised shut and he's like looking up
trying to
like straining against the light and he
says something in chinese
let's just close the closet door yeah i
i i i i'm just like close the closet
door
step back and be like he shouldn't have
ratted us out
all right yeah you you shut the door
on him
uh did you do you say that nope sorry
look quietly close the closet door
nope all right you close the door
and continue on you do not find
any other people or any other
uh you do not find the statue
all right down to the bottom floor i
guess let's keep looking
all right i'm actually going to pause at
the top of the stairs and listen again
to see if i can hear anyone
rousing or reacting to anything
all right make me make me a listen
roll soon
there's lots of pausing and listening oh
that is an ought nine which is a
critical success
regular but she's got it you hear
nothing yeah i i like pause at
the top of the stairs hand on the
bannister just listening intently like
i mean it's actually starting to get
weird that this house is so empty and so
quiet
yeah so far so good
good i'll follow you all right and i'll
lead the way downstairs
you head down the stairs both of you
make me luck rolls
oh here we go gate
uh success sporting success okay
everything's fine
um you you make it down the stairs and
um who
so you both made the luck roll who who
who made it worse my luck is 47 and i
got 40.
so seven so i mined 64.
i got a 48. so so all right so alexander
i'm not going to want to make this but
46 that's a success
all right there was a tripwire on the
stairway that you both avoided
and you see it like after after we got
past it
yeah look at it and just
as adrenaline just dumps through my
wow
yeah can i tell what kind of a tripwire
it is is it something that would explode
or just something to send someone down
uh i mean you'd know what
it looks like it's a string that goes
somewhere else
so the tripwire extends somewhere else
we'll be trapped let's leave it alone
i'm i'm wondering what is booby trap too
that leads somewhere
so as you're coming down the stairs
there's a wall
it's there's like a hole drilled in the
wall and that string goes into that wall
so i'm gonna like follow the wall around
to to find a door
and like try listen at the door and
then like peek inside so like a keyhole
or something
all right make me a listen roll 70 made
it
all right you don't hear anything in
the room okay
and then i want to peek through the the
uh keyhole
because all right something was set up
in there and i don't want to open the
door until i know what's going on
uh so there is no keyhole this is an
internal door
damn it arm it could be it could be
nothing
well i mean we can open the door there's
i'm gonna like touch the the door
knob
and see if it's locked if there's any
like
any resistance something like shoved up
against it or anything does not seem so
okay i'm glance back at donal
all right i'll follow you and i'll very
carefully like
slowly turn it turn the door knob and
press it open just the tiniest bit
just enough that it clears the door
frame so i can peek through okay
inside is a
large like four or five feet in diameter
gong
and the string so the gong is like
pulled out like this and the string is
tied to the gong so that
if the string were trapped the gong
would like smash down
and make a lot of noise alarm
a hell of an alarm i'm gonna push the
door open just a little bit more so i
can get a better view of the room and
see if the statue's in here
no it appears the gong is the only thing
in here all right
was that item originally in the main
room i seem to recall something like
that yes the gong was originally
yeah because it was with the the
iching thing wasn't it i ching
thing i can words really scrolls and all
yeah
let's keep looking all right you
complete the first floor and you find a
stairway down
into a basement like a
probably a larder or something like that
but you don't find anything else
both of you make me luck rolls here we
go
21 which is a real good success
10 out of 4 out of 47. yeah everything's
fine
um so yeah you find that stairway down
and that's it
all right i'll take the stairs just
watch for other strip wires
yeah seriously so yeah
there are no trip wires on these stairs
um
so you come down there's no door to the
stairs and you start to hear something
now
okay it's clearly people
and it sounds it sounds a lot like
people in pain
seems to be a common theme in this house
okay i
i still have my dagger out and down by
my side and just
quietly press forward is there any light
down here
nope
um did we pass through a kitchen at any
point
i i i've i might have grabbed like a
book of matches or something
make me a luck roll cool
uh 29 yes oh yeah you have a small back
book of matches
okay so when we get down there and i
determined that i just cannot see
um i'm gonna pull the book of matches
out all right
i'll i'll take the matches i'll i'll be
behind you
we'll affect you so you
strike the first match and um
before you is a tableau this
downstairs seems to be almost a
uh a cavern this that is the it's hewn
from rock it is the size of the
entire house so this is just one big
room
and it's a cage of some sort and
there are it looks like there are
people
out of the lights range that are
moaning
and in serious pain
and they do not seem to acknowledge you
let's keep moving maybe let's take a
closer look at this but
as we keep moving there so you're going
to come up very quickly to
essentially a barred wall yeah they are
in a cage
and the cage is most of the entire room
can we go around it at all no that it is
the this cage
the cage is not it's not four cages it's
just a caged wall that is this whole
wall it's like a dungeon down here
[Laughter]
wonder how long that's been here
well let's take a match and move a
little closer to the bar and see
what we see inside yeah all right um
so the people are all way at the far end
like
and it's clear that when things come
down here they don't like it
they are staying and they are um
you can barely see them but they seem
they look like people though right
nothing strange about them yeah they're
this you don't get a cara siri vibe you
don't get any sort of
that's these seem like people that have
uh
well is there anywhere else we should be
looking any other
buildings on the grounds we should be
exploring uh
not unless there's something in the uh
in in the gorillas
little house oh she has a gorilla
i can't think of where else i'm gonna
like kick it get and kick at the floor a
little bit in frustration
she cleared out all of her other
valuables perhaps she's stashed them
away and whatever her new location is
not just this but everything else what
about these fools here
in the cage what do we do
no on the one hand i'd prefer to get the
mount on the other
half it'll raise an alarm
yes at a minimum they'll know that we're
here
but bad for these full bastards but
there's nothing we should do
as you turn to go a weak voice
says something in chinese to you
just sort of not solemnly again not
coming near you
english
food please
i can't i'm too weak i i haven't eaten
what day is it i believe it's
a week cut
who are you are your staff what are you
doing here
she told us to come down here and that
and then she locked the door
and hasn't come back since
i
[Music]
i don't know where is she
she is probably in shanghai she stays at
listen we let you out she'll know we
i i don't know who you are i'm just so
hungry
if you can tell us where she is we're
gonna die in here
to give us some information fella where
is she how do we find her
she's at one of her clubs probably
where are her belongings where did she
put all of her valuables
i'm i'm i'm gonna put a hand on donald's
shoulder and like look around i want to
see if i can spot any keys anywhere
uh you do not see any keys is there a
lock at least
uh yeah there's a lock in the gate
donald has the lock picks
yeah in his pocket but he's not using
him yet
listen where would she put her her
precious belongings there's something we
need
where would it be and she took
everything with her
where did where is it all where did she
take it she took it into town she said
she didn't need to hide in this building
anymore
which which clubs belong to her if you
can give us a list that would be all of
them
perhaps you should talk to the other
fellows in the cage maybe one of them
knows
are you not gonna help us if you help us
we're going to die down here then just
give me an answer
someone must know where she took her
belongings ask around
he starts this guy starts crying yeah my
my hand on donald's shoulder just
tightens my nails digging in a little
bit i'm like
donal we need this information we need
to help them
once we help them it's too late what's
the point of saving the world if we
if we can't help people they know where
there's too much things for her to move
she wouldn't move it she would have her
own people move these things
her people know where these things are
they might have just put the things into
a truck
then then that's a clue why do you want
her stuff
we just want to go home we need one item
tell us what her things are we'll let
you out it's simple
why would she i was i was a cook
in her kitchen why would she tell me
where anything is
someone in that cage must know
he he will turn and he will say
in like halting chinese he is lying
on the ground like
the now that you can sort of you're
on your third match now
and you sort of gotten used to the low
light um
there are all the way at the end of this
room
like super emaciated like
can't get up like you know you can see
their joints
starving people and
some of them are kind of sitting leaning
against the wall
some of them just are lying there there
are clearly dead
and he'll you know he says in
he says something in chinese and a few
people will
answer back in uh
tamagotoro gives the the team 500 bits
to do the gds thing for the innocent
people so i'm guessing he means blow
them up
it sounds like i don't know but also
still
gave 500 to ezra for dead body art and
um we're we're cooks and servants we
don't
business have you asked
someone had to move those items a lot of
items out of this house
she didn't do it herself she would never
do it herself none of the guards are
down
donald none of the guards are down here
they would be
they would be the ones moving the
valuable stuff let them out or i'm going
to
fine fine out
all right so you you unlock
uh you unlock the thing and
um are you uh
they will they start trying to help each
other out
um many of them can't walk so the ones
that
can are like trying to support them um
they are all wearing cooks or servants
uh outfits and um
again this is like the walking dead
going past you this is one of the most
awful things you've seen and you've seen
some pretty awful things
yes these people uh
were probably hours away from dying
yeah i'm i'm dead i'm going to
uh she that she's my dagger and and go
in and help like
get people up moving very carefully
because i know how fragile bodies can be
at this stage
the stairs that'll be the hardest part
for them when you go into the cage
you clearly see close to there
is it in english or chinese it's
folded over you can't see it i'll crouch
down and pick
it up all right yeah it's in english um
and it says i knew you couldn't
why won't emma love me
and that's like that last one is all in
capital letters and like each one
why period won't period
just why and i'm gonna
just shake my head and murmur because
you can do things like this
and slip it into my pocket all right and
and then go over and start like helping
okay yeah so you you start
head you're getting people out um
at a certain point you have
you're starting to get the last few out
it is slow going up the stairway
for these folks and
the wooden stairway uh
when when you're helping people up it
like the stairway wasn't made to handle
the weight of more than
three people let's just be careful
getting up there um
alex here tie the rope up the top at
least in case this thing collapses
all right and i'll i'll i'll i'll be up
at the top and uh
and secure the rope okay toss it down
the length of the stairs just in case
secure to the bottom all right um
so when they get up to the top most
of these people are sitting down
and they uh
uh they are they're they're
essentially
like sitting there waiting like
trying to figure out
what's next like what are they gonna do
go in the kitchen get some water get
some food first fellas
then that's for you we weren't here we
didn't release you you've never seen us
before
so you are faced alexandra with the
absurd tableau
of donnell kneeling down to this
starving barely functional man saying
go make yourself some food buddy and
then andrew
j alexander just gonna sigh and go and
find her way back to the kitchen and uh
try to find anything that isn't spoiled
uh you find yeah you find some fruit
that is
okay and um
you know anything else you'd have to
cook okay
uh there isn't any bread or anything
like that there's no bread
uh they use rice not bread fair enough
okay i'll i'll load up a tray with as
much stuff as i can find that's any good
and carry it back
along with like a pitcher of water
the water for sure yeah they they so
there is a
they all just like dive in and start
devouring it in a like
carefully eat eat carefully if you
eat too much too fast you'll throw it
back up and you'll be worse off
actually they'll rupture their stomachs
and then die that too
uh luckily it seems like yeah it seems
like there's
enough of them and not quite enough food
to not have that be a problem
um so um
they are they're like eating now
and trying to like function yeah
now now that they are at least up the
stairs
i think that that i feel well enough to
leave
yes apart let's let's leave this it's
not here
it's not here it's at one of the clubs
we don't know which one
great all right um
do
who was upstairs
oh you had to ask that question yes i
did
because these people were servants
cooks we saw what happened to mr wu we
saw our translator
was that person in the bed alive that's
my question yes
i wouldn't be surprised if it's someone
that looks like ammo to be honest
but however it is someone else we can
ask
the question of where these things might
be
if they're alive let's do this
let's go oh upstairs quickly and and and
i'll go up and
carefully step over the tripwire and
keeping an eye out for any others
okay you you make your way up and you're
would you would you hold the light
for me all right
hold the match carefully just behind us
all right so you step in and you strike
a match
um and the figure in the bed does not
move okay
is she breathing you do not see
breathing
although it's dark there's you know and
it's a huge bed who could tell
i'm yeah i'm i'm gonna get closer
carefully dagger dagger back in my hand
uh i'm gonna let's rotate i'll go the
other side of the bed
so opposite sides of the bed okay
uh which one of you is on the figure
side
uh which which side is is it in is it in
the center or is it right or left
it's on the left side i'll go right side
i'll be on the left then
all right so um
you come up and oh dear
there's a kitten you come up
it's clear to you that whoever is on
this bed has had their neck broken
because the legs are facing
you know out towards the bed and the
head is facing in towards the bed
okay i'm i'm gonna get closer and like
lean so i can see the face match up so
she can
get a better look all right so you you
bring a match across the bed
uh and it is a mannequin
with a wig that makes it kind of look
like emma
and with like
no you did bring that note here would
you want to leave that
here perhaps we knew we'd come here
it seems likely that said do we want to
leave it
when the thing that we are looking for
isn't here yeah
true honestly
yes does not mention taking anything
did it i mean i i didn't read it
because because emma handed it to me
sealed
no it doesn't okay maybe we leave it far
here
you drop the note on the bed
and you hear madame lin's voice uh
it seems like coming through the
you said this would hello i know you're
there
i'll i'll i'll i'll like lean and blow
out the match just in case she's able to
see it
and and like as quietly as i said this
stupid magic stuff would work
just back away but i'm listening
intently because i don't know who she's
talking to
who knows magic
[Music]
you said this would hello
i can't hear anything both of you
make me stealth rolls
good yeah regular success
and the inspiration just jumps off the
table
second excellent excellent 42 barely
made it
all right yeah no i can't what
slowly open the curtain and let's just
slip right in
i'm actually going to hesitate like
right at the curtain and listen for a
minute to see if she identifies who
she's talking to or perhaps kills them
uh neither one of those become clear um
um you hear her say uh
you said it would activate if anyone
came close to the bed so did someone
and you yeah she's just human okay like
like a part of me is petty and
and wants to say something but also
there's a lot of people downstairs that
that will be in the crossfire if we do
something so
yeah right now yeah i'm gonna put them
put a hand on donald's forearm and just
like
out right you guys
disappear so are you going back to the
truck
what are you going to do let's go back
to the different one
all right so yeah you make it back to
the truck again there's
uh nobody in here the um
the the sad emaciated staff are starting
to try to figure out like
how to get out of here and where to go
and
yeah i'll i'll i'll leave doors open as
as we go because i imagine they know the
house they've
they've worked for a significant amount
of time did we pass the bathrooms at any
point like where flint was taking baths
yeah that was on the second floor okay
and there was no sign of the statue
there because that's where i would put
it if i were pettying her
better times much better times
i was human and then you were a gorilla
taking baths
less better times but still better times
so yeah come come come back out along
along the side you know get and get back
over same way as before
and just hoof it for the truck back to
the truck
yeah you get back there is a noted
lack
there is a notable lack of two foot tall
oh look no look you guys were gone
forever
we've searched the entire house that's
not there and most of the belongings
that you have the precious belongings
everything's been cleared out she's
taken over apparently everything got
we know where one of them is she may
have taken it there because it was the
last place that she saw emma
so are we not doing the ritual today
well we were planning we weren't going
to do this ritual
today anyway we have the other ritual to
do are we getting yeah are we getting to
cairo to fuse the
stones spill blood
the sun we're ahead of cairo right
now but i don't know how many hours
maybe
six hours drop some more we are
almost out of time i think yeah i think
we need to go
but what i mean what's the time
difference between here and and cairo
uh you can make me an intelligence role
we're all here we're all here so yeah
man uh
critical success six hours made in excel
so if it's 10 am in shanghai it's four
in the morning
in cairo oh perfect we have more time
tonight
we know how long it's going to take to
fuse those uh
fuse the the rocks that you have
well if we do it the the japanese way
with molten gold it shouldn't take long
just let it do we have open gold let's
get out of here let's go back to the uh
let's go the place washington dc though
right
i went last time with you doctor all
right
um i i'm guessing we can find a pay
phone pretty close to
uh where i
rented the truck from so i can drop it
off yeah sure you you find that
i'm so responsible
yeah we're cause we're civilized damn it
that's that's nick's character just kind
of in a nutshell they always want to
return the
the rented stuff and as we're going
i'll say quietly to emma
i delivered the letter she had one for
us
delivered in one of the most horrifying
thing ways i've ever seen
wha what oh god i don't even want to
know i do want to know but i don't want
to know what did she do and what did it
say
so i'll i'll pull the the folded note
out and say
in her basement there was a
dungeon of some variety that's the only
word that i can find to describe it it
was a wall
of bars and there were people inside and
they've been there for about a week
or so um
and they they were the ones who told us
that she cleared out all of the things
in the house and took them somewhere
probably to our clubs they couldn't tell
us where
and when we got the door open to help
them out this was inside and
i'll hand them at the note okay and i'll
literally i don't know what it said but
i'll literally reiterate kind of what
alexander said because you do like
i i think it was i knew you couldn't
resist helping them
why won't emma love me or something very
similar to that and i'll
feel like because you do things like
this yeah and and i just like laugh and
say
that's right i said yes throw it out the
truck
just throw it on the ground and just be
like yeah all right it's yeah it's gone
uh okay so you call
you call rogers up and yeah a door
will appear
all right and so you you are now in dc
um some of you for the first time are
catching a glimpse of the portal machine
that is a some sort of wheelchair
apparatus
with kefur and yusef sitting back to
back
with like electrodes and pipes and wires
and they both are semi-conscious
at best and they both
um they both look like they've aged
a great deal goodness do they look
emaciated like are they getting fed it
seems like they're getting fed yeah
uh they're you know like their bodies
are under
all sorts of strain yep i turned to
rogers and be like are you
do you let them out of this contraption
or
oh raw actually rogers is not there
there's some poor tech guy
who is there and he
he looks at dr hollister and he says
well it depends did has rogers made
the provisions for cairo uh
to the as i understand it to the
extent he could
now that's promising i suppose we should
go through with it
whereas rogers anyway uh
commander rogers is uh
he's at a meeting with the with the
oh i will i will leave him a note with
the sketch of the
jade statue all right doctor why don't
we just wait for him and speak to him
before we
hop again we don't have time
we're running out of time yeah we have
no idea how long
even with the six hour jump we still
can't remember we have to potentially
clear out the area
of any i turned back to the tech
the armory do we have flame throwers oh
god
and emma is just like over there
grinning her flamethrowers
make her name dr hollister i want
grenades
roll for grenades i made that luck roll
uh not ask for grenades uh
yeah we have a couple of of uh
flamethrowers i bet those are good at
clearing out evil
can any of you use a flamethrower not to
save my life
uh okay yeah emma's got flame
volunteers as she yeah
no i don't think we know how to use it
but we have a volunteer
wait a minute i'm pretty sure these
things
i rolled for grenades i made it thank
you libras arcana
she does not get grenades yeah
actually the guy will oh it's that
that's emma
that's emma oh i'm sorry ma'am we have
no grenades
what how about a bicycle i'm afraid
i'm not supposed to give you a bicycle
either
apparently the last two we gave you
did not return
i suppose you wouldn't have camels here
either
uh the only camel we have is in the
experimentation wing
no that's okay no let's go stock up on
some equipment before we jump back to
this portal
all right so there are yeah there are
two flamethrowers
which are terrifying they are i get one
and 55 gallon drums of
petroleum attached to your back
with a with a a
a gun of sorts that is essentially a
pilot light
and expectorant that show shoots out
more grab one end i grab one end and
just and like
look at the the 55 gallon tank you go i
i miss flint flint could carry that
thing no problem that's when i get more
ammunition i would count his
side too if it went off he would be he'd
there's a way to get rid of all that
hair i'm sorry sorry i disappointed
more importantly there is a manual for
that flamethrower right
oh yes there's a there's a training
manual that has like tabs
uh acronyms i'm like pumping the
gasoline thing and being like the
trigger's right here right
i'm going to stay well away from that
and look for it yeah
yeah yeah i i i've got my trusty weapon
so i'm i'm good
there's a fine collection of uh
of rifles and pistols you know you can
if you need to stock up
i'll i'll kind of upgrade what i've got
right now
first a little better i have been
blessed enough to not
have to use what i already have with me
so i'm good
and i hand emma that instruction manual
he hands you a binder with like 200
sheets of paper in it
trust me yeah you're wearing the suicide
backpack
read this okay and then i think to
myself this is gonna be great kindling
[Laughter]
um i'll i'll grab a 38
uh revolver and and some bullets for it
is there any
if i were able to find a hunting knife
would i be able to hide that about my
person
we're not going somewhere where you need
to hide it
i mean with cairo
we don't think we're we're going to like
you have the guy asks for the
coordinates of where you're going
i'm sure someone knows the coordinates
of the pyramid
i would have that in the notes wouldn't
i or
relatively close like we know the town
that we took the camels out to
yeah you can you can definitely get to
the town
yeah because well the thing is is we
wouldn't want to get there and not be
able to call back and have no camels
correct no so we need to go to town and
and that's one of the reasons time is of
the essence why
because we have to take camels from them
to the pyramid
you got my request for alcohol that's my
time
i did not even hear that where yeah
where are the things that
he that they were supposed to give us to
take out there
or are we going to meet people out there
there should we should meet people out
there
rogers should have made arrangements
according to we can wait for rogers
to finish this meeting a few minutes is
there something not on your requisition
form
are you gonna tell them about the blood
of the innocent is that on somewhere on
this list
no that that that is the thing on the
list yeah i think the whole list
and a drum a drum we had the pot in the
pan drum
a drum so the only thing that i see on
the requisition list that is waiting for
you
uh in the village is a large kettle
drum
ah okay great whoa no it needs to be
pretty much
i specified fresh kettle drum kettle
drum
i don't know it's a drum drum rodgers a
requisition
for for having some form of blood
uh i'm afraid sir that we don't have
blood you have innocent people
written down on that list
we're gonna have to break and we're
gonna have to wait for rogers to come
out of his meeting
um where is his meeting
no war department yeah
what time is it here oh god it is the
should be yesterday yeah it's yesterday
kind of almost evening
almost evening god i'm gonna go
i mean i think i have some i should be
able to get some cash fairly easily go
to a pawn shop and grab some
gold coins or something i was going to
ask if they had gold bars here
i no we have some gold if you need it i
don't know what you
would need it for it's quite heavy yes
we do need some gold
um well we also need a way to melt it we
may want to do that here
emma's got a flamethrower yeah no
you can adjust the nozzle and basically
use it i mean no just with the little uh
it'd be a good practice a little bunsen
burner
it's it's not a blender there aren't
settings
fricassee
[Laughter]
yeah emma is blow up the universe
i think on the top setting is emma
i think we're gonna go to break
so we will be back just first of
all
we're giving away those libraries nice
zac first of all we need thomas second
of all we're giving away those libras
arcana dice so hashtag
chaos to be entered into wait wait wait
wait
everybody wait one second thomas is
giving me the hold on i haven't
put the words in the in the thing huh
set it up hi hold on how's everybody
doing
fine
it will be at a certain point hashtag
chaos in the chat i've been told okay
he's ready
i've been told i'm i'm hearing now that
uh it is hashtag chaos in the chat to
win those libras arcana dice that amy
has rolled exactly once
yeah exactly yeah it rolled well but
they still i was still denied
grenades they they didn't roll well
enough to
unfortunately uncle dr hollister was
on to you
uh we will be back just as soon as six
people can use six bathrooms
six one two three four yeah six there
[Music]
and that's why you always leave a note
welcome back we are excited to say
that our buddy seth in gc
five seven seven four four four
five seven is that like a star trek ship
it's what i thought yeah but i
believe it's actually a stellar
uh designation i think he i think he
reminded he told me what it was once
and like the horrible person i am i said
huh that's interesting and then
immediately forgot it
honestly the only reason that i remember
it at all is that 457 was the first
three numbers of my house number when i
was a kid
so if you want to order this which
doesn't say anything because in
fairbanks alaska a lot of the numbers
are four five seven
is it your password now nope oh it is
i use i use other numbers for my
password
uh so congratulations seth
um let us know in the chat whether you
want amy to actually roll the dice or
not
anymore anymore um
i've been told actually this is really
appropriate seth being
our oh gosh i hope i can say amateur
astronomer i don't know if he's a
professional but
uh the dice this month that libra
sakana has
are called the perseids and they have a
like a a stellar motif so it it uh
it works out perfectly yeah that's
stellar haha i see what you did there
was in the stars you're too far away
from me to throw something at you
uh i would like it to take a minute to
upgrade
every single person in the chat who was
involved in that flamethrower discussion
uh
not what we're about people go play
world war two larps
[Laughter]
right
so i ran a game at dunder con one year
that was a world war ii game and i will
never run a world war ii game again
because
there were two randos at the table
there were two people who were like this
is awesome let's tell a story
and then there was one guy who's like i
don't think a sherman tank could uh
do that in that rifle caliber is not and
it's like
you know what there also aren't things
with wings trying to
carve the tank open versamilitude is not
what call of cthulhu is about
well and and as nick pointed out very
accurately the the universe where all of
that was true where all of the things
that you expect to happen have happened
that was the universe that emma
destroyed yeah in this universe
where who knows besides everyone
knows flamethrowers come from atlantis
a lot of fire down there
they have to stay warm somehow it's all
thermal
there it is it's all thermals yeah uh
all right so you are
uh you're waiting for rogers to
return
um and he will um
yeah he'll get back and he's he's he's
like ah dr hollister and he looks at
i'm the i'm the patient i'm i'm fine i'm
fine if it didn't work
but i'm still fine it didn't work no
the the surger the surgery was
successful but
the goals we were trying to achieve with
the surgery
were not successful the infections back
i mean successful i suppose i didn't die
in the surgery
um it's still there i see
all right well i have something
i'm glad that you're all here do you
have
that capstone that you need put back
together
we're there if you don't mind there's
the capstone
i think i think this could this could
really help
um you're welcome to observe if you want
um it could be a little troubling
well do you want i can just say it if
you want i don't yeah
i mean i thought it was just gold that
you
no no there's a ritual to put this back
together
and we require a great deal of
what we're calling arcane energy
and you happen to have taken care
of a great source of arcane energy
to
in a way bring people back from the dead
so we have we've harnessed the arcane
what what does that mean you have the
papers on this
it's pretty clear we have
we we have made a zombie out of edward
gavigan
and we use him as a battery for arcane
energy
look you people were complaining about
what we did to those two civilians
no it's it's it's fascinating i just
personally have an aversion to zombies
but i mean gavigan was horrible in life
maybe he can be useful in death
i just would love to see the research on
this
we can we can get that to you but um
uh so this would be a fabulous test
i want to take a look at this and see
what you've done
all right so you
um you're brought into a a pretty
nondescript conference room
and lying on a on a gurney
is the very bullet-ridden uh
corpse of edward gavigan who
uh is clearly dead but is also clearly
hooked up to a machine that looks
similar to the portal machine
that they are involved in now
as you come in rogers is there and he
goes over
he talks to a tech for a minute
and he says now obviously
gavigan can't actually perform any magic
like this
so we have a practitioner
uh and it is
uh this is all very theoretical this is
really a test of this so
um if you don't mind put the capstone
there on that table
and the tech pulls out
a musty like ancient tome
and starts like flipping through pages
and
he he looks up a little and then um
they attach somehow
uh it looks like a blood transfusion
almost
uh they connect him to gavigan attack
they connect the tactic they connect the
tech to gavigan
uh and um
and the ga and gavigan
uh the body of gavigan like tenses
and the text starts to read out of the
manual
and he starts to like go
on and on about this and
[Music]
what the hell number is this well d20
knows would say hang on a d20 doesn't
work i can't roll an 11 and a 9.
um yeah so anybody who made it
um it's clear that this room has two-way
glass
so there is somebody watching what's
going on in here rogers is in here with
you
um and the tech like starts to falter
and alexandra and emma
you hear a familiar voice come over a
loud speaker
from the next room distinctly
you hear professor aldridge
say no you didn't say that right go
back
two paragraphs and and say it
properly
i like reach over and grab at emma's
shoulder just like
like oh my god a voice from the grave
yeah like and of course you wouldn't
of course you would say that do i
notice them getting weirded out or
anything
what now do i notice them getting
weirded out or anything
it's pretty clear alexandra reacts very
strongly
oh wow and
uh and
it the text starts again
and messes it up again and the door
opens
and in walks professor aldridge uh
looking exactly as
some of you remember her she walks
right up to the tech
and she just looks at him and pulls the
needle out of his arm
and sticks it in her own
idiom that's a strong reaction to
needles
and and then
to sort of almost under her breath um
she says
she was right about blood magic and she
starts to read
uh she starts to read the thing and
and in the
the seam between the two you
you placed it on the table and it's
about a quarter inch apart
uh and as she is chanting
the seam starts to glow green
between the two and as you are watching
the stone
lifts up and comes together
and there is a s and it is seamlessly
connected
and as soon as she stops speaking the
galvin corpse
uh flops back down and she
pulls the thing out and she says and she
looks at the tech and she says
you've got to make sure that you know
how to pronounce six consonants in a row
i want to look at that book do you know
we did i want to read up on how they're
preserving the body where they can
transfuse the blood
so who was that we'll tell you
i want to see that book joan is just
laser focused he doesn't give a uh
uh the tech has collected the book
back up and he's starting to like
get gavigan together to like roll him
out uh
rogers to your question hollister roger
say um
we found that the the process
that we were able to go through with
gavigan
uh there's no he has no brain function
at all but
uh everything else in his body seems to
be functioning
fairly normally and we're still
it's still highly theoretical but
there's some connection between
arcane energy and and blood
doesn't look like it he's functioning as
a battery
i i think that's right he's functioning
as a battery
you dug him up i crashed him up
i thought we had buried him oh you're
right you did
damn it yes we found the body
uh in the process of destroying that
location
we we were able to ascertain that he
was
an incredibly powerful practitioner
and we've had some men working on
the theory of this it was based on
something i heard you all talk about
with those
staves that could take energy out of
people
yeah yeah we're you know we're working
on the idea
of arcane practitioners being
like those two fellows out there with
the door
yes if you know if this idea can work
out
then we can repurpose people like
gavigan
and not have to use people like
so i've i've we found this gentleman
named stanford which might actually be
a excellent substitute candidate
yes if we can kill him
yep well do we have to kill captain or
captain
he knows who stanford is he already
knows
we're well aware of carl stanford he's
um he's been running he before he got
involved with
uh this group he was involved with a
uh occult small time really
the knights of the silver twilight they
were uh
they were doing some recruiting in the
east coast trying to bring in
uh people when when his scheme started
to fall apart stanford had disappeared
for a while and
so now we just have to solve the blood
problem
oh the blood oh the innocent blood yeah
so
we have not been able to manufacture
anything synthetic
and refrigeration is the real issue well
what does innocent really mean for this
ritual do we have any
expertise is this a religious term or
something more fundamental
that's an interesting question i um
let's uh
uh let's get some people working on that
um where can i
send you a tele are you gonna are you in
we were we're here we were thinking
about taking a gate directly to
egypt to try to perform the ritual to
cap the stone
tonight well tomorrow night
tomorrow night in in this time but
and tell you that we are um
we're trying to limit the double hops as
they seem to be
especially stressful on
that's fine when's a good time for us to
leave
well we're not gonna make it important
you need to leave
sooner rather than later but but
research uh
on things like the the arcane meaning
of the term innocent that's gonna take
some time
so so if we can't make it
tonight then we should forego the hop
entirely
so but then we should what actually we
should do is look for more pieces of
things so maybe we can do more
well i i left the notes to construct the
jade statue of the bloated woman
assuming we can't find it in shanghai
which
i think is a yeah healthy and safe
assumption i think we could find it
if we if we spent the time tossing her
clubs but
that's a dangerous endeavor very
dangerous
you know what she would ask for right it
and she imprisons her staff in the
i'm like trying to think of like a crazy
yeah yeah it was just like a madame lynn
yep classic madame lynn
our intelligence tells us that she
pretty much runs shanghai now
talking now on and that she's a gorilla
yes yep that's correct and she's not
hiding it
also correct that's concerning
uh we're we're trying we're we're trying
to
not let that news get out around here
uh we don't want to we don't want people
to start thinking about
crazy things like that like what
like like people being gorillas
why don't you just make one of your
we can do that you just have to kill her
oh rodgers knows that already yeah that
was already explained
sorry i've got a lot going on yeah uh
yes uh
killing her killing her
i literally roll my eyes like you have
yusuf and dr kaffor
in some torture thing you dug up dead
zombie
penhue and you have a problem killing a
megalomaniac
in shanghai who's also a gorilla torture
device
you misunderstand it's not
a it's not a difficult proposition
morally it's a difficult proposition
financially and physically
the united states of america is not we
would essentially she controls
the entire police force of shanghai
and she is centralizing power
with the new the new china front has
been shattered
and so she is centralizing power
our current theory is that she's making
a deal with the japanese
did rogers meet you as a gorilla oh yeah
rogers contemplated killing him to
become a gorilla
yeah it was very clearly written across
his eyes yeah all right
uh thorn castle went over to the
japanese
well he didn't go over he's just
i don't know what thorn castle does half
the time
well he was trying to figure out you
posed something that your second half
didn't
finish i'm honestly amazed by how much
you're
you're forgetting you got angry at us
for him for him going and thus losing a
delta green operative
this is another clone of rogers and
alexander's just watching yes
you're not my only team all right
thorncast is going to try to get
japanese cooperation so he says and
hopefully he'll be successful and we'll
have we'll have their assistance
uh look i'm ex
i'm ecstatic the gavigan test was
perfect
uh it went well and
you've got your capstone you just need
to find
innocent blood in egypt
[Music]
egypt of all places or
we still need innocent blood yeah i was
about to say innocent blood this month
or innocent blood that month is
not still problem tomorrow i mean
you could you could just pay volunteers
if you if you have enough people you
don't need that much
that's true and i think that will
probably be
our best option to get as many people as
we can and pay them
just offer 100 just offer a 100
villagers 10 bucks i think the screening
process is more
the issue right now so we do need to
figure out what innocent means
that's the thing could there be some
other religious acolytes or
seminary students or something to that
effect
that would be increased
well you did talk about you know
children and things like that
and then and then we stopped talking
about children and things like that
yeah that's a little too uncomfortable
for even me yeah i think i think
children is a hard pass
i mean yeah maybe the seminary what
about those
uh what about those guys you met
i mean i i suppose it depends on how
many of their people they could rally to
do it and whether or not they would be
welcome
whether or not they would be willing to
after the sword of Akmala
incident yes hey where is the sword of
akhmale
that's going to be a fun conversation in
cairo
i'm looking at my current sword like how
do i disguise this isn't like the sword
of okama now
we could probably get it engraved and
just do the same thing again
yeah that's all the sword of Akmala
was sure elder signs all we need
yep you know that's a great idea if
we are stuck here for like a month we
should
i'd be up for that rogers would love
to know about the elder sign you
never
he never got a chance to use the or get
to know the elder sign
uh ritual that's the kind of thing that
he would love to mass produce
that'd be really useful honestly yes it
i'd have to i'd have to search it a
little bit more because
other people were more grounded in that
than i was i was more of a helper on
that one well but
you have you have silvano's notes i know
i said i'm going to have to take a look
and that would just be a matter of time
yes yeah
there's there's that woman though that
you just saw the the
the mage woman who was just here
so that's a good question who of you who
remember professor aldridge
remember an aspiring sorcerer who
did not seem to have any ability
uh and was somewhat frustrated by that
yes frustrated is a good word
yeah alexandra is going to just like
look down in a way to the side
just yeah no that's a good question
it seems like she seemed i mean she
was able to put the stone together maybe
she could tell us and then
if we find anything else broken we can
i mean i i guess that depends on whether
um
the same idea of hooking gavigan
into a caster for lack of a better term
is going to work for something like an
elder sign like it did for putting that
thing back together
i don't see any reason why it wouldn't
but that is a question
yeah it would be an interesting test of
the
and it would also we've had some
questions
about whether or not for lack of a
better word whether or not arcane energy
was
uh tainted by the individual
and it would be an interesting test to
see if we could use gavigan's power to
create protective items
again i i genuinely hope that we can
because that's what that thing is
i'll point over at the capstone yeah
that would be cool they're worth a shot
well all right then are you headed to
uh egypt then i don't know
like we don't have the time today so we
shouldn't do a jump
and hang out there for a month yeah
uh you should know that the situation in
egypt is
uh as always
from places that you've left somewhat
unstable uh
there was an attempt by a uh
by a a an expeditionary force
to take over cairo that the
uh mr thorn castle and mr concannon and
some compatriots mostly
thwarted however the um
the army of the black pharaoh has
uh there's a rebellion going on in
egypt right now and the the army of the
black pharaoh
who styled them who framed themselves
as freedom fighters
are currently fighting to take over
now we can't be there for very long
we're going to have to jump in and jump
out guys
i agree all right honestly our best
option if we're not going to make it
this time
is to stay here for
a week maybe a week and a half work on
on some of the things like the elder
signs maybe let people have a look at
silvano's notes
um try to harness some of this stuff get
ourselves properly prepared
because that's one thing that we
consistently mess up on is preparation
and we've been thrown into a lot of
difficult situations
we don't need to be in cairo do we
i don't think so except what
i mean unless the unless the the the
knights
of Akmala are who you're going to get
your innocent blood from
then we have to go there but we have
some
time if we're not if if we're not going
to try to hit
today's full moon we have time
yes to recruit people
we have time to figure out all this
stuff
uh let's see who would make this role i
i think alexandra you're the main one to
make this role make me
a let's call it an education role
education sure what would
what could i roll for like a time
management role to kind of
management
you need to roll silvano that's all you
need to roll time management accounting
um are you do you mean you want to like
figure out the best way to like
optimize your time as you're figuring
out like okay if we take a week here
the travel time like factor in
some delays and then the travel like
getting to each of the places
plus stopping by and being like oh you
know
yeah this will leave us this many days
or it's like actually we're going to be
short a day or two
maybe we need to speed this up a little
bit just so we don't find out that we're
uh are you talking like project
management stuff
i pull out one of my notebooks it has
um i i made that education i saw that
don't worry yeah
okay i'm gonna start by saying yes
to nothing in particular
and then i'm going to say
with the education role you have
noticed that every time that you have
said hey rogers
we have this cool thing that maybe you
could work with that cool thing has no
longer been yours it becomes
so don't tell rogers no well so here's
here here's the conundrum and i'm going
to say this out of the game
dr hollister just said don't tell rogers
yeah i'm going to say this out of game
the conundrum that i am running into
is that delta green is better equipped
better funded
better able to experiment with this sort
of stuff
um every time that we have done major
workings something has gone very very
very wrong so it's called the gm
on on on the one hand a part of a part
of me
wants to withhold information from
rogers on the other hand
we theoretically work for him and
he is better equipped funded prepared
and all the other stuff
to mass-produce elder signs to
uh figure out all of this stuff do i
agree with his methods not even a little
bit
what we need we need these guys yeah so
but we can make them we can make them
yes but it's a
huge drain on us if we can use gavigan
as a battery since we no longer have the
staves or the headdress or any of the
things that let us do it without
consequence like oh i don't know losing
pow
um if if we if we can figure out a way
for them to mass produce elder science
and give each of us one
i'm fine with that why don't we start
just to remember elder signs are
essentially site-specific
so like having one just carrying one
around doesn't do a lot for you
it's we put an elder sign on this this
space and it will keep this space from
happening or things can't cross this
threshold or that sort of thing right
right so if we have this we have to put
it somewhere it doesn't it's not like
attached to me
but we could but we could attach it to
like a place that that we're staying in
order to keep something
uh that is that that that it would block
from coming out we've done that before
yeah we that's one of the things that
we've done is made elder signs it
so it's going to be it's starting to
get into the evening
uh here at in washington
so if you are going to go to cairo
let's die i think we should stay yeah
what's what's my what's my product
management role
uh let's call it um
i mean really it's accounting but you
don't want to roll accounting uh
that would have been you know back
uh critical success yeah
so you have yeah you figured out that
you know you're
you're you're coming up with okay if we
get
elder sign production down to this this
many days
um now all of your computations are
taking into effect
that you're giving delta green
all of the information you know you're
sort of giving them the stuff to do it
uh no my calculations are we talk
directly with
the professor yeah but she
works for aldridge
yeah oh okay yeah you can she works for
delta grain she will give them
everything that we give
her that she is she is a rogers truther
she
is but we it's
still more time efficient to cut out the
middleman sure yeah
i don't want to hand over everything i
just want to hand it over i mean if we
can make a mimeo if we can
i don't want to hand everything over i
but you know if we could make a mimeo or
if we could
there was some way to there's some way
to
make another copy this version of
reality at this time
yeah there are many machines yeah and
joan
if i mean you could still make these
using without loss of anything on your
end
we could use gavigan and you wouldn't be
losing any
strength or whatever it is all you have
to do is plug gavigan into your arm
yeah that's fun that is my primary
concern right now
is i don't know what happens when you
connect up to that person and we have
fought him directly like aldridge didn't
in any universe just so like out of
character
i think that joan would actually
probably know that it probably wouldn't
work
there's there's no there's no will to
draw from it it would come from it would
come from joan
if we plug joan into it well and that's
why i wanted to talk to the professor
more about that because i'm fascinated
about how that had happened
and and silvano's notes if you
actually go through them
are very fixated or even obsessed with
that
yeah about the loss of pal and yes yes
you know
all that stuff yes yes so that's what i
would talk to her about
and as part of our research and part of
our
oh we should work together that's what i
would do it sounds like you guys
aren't you guys aren't going to cairo
today
we would be cutting it too close there's
no way that we could do everything that
needs to have blood
in order to do this ritual in the next
like seven hours
so rogers it's now you know past dinner
he's gonna set you up
with a place to stay they have like
they have some barracks here
so he will he will set you up here um
and you know he i'll go home yeah that's
right this yeah dr hollister can
actually go home
um and i want to cut to a vignette
so you guys have been sent to the
barracks
uh you've got your your places you're
given
uh these id cards that you're supposed
to wear at all times
um it's about two in the morning
and alexandra you wake up and you notice
that
donal is not in the room
i'm i'm i'm i'm gonna sit bolt up right
and look around because
i expect to see him there and just yeah
you know see he's not in there all right
i'm gonna slip and slip out of bed
um i imagine i'm in my pajamas but i
grab
one of my daggers and just like pat pad
barefoot over to the door
and start looking around okay you
open the door
and you see donald head down a
does he look like he's moving oddly
no all right i'm gonna follow him
okay quietly uh
tom i'm gonna change your idea a little
bit but it's gonna be mostly the same
uh so you follow from a distance and by
the time you get there
um you you
you cr you pass two guards that have
i'll i'll pause long enough to like
check their pulse and make sure they're
they're not dead they're unconscious
yeah
you pause and so with those pauses
you come into the lab where the portal
machine is
and you see that a door has been opened
and you see donald
pushing yousef and kafur through a door
and on the other side of the door you
see carl stanford
as he pushes the portal machine through
the door
and then closes the door and then his
neck
collapses
i'm going to drop my dagger and just run
to him
he is he's he's he's alive the
back of his neck
yeah oh well so i'm in that room that's
what what what what what what happened
what happened
what happened to me what do you remember
i was asleep i i i just woke up what
where are we i have a son of a
what happened i woke up
you were gone and
i came into the room in time to see you
pushing dr kufur and joseph through an
open portal to carl sanford now that
that
that doesn't make any sense what what do
you i push what did i do
i'm gonna like gently touch the back of
his neck by burns
oh god oh god i think you served the
purpose
that's stanford had for you
what's roger's going to do i don't know
probably recreate it with other people
stanford stanford has those those two he
has those too
they're in danger we're all in danger
yes
uh at that point a bell an alarm bell
starts to ring throughout the base um
you are all the rest of you wake up
and you hear you hear an alarm bell
and you all notice that alexandra and
donald are missing
oh crap what they do now exactly
you can't get in trouble for stealing
stuff from the from the commissary
can you now this is worse yeah oh man
they found alcohol who do you think we
you still you're still not going to get
an alarm for alcohol
does emma wake up cuddling the
flamethrower tank
yeah actually i spent the rest of my day
looking for like a little cart that i
can carry the gallon around
behind me like a little wagon nice yeah
there's
you have a little like radio flyer that
is following you around with it
is there a phone or something in this
room we can use the contact
security or whatever yeah you pick yeah
there's a phone that goes right to the
front
i'll pick it up i'm gonna go to the door
right yes yeah let's go the hallway
let's go outside
see what's up it's here the the portal
room this is where the problem um
tell rogers this it's bad it's bad
sen said rogers here all right so
uh yeah there will be very quickly there
will be
um three or four soldiers in there with
with with the big guns
uh and you guys follow a trail
of met of of guards being tended to
medically that have like medics
looking at them
um and you get to the portal room and
you immediately notice that the portal
and there are guards that are
semi-politely talking to donald and
alexandra
while semi politely not pointing their
guns directly at them
yeah and and and alexander is very
carefully holding her hands away from
her side
to make sure that they know she's not
armed at the moment
dagger's closer to the door i assume
that i'm going to get a phone call very
soon
is that the doctor yes dr hollister
we need you
at the base now
i'll wait okay i wake up and i get my
car with my jammies still on
nice all right and an overcoat and a
g-man overcoat
[Laughter]
um and the guards
are clearly not they're just like trying
to get figure out the the who what when
and where and why
they don't really understand the
any of the significance or anything like
that um
that they stole something some what what
happened
guys i i imagine we're being kept apart
at the moment by the guard
yeah the guards won't let you the
they're like from those two
uh rogers rogers will come in a
little before hollister
um i got a report on the way over here
what the hell did you do con cannon
i i was i was i was asleep but it it
it
used me the whatever this thing on my
neck was if you were compromised
the next thing is take a look take just
look at this thing
was your plan to come here and triple
our operation
we wouldn't have sent him here
previously to have the surgery done a
dangerous
surgery if it was if it was the
intention
to compromise in the middle of of the
place
this is a setback a major setback
understand we know
on top of that stanford
apparently has the portal machine now
and dr caffor and joseph yes
yes and stanford is highly intelligent
he'll figure out how to work it
undoubtedly i mean he figured it out
well enough to get the
the portal open i don't think donald
knew how to open the portal
well i guess
it's a good thing dr hollister was
working on all our alternate timelines
and all almost like a summons i'm in
and your life's work
is not in this room for the first time
in
well i guess months really i don't think
it's because rogers has taken my advice
no you don't i suspect
what happened here doctor look
i'll look at my neck just look at this
place
so now it doesn't look like a tattoo it
looks like a brand
there's like a burning in there oh
i thought it was gone but it's still
there oh
it looks like yes uh
so it is now it's just like the
residue
of the tattoo from the burn so there's
it's like brand is too strong it's
like scar
kind of scar tissue whatever's there is
gone i think
i think is the energy in the form of the
brand
like is it just kind of multi molten
seeping out like what's the
what's the deal it seems like it's now
normal skin like his skin
i think it was a a one use activation
only to get stan
to get donald to do whatever stanford
needed him to
i hope that's i hope you're right well
you're
it it looks like your skin again it
hurts you
didn't to have it touched well we're
going to do a lot of tests
and tend to it
well i mean the easiest way to solve
this problem is kill stanford
we know where he is yes now we can't get
there easily
not without rebuilding that thing and
now he can run away
easily anywhere we're gonna need
cart horse i'm feeling stanford's the
answer here
yeah but we we we're gonna have to get
there and
is that egypt without a month
i'm working on donald while we're having
this
um so it seems like so the weirdest
part of all this
is that it seems that the skin graft
is completely gone oh i didn't say
looking i said working
oh i'm working i'm trying to i'm
patching him up
yeah so so
oh in terms of the keeping an
equipment and a pad
and yeah you are you're you're taking
care of
almost like it's almost rote for you to
kind of just you know not as you're
thinking
uh but i whisper
you know you're not getting that bottle
now
you know what sure
uh and so
you know at a certain point rogers is
just like
well we might as well all go back to bed
now we're now our timeline is weeks
wow that's all let's
all go go get some sleep i feel like
things will look if not
better at least more manageable in the
morning
after a drink you're gonna go get a
drink now
yeah i think this is a good time yeah
yeah there is
there is a there is a a uh
a commissary that has some not great
whiskey but yeah i'll i'll
i'll go with him scooping up my dagger
on
on the way out the door just like ben
scoop go okay
uh so this is now in washington
timeline time zones oh my god
all right is it the seventh or is it the
eighth because it would be the eighth
it was no because at in the morning in
cairo it was night
in the morning in shanghai it was the
previous night
in which was the seventh because it was
the eighth like we needed to get to
cairo on the eighth so it's now really
the morning of the eighth
no we needed to get there on the seventh
yeah the full moon was the seventh oh
okay sorry then all right i thought we
were one day ahead
tonight okay and
um let's day seven two
yeah and um
yeah there is uh
not even subtly there is a uh
there's a guard following donald
everywhere he goes
like standing outside your room and as
soon as donna leaves
he just starts walking with you and i'm
not
surprised that's fine
he's he's he's professionally
mildly apologetic about his duty but he
is not he's not fooling around don't
sweat it lad that's fine
i understand yeah and and and and to
help keep an eye on the guard and on
donald both for
for for different reasons alexandria is
never very far either
yeah all right so dr hollister
actually has a schedule of like how this
research could be put out
i think it is let me check the travel
thank you table of contents that was
very useful i love it
when there's a good table of contents so
uh
with with fair seas and good wins
uh it's about a 10-day trip from the us
to to port saeed cairo
um but with the north you know with the
north atlantic
as it normally is it's pretty much two
to three weeks
it's more in that range almost always um
rogers could put you on a navy ship
where you'd get there faster but it
would be a lot less comfortable
i don't care that's fine i would say
we'd have to because literally if it
takes three weeks that if we left today
we'd or tomorrow morning we'd arrive on
the 30th and we technically have
one full week to the new moon which is
june 6th
so we'd have to you must use the fastest
the new moon is not part of the of the
i'm sorry the full moon because the new
moon is in two weeks
right and then two weeks and two days
later is the full moon
yeah so he can he can get you on a navy
ship
uh that would that would make sure that
it is a
that is at most a two-week trip okay
what's the what's the what's the over
under on
if the the duchess is on this boat
hi very hot are there other blimps we
could use
perhaps well
don't don't talk about the duchess that
way
um so there there is a transatlantic
uh a zeppelin it's run by the germans
uh it is uh
you know it is uh
it doesn't travel it only travels from
new york
to london or to berlin
there's no direct service there's no
dirigible to
yeah good call though good call yeah
so i'm gonna
go to we can go to london and get on the
thanks but no that's a whole side
adventure
so i mean the um
you know i actually don't know how long
it took a transatlantic zeppelin trip
let's see i think they're slower it's
just luxurious
atlantic zeppelin
flight time wow no that's much faster
111 hours and 44 minutes that's great
uh that is from new jersey to
friedrichshafen
i'm so glad we have someone who speaks
german on this to actually try to get
that
right the very first commercial
passenger flight across the atlantic
went
from friedrichshafen 1928 but we're
going to bend that a little
uh and land at it left on october 11th
and it arrived in new jersey on october
15th
wow i like that let's do that
from germany we just take a train
down
south and then a boat or something uh
yeah from germany you could
take a train or you could yeah that
would be the most common was to take it
probably take a train down to italy and
then take a boat across the
mediterranean
wow that still would be faster huh
oh but hang on so it's a train to new
jersey which is a day
then three days across the atlantic then
a train
from germany to italy is probably what
like two days
in this time yeah not one day no it's
an overnight
okay maybe arrive in venice or something
take a boat from there yeah you could
pull into venice and then take a yeah
take a boat from there
that would be like maybe a week to
eight to nine days yeah ten days tops
yeah
i like that option if we can get
ourselves on that blimp
and bonus far lower chance of running
at least on that leg we still have one
um so you know rogers will be like
um zeppelin travel is
it's expensive but we can take care of
it if you want to go across it's it's
definitely for the upper crust
it's the safest way to travel they tell
us
for a while anyway god how is this gonna
go
we should still leave earlier oh no
i shouldn't take my flame thrower on the
zeppelin
that's the one thing we have to travel
light so customs is definitely a little
more
strict on the flamethrower
also post post-great war germany
uh is a little more stringent about
firearms
there's some military bases along the
way we could stop but it still
sounds like taking just taking the boat
and going
and not having to worry about changing
and going to different places just
get on the army boat and go
that's right but would allow us to bring
all of our gear with us so that is that
is a bonus
get on the navy boat and go yeah but the
last time we were on i mean need i
remind you the last time the last navy
boat we were on is now
what's the over under that stanford has
put that back together and is using it
for his own purposes
my idea was bad you made it worse
literally yeah
going around the east china sea that's
not a moon
that's a flesh star
[Laughter]
kill it with fire
[Music]
the aft of the book
you okay you okay there oh yes
that is unfortunate just breathe um
uh rogers i mean rogers will say that it
sounds like the zeppelin is the fastest
way
i've read your files and
things blow up buffer time
seems like it wouldn't hurt
what information i have i don't know
fascinating is the right word
if i can be abstract it was like reading
a train wreck
i mean to be fair living it felt like
living through a train wreck
there's a pirate ship remember that
pirate ship
sorry i try not to
there is there is a zeppelin leading
so we would need to leave tomorrow to
get on that i could probably arrange
well what do we have to do here still
yeah i mean are we going to mass
try and produce a
make copies of notes and leave them with
professor aldridge
are we going to try and make an elder
sign before we leave let's make an elder
sign why not
do you want the short list or the long
yeah
like the short list uh
takes a lot of power might leave someone
brain dead oh
a lot of that elders let it deal with
oh
i i i'm just going to leave that there
just let it give i could give them
that particular part i can make a copy
of that
well and again i i think i think i
honestly think it's a good idea
to get them copies of as much as we can
because silvano's whole thing
was training an army of sorcerers
that was his focus that's what octavian
told you you needed
and if that's who better to ask than
the military we need a lot more
yeah sorcerers then yeah they do seem to
be willing to work with them and
and and and weaponize them so
all right i will i'll make some notes
that's what i'll be doing nick
somewhat
okay very professional uh
a little very driven
okay kind of uh
uh doesn't have a lot of time for people
that
don't know as much as her ah
i mean i'm assuming i would not wish any
ill upon her
no okay no she's been a fine
uh you know a fine co-worker
um just from the comment of like we'll
dump that on her it's like
uh yeah alexandra has exactly the same
face
[Music]
we didn't get on but i wouldn't wish
if we crafted a few of those before we
if it's worked i mean joan knows
how to do this it shouldn't be a problem
magic hasn't seemed to work well for
you i would say
magic works we don't work well let's
rephrase that
yes i'm just saying i can't i can't from
what
i've read and i'm sure there's gaps uh
recall a time where it did not
explicitly backfire in some way
that's that's sort of not yeah we had us
we did a sword and we put in
you know stones on things backfired
incredibly that's like one of your
biggest
that's the sword didn't backfire we were
stabbed in the back and somebody took
the sword
well you used the sword to resurrect
knight a chris i didn't use it not
intentionally
well again backfire
and again best example of
all right that's why i am willing to
work
well professor alders is very
professional and capable
i i reckon that won't be too difficult
and alexander just
slams the rest of her drink uh
so it sounds like you're gonna maybe
spend a day working
on trying to teach professor aldridge
the elder sign stuff and
um they will make mimeographs they get
us to not they get like
a pool of stenographers to like record
all
of of you know like if you say
they have a day to get silvano's notes
then they get a hundred typists
and they're just like before they do
this before they do this i'm going to
ask the group
should i give them all of the notes or
is there any that we should not
what do you want everything just give
them what they need i mean look at the
way they i mean literally if rodgers
didn't have good intent
okay i just wanted to make sure and
i want to make it get a promise that i
will get the notes back when they're
done
uh there you you know you said you need
them back today so they are like
bringing in every typist they can find
to like perfect hurry up and and get
them done
um perfect so what you think is that um
because
of the way this is happening the the
teach is going to be a little disjointed
um
you know in you know it's it's the
classic sort of
when you make one clock everything is
fine-tuned and perfect when you make a
thousand clocks
you know some some corners get shaved
and so you know that it's
you get that sense joan as your kind of
um
uh talking through this and working
through things is that like
uh stanford and gavigan and that sort of
thing their approach to magic was like
as a craftsman
and this is a uniquely american like
as long as they have everything they
have all you know i'm gonna try to give
them all the nuances and if they need to
shave those
but at least they have them yeah that's
my that's the way i'm focused
uh professor aldridge will ask you if
you'd like to
be involved in the first test of
the
uh elder sign ritual
how involved would you like me
uh well i mean you you're the only
person here who has
performed this ritual it would be
wonderful if you could assist
perfect make me an
hard success all right so the last time
that's true now
aldridge will tell you that
theoretically
if we hook you up to gavigan as well the
drain will come through still will
will come through gavigan but
i want to stress the use of the word
theoretically yes
that's the problem isn't it well i
noticed that you were
very much able to use
yes although that ritual
does not require it does not have the
same cost as i understand
that this one does this is imbuing
the ritual says part of your soul but i
really think that's
existential metaphysical poppycock
energy it's energy sure um
and and you are imparting that energy
permanently
into the item
whereas the the repairing uh
ritual did not have that same power
because it didn't power the item it just
fixed it
okay all right
um all right i am willing to be hooked
up
to the battery
as well i have learned how to use
battery power
so yeah you have some experience with
that
uh okay so does anybody else want to
watch this ritual
can we watch from that behind the glass
behind the two-way glass if we can watch
from a point where we don't run the risk
of being drained i'm down for it
otherwise no thank you
there is the two-way glass there so
you will
um yeah all right so um
joan you and aldridge go in and um
weird needles stuck in your arm
uh and it feels when the needle gets
stuck in your arm it feels
a little bit like the feeling you got
with the staves good
okay and uh
it is yeah it feels a little bit like
that and
um you start the ritual now you recall
that the ritual is actually quite long
so they have on the table there is
um a a metal a piece of metal
with an elder sign uh
that has been welded into it
and they uh
that is the focus and so you and
professor aldridge start chanting
oh eight yes okay so wow that's
ending yeah that's yeah that's
outstanding that's
the i keep calling it urgent
i think outstanding was 40 standing yes
uh the only one i did remember for
sure is amazing was 50.
um so you and dr aldridge are
chanting and it seems like
uh the battery thing is is working
i'm feeling it come in to me from that
from the battery basically well
what you aren't feeling is anything
coming out of you
all right in that la the la and when you
have performed it before
there was a definite feeling of part
of you was being imparted into that
right the gaving in body is tense
once again you got a great roll on
the power rolls so
um i think gosh i don't remember it it
was several hours so you guys chant for
several hours
in front of you is a a metal elder sign
that it's not glowing or anything
like that
um but then the other ones only well no
it is
there's a there's a little light okay
good because we need a little light to
know right
but well you know you know that location
uh silvano was very hung up on
you know places of power and putting
them
in you know where you made the elder
sign was super important
right and and then i will i i'll also
imbue that with her
just to tell her that you know that's
why it's not glowing furiously and
things like that
sure yeah she's infused and she's
you know professor aldridge is uh
very excited that that worked and thanks
you profusely
and she feels okay no problems
i feel wonderful i can't wait to do this
again
it can be draining so we just need to be
careful
we got a battery i wonder how long that
battery is going to last
[Music]
very quietly from it from the room in
the two with the two-way
uh glass yeah i'm actually getting kind
of excited
i don't care how long it lasts i'm just
concerned that gavigan's now back in
jones head i mean we
got rid of one problem
to now have another one pointed donnell
and potentially a third
so in the in the two-way glass you guys
are all
um you have some questions about what
the liquid coming out of gavigan is
because
do we really though what have we seen
i don't think we've seen anything but
it's green that spider thing the spider
thing with one eye
bled green i'm trying to remember what
you're talking about
yeah yeah it was in my room and it
killed joan
and then also was there something at
that sounds right yeah i think there
might have been i don't remember what it
was but
that's enough to look it up i'm familiar
or any of this
that's what has always come out of of
this corpse
sure
is the doctor with us yeah yeah he's in
there as well
dr hollister maybe you should examine
these two after this ritual the sheep is
anything
unusual about them oh no i've
what's what's the fluid that goes from
you're not sure no i mean i then again
he's a zombie i mean i i i would
think that it's very bloodlike and my
suspicion
would be that it is due to
due to his magical activities that that
might be a part of the factor as to why
his body's changed is that
green substance mixing with jones blood
we've pulled we've got the things out of
our arms now and we're just talking
right yeah yeah you know
every absolutely every time that i have
heard that sentence it should be fine
usually it's not no i know it back every
single time that i have heard that
sentence it has been wrong
yeah i mean you did until you saw that
it was fine for a while
so what now so now joan is fine
according to that until she turns into
and i mean let's be honest she's never
[Laughter]
you know perfectly right how you know
perfectly well how right i am when i say
that
joan make me a
make me a cthulhu bethos roll oh here we
go
um i i don't i only one
do you have do you want to make it i
have one
yeah well but and i did not make it you
went in
77 so
[Laughter]
you could try again because you know the
most important thing is to have cthulhu
mythos
i've got 11. you could catch up
that's right yours is higher than mine i
was just thinking that i had the highest
in the park
i have one because of some of the stuff
that we've been doing but that's
right joan also you can make me a
psychology role
okay
i didn't make it yeah i rolled a 17
and i have 10.
so it's been seven luck
it's tempting it is why why no
because the person who spent luck like
it was water
it'd be good to know what's going on uh
so don't so what i will give you you're
gonna do it
oh did you spend the seven luck i'm
gonna do it is that for
psychology yeah that's for the
psychology i thought we were talking
about cthulhu mythos still
okay so you spend seven luck
um so with psychology
um professor aldridge keeps that
iv in her arm like one beat longer than
okay and i'll ask her it's like it's
like we're done why
take it out let's go oh thank you i i it
feels so natural that i sometimes forget
that it's in
and she'll take it out you forget that
from the other room
oh yeah so you you forget that you have
an iv in your arm
how do you do this that often i mean
we need to test this and you saw the
the other texts that we have are just
not as
arcanely prepared as i am
do i with with that my my role
do i sense that she's getting
anything else pulled out of her from
that i'm like uh
is she less sane no than she could be
okay
although who the hell are you to judge
how sane someone is
true true but i thought that's my
job that's true i thought i'd ask
which i kind of actually as i'm watching
this happen
i'm taking some notes just turned to
alexandra's like
the professor may have to go soon
i mean i guess she isn't that different
here
well we still keep talking i keep
talking to her and everything like that
just uh
we're talking about all how she what
other kinds of things she's done so i'm
gonna try to get all the info i can out
of her
well there's you know she'll let you
know that there's not a lot
they have in the way of arcane knowledge
they have one tome
and i want to see that it's fairly
limited
um and they
have some some pretty exhaustive notes
on the portal stuff that dr kafur
and yusef were working on
oh then we can exchange i gave you some
notes and maybe i can get access to the
tome and i saw the guy reading it and he
yeah
he doesn't do anything that tome is not
leaving this building oh no no no
but i i can take no notes right but
you are leaving this building as i
understand it
i don't follow the tome will not be
leaving the building but i get to see it
what can you you're leaving tomorrow
or possibly today to get to the zeppelin
it's months of of research required
i i understand but it i
i just wanted to get an idea of what
kind of stuff you guys have when i come
back
she's almost insulted at like your
cavalier like attitude towards research
and but she's like
you dabble i got you through this
and your your people that you're
now that we have the notes that we
require
we will be get we will begin producing
these elder signs
on a scale that you can't even imagine
well thank you for your help you've been
most useful it was
uh it was very it was very helpful to
have someone who had done the ritual
before here
well i appreciate that but any why
we have some we're we're we're
researchers we're sharing information
we have some concerns that the impact
that extended arcane
arcane magics
we are working on
some methods to train our minds
and to better prepare
new recruits to handle
the rigors of this knowledge
you don't think i'm rigorous enough for
the knowledge okay
we need to go get her out of there
before no i'm just going to sit back and
enjoy this
somehow like all of a sudden the crowbar
is in joan's hand
professor lam is is something wrong
the fact that you want to take
everything from me
and not return the favor and
imply that i'm not worthy or that i
don't know what i'm
enough doing enough i don't have enough
training for this
yeah there's something wrong i think our
concern
is that you consider national security a
favor
you're not helping me you're helping the
united states of america
and if i had more information i could
you'll pardon me if we are uh
we're wary of trusting the group that
gave
they stole a mind they stole a body
they stole several bodies it's all on
them
at what point when it happens to you
repeatedly
were you not aware of mr khan khan's
condition
we knew that that that that he had
something on his neck
but what it was and what it could do was
not apparent and we also
sent him here to get it excised and
fixed
and guess what
he came here to have it excise and fit
fixed
mr concannon was clear to us that he
realized that this mark was going to
make him do
do i hear that or not no all right well
that's that's aldrich for you she makes
very definitive statements when she
it seems that you don't trust me
don't know if i should trust you and i'm
done
and i i grab all my stuff and i walk out
of the room
all right aldridge stays in there and
those of you in the in the the room
with the glass
um you who you see she turns around and
there's almost like
a caress of get of the gavigan corpse
as she turns around and leaves yeah we
i suppose i shouldn't be giving her
those notes from that youssef fellow
no no when we said don't share we meant
don't share
right right yeah and this and and this
is the point where we're
where i say we don't share anymore if we
don't absolutely have to
and i and and i shoot hollister look
yeah we both are like
i'm like look at him and go go ahead
disagree with me
oh man when i get back to you guys i
want to say you guys told me i should
share with
you everything
now after observing that i think i have
some recommendations for rogers
regarding the professor
there are things that i know that
indicate that she is
someone who is seduced by this kind of
yeah i'm going to speak to rogers people
who have
power don't want to share it
and they want more yeah
and as i say that i look at joan and
they have no regard for other human
beings dr hollister
i you know you say that we mess things
up constantly it's because we have a
conscious
it's because we're not going to do
things like leave people in a prison in
the basement um
that's why we mess things up donald
backs away from this conversation
slightly
yeah well and i did not tell them how
exactly it went down down there and it's
going to stay our little
secret well you know and then i'll
probably start ranting about power with
a conscience and
and and and you know how people always
try to take power from you and they
don't believe you and
i'm going to have a i'm going to have a
little rant i'm going to have a little
rant because i
am really upset at her that's exactly
how it felt that's her power
exactly how it felt
um and this time it's another woman
doing it to you
not not a pack of men but she's a
psychologist
that's true now so hollister do you
wanted to
slow turn on that remark but
no i i only say that because i have seen
how often joan reacts very poorly to men
telling her what to do
i'm observing that that it's interesting
that it was a woman this time that's got
to cut deeper
in some ways because it's like you know
there there's
there's this idea of you know women
stick together
uh so you wanna just be clear are
you is the are you taking the zeppelin
are you do you need the military boat
which
which route are you going let's see
i was leaning towards zeppelin what is
everyone else
let's go i don't want to be on a
military boat
as long as we can get lots of guns and
flamethrowers and grenades when we get
to italy well and that and that
is my concern we're not going to be able
to bring things on the zeppelin
especially not through germany
um if we go on the military vessel it'll
be
a bit slower so donald knows that there
are military you know there's at least
to be honest this happened just sounds
and if we can get stuff when we get
there
i mean you like i said donald knows that
there's at least one military base in
cairo that
has been helpful to him in the past and
uh he's got a buddy there now so
he does kind of owe you a favor since
you were you guys were so insistent on
making sure that he stayed alive through
that
well he owes flint a favor but yeah well
we'll take it
get transferred all right so um
hollister you wanted to like uh
you wanted to leave a note or something
for well i might go directly to
rogers
and go over her
uh the professor's
apparent gavigan addiction
because like thinking back to when the
person was getting the
the the language wrong on the the the
first ritual
we saw i'm i'm questioning
if that was actually genuine or if that
was an excuse
to hook up to the body and i'm
i'm stating that uh
that there there could be side effects
that we're not aware of
and given the the great dane
society's track record
of of magic backfiring that there's a
potential for that here
and to take measures to limit her
i you know i i want to try and
ameliorate this through using
as many of the texts as possible dr
aldridge
is pretty adamant that the texts are not
up to the task but with your you know
with your field i'm going to be
i i'll i'll try and be more hands-on and
make sure that we are
focusing more on spreading the
uh the wealth so to speak thank you for
thank you for bringing this to my
it's there's i've got so many i'm i'm
juggling so many plates right now
is that is this time for a therapy
session should i should i help him work
through something
you know what you can make a
psychotherapy role and
i god if you fumble that would be
awesome
you drive rogers no i'm wondering if i
actually want to spend one luck or ask
for inspiration
just do the luck what's the name of
rogers a saint rogers is good for all of
us
what's the target number what's the
target number for that for their role
what 60 and i rolled a 61.
how how much luck do you have that's the
real question buck is precious we don't
talk about how much it is
yes we do how much do you have
and get to the cool number yes yes
okay all right then we're left buddies
all right so you make it and you
definitely have
uh calmed rogers some
and you feel like you know he
he sort of um
as you're kind of calming him and that
sort of thing he he will let you know
that you know
deep down he doubts his
you know he doubts the the the human
cost of everything he's doing
and he has to put on this
you know he he he he really it drains
him to put on this
uncaring facade as he is
you know clearly sending especially with
uh kefur and and the other boy
that you still feel that way
shows that deep down you are still a
good person
i i guess you're if you don't mind we'd
like you to continue with your
uh even though we no longer need to
observe mr concannon the other parts of
your mission still
uh are of great interest to us i'd
really like to run some more tests on
him if i get the chance
though all right uh
well you're gonna have a week on a
zeppelin
no the the equipment would be too
dangerous there
perhaps on the boat all right there we
go
uh well godspeed dr hollister
godspeed so yeah you
will you know you'll um
get some meager clothes together and you
you head up to new jersey for some
reason many of you don't want to go to
new york
and so you kind of skirt new york
like a part of alexandria wants to go
and retrieve some of her stuff
because she has her flat there but also
there's a yeah there's a very anxious
moment for some of you as you wait for
the the train switch in grand central
yep anytime i see a cop i'm like
[Laughter]
oh i'm i'm happy to go back to jersey
and yeah you you make it to new jersey
there is
um a just a huge open field and before
you
is uh the zeppelin
oh we'll call it we'll call it the
i'm trying to think of a suitably a
duchess
called the duchess yes that is
outstanding
uh and it is a
massive thing you actually climb up
a tower and then there is a gang
plank
attached to it it is tied it is moored
to this tower
and you climb up a a surprisingly
flimsy tower
um and walk across the gangplank
and you are inside everyone has
there are state rooms so you have very
nice
uh about the size of of a cruise ship
room
you know you have a very nice room um
the the main
open area is actually a dining area
and then also a dance floor and
there's a
kitchen down below and all the crews
stay down below
um and all the lavatories are down below
because the lavatories tend to release
out into the ocean so the lavatories are
on the
ground floor as well as nature intended
uh but it is um
it is you know a beautiful inside it's
all sort of art deco
uh beautiful design it's well lit
uh it's it's a little loud when the
engines start up
but you pull out and you start to
head
towards the uh
you know heading across the atlantic and
uh
at dinner there is uh
um dinner is a a full dress affair
uh let's see did anybody try to sneak
weapons on board
i mean i mean
my ornamental sword but that's just
purely for a
show yeah
they will allow the sword in the hold
they won't allow on your person
okay yeah i
you're you're trying to sneak aboard a
pistol yeah so
uh both of you make me a stealth roll
and i'll give you both an advantage die
because you habitually sneak things
uh on trees i'm gonna bring like
my clip because i don't know if i'll be
able to find another one of those but i
left the revolver
all right yeah they don't really know
what the clip is so they're 18 hard
success
a smaller than you're comfortable with
brace of knives
which means i only have like five
instead of nine
obar is no problem they they don't you
so the first night uh
you're you're all a little underdressed
for dinner you uh
it's been it's been several uh
actually dr hollister you might have
uh you have appropriate formal wear
but everybody else is
a little underdressed it's been
several
we lost our luggages since you had any
sort of formal wear
um and so you are
you are shunted to a table on the
outside
uh in the uh
in the later seating of dinner but um
it is a a lovely meal uh
and and afterwards the tables are very
quickly cleared away
and there's a dance floor and there's
uh
um there's a small band that is
playing
um the band is playing a little louder
than usual because the engines are
actually quite loud
um and they are quite close to uh
uh the cabins and
everybody make me a luck roll
i will laugh so hard if that is the case
all right okay all right come on emma
i have one hope see how those
can can we crit on a locker room no
yay that's 15. nice all right
so the first night
you're you're all pretty much left to
your own devices unless you want to
go up and talk to people there are
a number of german conversations going
on there's
at least one gentleman in some sort of
german military uniform
uh and there are a number of uh
very well-dressed people uh
all over there's a lot of money on this
zeppelin
we don't see what's his name the scam
artist with the uh
no we don't say we know okay no that
that that
you you yeah you wouldn't recognize uh
him if you saw him
i'm going to bed you know what i need a
drink and i'm going to bed and i'm
locking the door and
please let nothing bad happen yeah i i i
imagine at least the first night are
do do i know any of these dances or this
is or is this a little too new
no yeah you you recognize a couple yeah
yeah i'll i'll i'll pull donald on to
the floor i'm like come on
indulge me let's get let's let's listen
dr hollister dance
uh not well but i i
okay let's see here
yeah above the ocean
so joan yeah you're dancing with dr
hollister
and one of the germans in the military
uniform
he's got like a chest full of medals he
um
he's dancing with a young lady and
he says to hollister would you mind if i
cut in
and he like motions to the young lady to
you
a little bit let's let's let's try all
right
um make me a dex roll professor

where things can go bad
all right make me did you you got
inspiration try it again
all right who me no i asked i needed
yeah nobody cares if you step on the
pretty girl's feet yeah
yes i am i am very dexterous
all right so thank you he rolled in 03
so you two
start to like do this
very intricate a waltzing dance
and he's impressed he's clearly
impressed that you know the steps
and you get the sense that he's like um
shivan knows this one
uh and so when the dance ends he takes
your hand and he kisses your hand and
then
uh i am count carl fondurian
it is a pleasure to meet you and he
is carl
von doyen would be the english version
but german is fun yes
and i tell him that i am dr john lamb
it is it is a rare and wonderful
pleasure to meet
a woman who dances such as you professor
especially
god do i know any german at all yeah it
doesn't have it on my thing but
all right um
he will i
trust that we will dance again
well if we happen to meet again i would
love to
then in my language alvida zen

the crowd
what's what's holly doing uh
holly is dancing with a a lovely young
lady who
uh is when when he when he says
he's a doctor she's like
oh i've never met a doctor before
oh god one of those oh i've lost him for
the night i'll go sit back down and
drink
actually he kind of looks like he'd
rather be anywhere else
okay that's that's what i needed i
needed a i needed a hint
at that i stopped and i'm like you must
have gone to the doctor at some point
have you never been sick my my parents
told me i was rich we don't go to the
doctor
well then they the doctor comes to you
yeah because i've never been sick before
though
i'm rich i don't get sick
i don't think that works i see them
talking
and i'm gonna come over because he looks
 and she walks off whoa
jersey girl huh yeah
[Laughter]
uh yeah and you guys will will continue
to dance
uh and yeah you danced the night away
and it's the next day
you are a quarter of the way of your
voyage
through across the atlantic
and there is a
uh a little bit of a commotion at
breakfast
and you see professor lam you see
uh the count count vanduian
uh is having a heated discussion with
um with the staff of of
the of the dirigible um
apparently in german but there's a lot
of spitting going on
um it's german he seems very angry about
something
and he finally storms off and slams the
door he's in a he's in
the suite and he slams the door um
do we see any of that yeah you all will
see him like
storm off and slam does anyone speak
german
all right the only you hear deeb
stall is the the word you he you know
you he
he he like he just goes and he storms
off into his
uh jonah is that the fellow that you
were dancing with last night
yes no he's a as a german count
yeah might want to find out what's going
on right yeah absolutely no
poor guy no no no you know what we don't
need to do
get into trouble on a moving vehicle
boat oh no original trouble whatever
you know gentlemen last night and i was
dancing with him
whatever his problems are are his
problems joan do you remember the last
time that we got involved with someone
else's problems on a moving vehicle
it i'll give you a hint it involved
fishman yep
oh or wait was that the time or what
about the time before when we were on a
boat and we ended up
what was that what were those little
weird things that were jumping all over
the place in the met in the six
yeah okay okay but that wasn't us to be
fair that was like yeah
i don't care what the other options are
the the title of next episode is what we
don't need to do is get in trouble on a
because that my friends that's called
foreshadowing
boy and nothing
like there's a counterpoint if this
fellow this this fellow is very rich
and powerful
we could use some fronts oh
but we also don't need these tell you
what i will commiserate with the uh
the the cooking staff people and go oh
man what's that that guy what did he do
there it is oh no english
i i speak some english how can i help
you ma'am oh just
i saw that guy yelling at you are you
okay
yes everything is fine ma'am what was
what was wrong what was his problem
that is not your concern madam oh well i
just was worried about you that's all
i'm playing up the jersey forum he's
playing up the intractable german for
you
i thought so i figured that
they're not so chatty you've got you
have away with people
surprisingly for important for a german
person
and i think at lunch time of day two
we're going to call it a call it an
evening
it is it is the the it is the
the apportioned time and i always end on
time
uh so here we i i mean i don't know why
i'm going to read these because there's
really only one choice for the titles
but uh
what we have for titles of we'll have
the element of surprise
we never do i don't know how sneaky you
can be
let's just assume the worst also a fine
title
uh i don't want to hand everything over
i just want to hand it over
uh what do what did they do now that's
not a moon that's a flesh star
this actually was before the before emma
made the magic quote this was the quote
it was like reading a train wreck
i enjoyed that magic works
we don't work well it's very blood like
when we said we don't share we meant
don't share
and i think the clear choice for episode
title
what we don't need to do is get in
i think that that is the title of next
episode oh
foreshadowing yep no
portion for five shadowing six shadowing
yeah
is get in trouble on a moving vehicle
it's clearly what we do
uh so thank you all so much for the bits
i think we're putting a
big chunk in yeah go eye there a nice
chunk of chunk of change there we go
that that
that that makes me think there might be
some nice giveaways coming up next
week
uh and speaking of next week monday it's
the finale
of d and d with rick and morty which
i'm given to understand the kids love
and one party but that's
part one oh man don't give aaron any
ideas
[Laughter]
tuesday they're back and they're really
about the same as ever the chaos agents
uh will be doing that thing they do
uh ignoring thomas really is is what
they do
uh and then we are back on saturday uh
for more
with the great dane society seth
congratulations
enjoy those dice yeah this will be
you know we're really saving on postage
we'll just you know we can it's a
nice short jump
uh and i think
oh there only the percentile dice have
been rolled although she pulled out a
d20 for some reason we're still not i
accidentally rolled a d20 i was feeling
festive
um and be sure to look out coming
soon
uh aaron and they put out
another one of
their aaron and herbs did another one
of their movie talks aaron and warren

title of that movie i think i just
messed up the name of that movie damn it
i
what what yeah i'm glad it's not just me
going
uh but that that's a joke they're
not gonna do that that was a terrible
movie
and i would be shocked if they talked
about it
i wouldn't really and another episode
of the untitled podcast just dropped
uh talking to my buddy ando from
hiber
and they are awesome so listen to that
and
i think with that goodbye internet oh
next week

doing all of this silliness
oh wow what next week will be one year
that we have been
uh doing all of this now
proviso there was a there was a break
through there
you know so our year was extended but
uh it has been a year of me saying
[Music]
