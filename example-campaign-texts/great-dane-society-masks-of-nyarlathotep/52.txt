so last time some things were were said
some
you know some some curses were
triggered
all that sort of thing so we started
off
you guys used the portal to you decided
to use the portal to go to dc
and and not do the
um not do the the ritual in cairo
um unfortunately carl stanford's curse
came into play and donald sent the
portal machine
and yousef and dr caffor uh
over to carl stanford and i i wanna
there was we talked about this a
little bit on the discord but i wanna
shout out
uh so when tom and i came up with the
idea i
i emailed tom and i'm like you're gonna
get cursed
but you know player agency is super
important to me and
so i wanted to work with tom to figure
out what it was and so
um what i said was you know at some
point you're going to do something
terrible
to the group but you decide what it is
and i
you know i was just waiting i sit and
wait and
last week's game a little chat message
pops up
and i can barely see the chat messages
so i i was only
sort of paying attention and
tom sends me a chat saying
hey should i get rid of the portal
machine
should that be my curse and i'm like
what a great idea
yes and so
a as if you're a gm and don't
if you're doing curses and stuff like
that let your players come up with
things
trust them to uh
do bad things to to to themselves
because
it make a they know their characters
better than you do
b it has real stakes for them
and it in it it it folds your players
back
into the story it's i
i it's something that i think is is
super important player agency
uh it's why you know people joke like
oh nobody's gonna die nobody ever dies
and to me like that's a a character
death
or a character departing the show that's
a that's a choice that's like a
conversation
with the character to decide if it's
dramatically appropriate in a campaign
in a one-shot
kill them all they're kindling but
so you know and and kudos to tom tom you
took that and you ran with it and that's
you know that's
as a gm that's what you hope for we're
also really good at screwing over the
story we're kind of
experts at that so it wasn't ever for us
to do but this time you did it on
purpose
yeah that was the thing right there
uh so yeah you it after some
shenanigans and you met you met
an old friend
at the at the dc headquarters
and you
professor aldridge was there working
with agent rogers she's apparently
one of their
uh one of their arcanists and um
you you got tickets on a very
exclusive
trip you got a blimp ticket so you are
currently
taking a zeppelin across the atlantic
ocean
uh you left on friday
and the next morning you were awoken as
always
um by your butler who comes in with a
very cheery guten morgen
and gets your breakfast orders so
that they're ready if you don't want to
have breakfast out in the dining room
um and then at breakfast there was
a little bit of a commotion as count
van doyen who
uh professor lam had met the night
before was yelling
at some of the staff and
uh unfortunately none of you speak
german so you don't know what he was on
about
uh and and the staff is far too um
politely circumspect to to
really say anything so you have
uh you know you you went through
there and it's now
lunchtime on it is saturday may 9th
and so you are on this blimp and
basically at once breakfast is done
and once once meals are done they clear
the tables and then they're card there
you know you can play cards you can do
whatever
there are there are about 25
passengers
on this blimp that's pretty small
um and you know before
before amy before the before amy starts
googling things
yes the first transatlantic
zeppelin ride was not until 1928
but also people don't ride flying snakes
so we'll call it even
and and also also everything where that
was true
the universe where that was true is the
one that emma yeah any
any historical facts that are wrong here
are emma's fault
actually we should blame the baroness
because she just gave 1500 bits to the
dark pharaoh to mess with everyone
oh man equates to ezra well the dark
pharaoh might have to show up this
episode then
our stacks are even now this saddens me
all right at lunch you loved me
well if after breakfast if it's okay i'd
like to uh
take some time to i figured now that
we're settled in
i can take some time and and speak with
donald and check up on how he's doing
and
how he's healing sure yeah
uh is this are you trying first aid
medicine
psychotherapy what is uh
psychotherapy under the guise of
medicine all right
i want to see what he's doing so make me
a psychoanalysis role
he's having breakfast everybody else i
assume who's that breakfast he's not by
himself
right yeah yeah so after breakfast you
guys repair to
one of the state rooms to have a lovely
discussion i lost that
dice never getting it back okay
uh hard success oh nice all right
so so donald you are actually
like very soothed by this conversation
and
you like you know you you feel like
um one of the things that comforts you
about this
is that you know dr hollister works
in this program that you have just
hamstrung and he's here kind of telling
you hey look it's okay
everything's you know like this this
sort of thing happens and that that
really kind of
assuages some of your guilt and you'll
actually get one sanity back
immediately if this is an ongoing
thing you'll actually get more sanity
back if you spend this time but
that's gonna take
oh i'm gonna just fell down uh
that's gonna be a more ongoing process
the joys of living in a house with a
so it sounds like if it's if it seems to
be helping and donald feels good about
this he trusts hollister
he can tell officer the truth okay like
anybody else so
he'll probably agree to make this a
regular
a daily occurrence so during our voyage
and to hash out some of these
issues that donald's been holding back
on nice all right
this is a perfect time to do it i mean
when we're all relaxing and no one's
causing any trouble well and
and and i was actually going to ask if i
if i could do the same and have
alexandria have chats with dr
hollister if his time isn't too occupied
with donald
trump oh my my cabin is always open all
right yeah
so that'll be the afternoon that'll be
your afternoon appointment
um at lunch everybody give me a spot
hidden roll oh
critical success wow damn success
just so you know i dropped the dice that
i typically use
that that crit fumble and i'm using a
different set right now oh man
keep these no i want to find my bad dice
no
no no no no no no no sit your butt down
we'll see my roles are like pre-baked
post-breaking that was the roll that was
the roll
you made it right away so
uh dr hollister you notice
um once again the count is
uh is sort of causing not quite a
commotion but he's going around
and and looking for things and and
everybody who makes the role notices
that with the count
dr hollister you in particular notice
that one
of the staff is kind of shadowing him
the whole time like
you know could be like keeping him out
of trouble
could be listening to everything he does
could be trying to kill him
you know could be anything i don't know
i'm trying to kill him i'm going to rule
that one
out just i want to wave at him and say
hi at the count
yeah he's my buddy all right
um they did strike it off pretty well
yeah all right so he
he will he'll come over and he'll he'll
to your table and he'll say
fine it is it is lovely to see you
again i hope that uh
this evening you will once again be on
the dance floor oh
that would be great you're gonna be
you're gonna be okay
yes yes i have just yes i'm just
working with the staff on a small
problem oh well if you want to talk
to thank you that is very kind you're
welcome
um make a joan make a sh
i just made it all right um
he's got like bags under his eyes
he's looking a little tired yeah yeah
um maybe you know he's sweating a little
you know oh man it's like you don't look
good
you don't look good count i'm worried
ah no i i'm not sleeping well on the
blimp
um you could say this yes
but please excuse me and he goes back
to like he's kind of
uh now that you're now you know now
you're all sort of watching him
he's kind of not very subtly like
looking at
every table kind of like casing who's
there
he's looking at the p so he's not
looking for something he's looking at
the people
ah people yes he's looking at the people
is sort of trying to like get him to
stop doing it
dr hollister do you have any muscle
relaxant
moral accents on you relaxants he's
already had a couple
yeah i don't i don't recommend
uh taking morphine just to relax though
no that man is trouble with the
squirrely eyes looking around he's
nothing but trouble on this blimp we
need to sleep
put him to bed let him sit in his room
no trouble
uh sometimes sleeping poses yeah yeah
some sleep aid some sleep aid
sounds like us creating an incident no
it's not
no no no no no no i'm not i just goes to
bed
no no but we could offer if we had
something i'd offer it to him
this has been a delightful lunch i'm
going to head back to my cabin
uh actually i wanted to i want to chat
with you dr hollister if i could
of course yeah all right make a
psychoanalysis role again
i've used up all the good ones i'm sorry
no don't say that
you know what's really fun to fumble on
a psychoanalysis oh
god no it's a hard success yes yes
all right my creaky sanity thanks you
uh so yeah tiana similarly uh
you know it's not you get one sanity
back
um and and it's you know this is more
sort of establishing the relationship
and the rapport that will allow
the conversations that will get you to
the point of getting some
some serious things going back but um
you're you're very impressed with
hollister's sort of almost detached
professionalism
and yeah it's it's a good you know
good setup
it's a good start yes yes
uh so unless something else is going on
you know we'll
oh what's up family 500 bits from
vindication so
before we move on to other other weird
and strange things that are going to
happen because nobody wants to drug
the count with me where are my bad dice
where do they oh when we're doing
psychoanalysis stuff don't fumble on us
well they've already been done so now
it's time to switch over oh no no no no
no no you got what you got because
how how many days are we going are we
going to cover today we need
and and we'll be doing psycho stuff just
you're good you're good you got what you
got you're good
all right play some cards
so yeah yeah you know there's there's an
afternoon of cards and it's it's very
calm and soothing
um it's actually a lovely way to travel
when you're not bursting into flames
uh and it is it is very soothing
there's
um there's pretty much constant light
alcohol wine champagne brandy

commotion

entire tray of food just crash

apologetic

but the three
emma alexandra and joan make spot hidden
roles
yep just regular all right uh
if you made the role he seems
um he seems
uh he looks a lot worse than yesterday
than when it alright and the last time
this happened
he seems he seems paler and he's
definitely sweating and that was not the
case
uh the previous time this happened uh
and he once again
is talking with the things and he yells
deep stall
and then he like walks a little creakily
back to his room
okay i'm gonna go to his right to his
room and knock on the door
what does that mean that deep stuff

i i would like to see you tonight can
you
make it out you're going to be okay we

do you want to talk to our doctor i'm
fine
thank you all right all right get some
rest
yes and he goes back in his room
he's not telling me anything i'm gonna
play cards with these guys later and i'm
gonna smoke that yeah yeah
make me an intelligence role emma let's
see if you remember all the cards
that's awesome come on oh no 83.
you remember some of them you definitely
you do better than usual
um emma's on a real luck streak guys at
lun at lunchtime it's
it's crazy before lunch i'd like to
uh
talk to donal again yeah all right so
make a psychoanalysis role
oh but i make it all right so
regular success or what yeah regular
success all right
so donald you get one point of sanity
back you don't
um it it's this is the start of a
conversation the critical success
earlier it felt totally different but
that now no longer exists so um
you know this is the start of a
conversation you're starting to build
that rapport where you feel comfortable
talking about it and those guys are
talking to each other
i want to talk i'm going to say anything
i'm going to say this do you guys have
everything you guys you guys aren't
there hollister and donald you guys are
not there
i'm talking to the you guys absolutely
everything is the same it's it's may 9th
again
and i remember everything that happened
may 9th
okay it's not just me i thought
something was wrong but i thought i'd
before i went and talked to dr hollister
they don't seem to he didn't seem to
understand that this was
the same he's also a doctor he's not
supposed to be like
you know donald didn't donald you know
just
made his order again and didn't say
anything either
well he's just boring i mean hey now
he's not boring
well okay let's let's keep watching and
seeing if it comes the same way if
there's any way we can
make it well it's a little bit different
i went to the the um
i went to the couch door this time
i wonder i wonder what's going on i
think we should watch him
the account you think he has something
to do with us
there's only 20 people on this boat
unless it's unless it's our damn bellman
no he looked he looked worse than
yesterday you know
yes yes he was he was even more drawn he
was even more drippy
he just he looked in his eyes or even
more and this is in the morning this is
before the afternoon stuff
yeah so let's keep an eye out and yeah
so the last time
this day happened he in the morning
did not have any sign
of any sort of illness right when you
saw him yeah it was it was at lunch that
he was starting to look
haggard okay
so do we do we tell the guys do we tell
them
what's going on no we just break into
the count room while they're eating
lunch
okay well he said he he had something uh
emma in an intelligence role okay hang
on a second though before i
before i fail that ezra gets 500 bits
from
you can guarantee that the jd matthews
band will be in the battle of the bards
yeah and 1500 because i dropped these
yeah i'm gonna drop these for sure so
god why do i have to make more
intelligence rolls can somebody else do
that no
76 that's not right yeah everything's
fine from
what you're saying happened exactly that
way
i bet you there's something in his room
that's making him crazy
that's making today all over again he
said there was
something that
he didn't want to talk to me about he
said there was something going on there
was a
something and so maybe he lost
something well he's probably got some
artifact maybe but what could he have
lost
that would make the day repeat and i
mean yesterday at least
he was looking at the people when he was
walking around at lunch
do you remember that yeah yeah i'm just
trying to think
he will be again today at lunch but
he'll look he still looks pale
and a little a you know maybe a
little febrile
okay so i guess the real question is
yeah we'll we'll we'll break into his
room at lunch we can do that maybe maybe
i can get him to sit with me at lunch
maybe while you guys do that
maybe but if the day repeats again
we have to tell the guys yes agreed
maybe maybe they'll remember sure j
matthews gave
ezra 500 more i don't know why for the
jd matthews band obviously
yeah because his blood run
runs cold oh man the jay matthews band
are all diva
are all devas because their angel is a
centerfold oh yes
that's just an example of these horrible
things
i am so excited for tuesday i can't wait
i can't wait i got to make up some more
too i got to make up some more he
so originally it's the dark vision song
contest i wanted to call it the
infravision song contest
but that was too nerdy for a first
edition like improvision doesn't exist
anymore
no all right so at lunch
uh wow
just gifted subscriptions to five
subscriptions that is awesome
uh ldl you know maybe i'll i'll
work in an elder bars joke somewhere in
there um
outstanding so at lunch the count
is once again out he's a little wobbly
um he definitely looks worse than the
last time this day happened
um but he is still like he's focusing on
the people he's like looking
at the at the people so
uh when he gets to our table uh-huh i'm
gonna say
it is so nice to see you again it's nice
to see you except you don't look good
come sit with us come have something to
eat come on please
please don't don't hurt yourself i uh
i'm looking for someone you're looking
for someone there's only like 25 of us
that is to be ascertained you need any
help
i respectfully i do not think that you
couldn't help
with this situation but thank you very
much i'm good at finding things being
you know an archaeologist and
digging things up i'm really good at
helping find things
yes yes i am
i'm aware of your your skills in this
regard
um but
this is no you you would not
understand all right
please well oh no problem but you know
if you need anything
from myself i could have you talk to
our doctor
anything that you need just please let
us know
let us know all right once he's leaving
that same staff person is like shadowing
him
and he like he like turns around and he
says he starts talking to that guy in in
very clipped speedy german
that guy happened last time yeah
does he talk to the the staff person
oh keep the count talks to the staff
person guys again there's a there's a
there's a there's a a member of the wait
staff who's kind of shadowing him the
whole time
yeah and the count like wheels on that
guy
and starts to is it close enough to
here
sure do you want to make a german roll
yeah sure i'm german
with the yeah but it's really low and
i'm using these dice
yeah i didn't make it yeah you are the
only
player i've ever met who's gleeful to
miss roles
missing rules makes them interesting and
critting roles like like
critically fumbling roles makes them
very interesting
nice so yeah you um
you know after lunch you play cards
again emma has a real run of luck
it's almost like she knows what's coming
didn't we break into his room
oh yeah all right who is breaking into
the other two have no idea what we're
doing so joan is playing cards with
donald and dr hall
actually yeah
so alexandra you you don't
have another session so you don't have a
chance to get more sanity back with dr
downs
um and so yeah you two can go
down the hall and his
his room is off of the main central
foyer where all the meals and the the
recreation happen
um and so yeah you can you get to his
door
i'm i want to like listen at the door to
see if i can
hear him inside
uh 71 just made it wow
um yeah my listen's real good so
uh you hear snoring
damn it someone he's
i missed silvano we would have had ether
[Laughter]
the ether that we never used how
unfortunate
you didn't have ether until the
you guys really the headdress was the
best thing that ever happened to you
guys
then it was the worst yeah
so do we want to try to go let me see
snoring
i just want to see if he's like sleeping
in bed or like
hanging upside down that's all i want to
know
okay i'm gonna
very gently and very carefully try the
try the door to see if it's locked
just like turn it a little bit the door
is locked what's your
what's your locksmith 10.
all right so like i know i want
donald to do this but i would have to
explain why that
is going to take too long donald
could get in this door no problem like
these are not high security locks but it
is locked
um would i still be able to
pick it you can try yes thanks
um i'll like glance around like emma can
keep an eye out and i'll pull out a
a hairpin and start like and you tim two
hairpins and start like trying to work
it
and you can make the locksmith yeah in
fact spot shouldn't
that might be where is that ooh so it's
a hard success
very close to a critical success right
so with a hard success
um down the hall so
there's the the front of the of the of
the of the the place
with the main foyer and the cheap rooms
that are sort of the noisiest area
and then as you go back farther away
from the engines and stuff there are
nicer rooms and so
you've come down this hallway almost to
the end and it and there
is there's a crew only area like the
kitchen and everything
through there and you would swear that
you saw um
almost like you know the ripple in the
air that happens with smoke
how it like distorts things almost like
that heat ripple kind of thing you would
swear that you saw that for
down the kitchen just a hallway is is
the kitchen there
yes i don't know
what i like alexandra i'm like yellow
canary let's go
did you yellow yellow canary is that our
is that our word cool
yeah did you make the lock pick roll no
okay
yeah this this is beyond your you know
if you had like if you had plenty of
time
and weren't like kind of stressed you
know you'd think you'd
probably could get in but in this
you need a professional donald donald
would be able to pick this
should i grab him and ask him to do it
no i think something might be on fire
well you'd be the one to know and i'll
you're the expert i know knives you know
fire i don't question this
so you head back to the card game uh
nothing is on fire
you don't hear anybody screaming or
running or anything like that
so when we get to the air area where the
um the weird
ripple yeah so the weird ripples behind
you
like okay so that's the way i want to go
oh you want to go towards the ripple
yes so that's that's actually back
towards the back of the
zeppelin okay okay so you'll
you'll very quickly get to the double
doors that are
um into the kitchen both of you make me
i hate that sentence just made it
same exactly even it was way too close
okay oh so
you are both of you very briefly at the
exact same moment
have a weird feeling like you're being
watched
and you both feel like
um it feels very similar to that
experience you had with the hand of
glory
wow which one was that one that was the
invisible guy
it's been so so we feel like someone
invisible might be watching us
of the kitchen there's like swinging
doors so i swing straight through
and i'm like excuse me could i have a
glass of milk please
uh yeah so as soon there is a porter
there almost immediately and he's like
of course of course
um i will bring it out to you actually
could i just have it right here right
now please
of course and and um
he is trying very hard not to smile
because oh man throwback
uh he'll bring yeah he brings you
a glass of milk no problem and um
the kitchen is utterly normal there
doesn't seem to be any
uh any difference and you don't notice
any nobody's running around nothing's on
fire
i go back out the other i go back out
the door and start doing like
start spritzing milk around well and and
also
i i would i would ask because i sneak
around in dark areas and corners a lot
is there somewhere that
me looking at this as as if i were to
use this area as somewhere to like hide
and
like and be out of sight and be out of
the way is there a corner that i
that i would aim at make me an
intelligence role
sure
so yeah you think you know corners that
sort of thing
but then did you get a regular
success what'd you get regular
success okay yeah so yeah you
you check all of the the areas that you
think would be good for stealth and
you're like
you know emma's putting some milk there
you don't see anything
okay
all right so once once we've covered the
area and we're out of milk
i'm gonna i'm gonna look over at her in
i'm gonna look at her and say i think
now is when we bring the guys in
and let's let's go play some cards
okay i'ma let you explain this to them
well
we've already had to explain a universe
ending we might as well
well not to not to hollister actually
thinking about it no in fact i'm just
wondering should we make hollister go
somewhere
no i'm just afraid that he's gonna
commit me
i mean i i i talk about that should be
an episode
yes i'm afraid he's going to commit i
mean i
i think talking to him yesterday with
psychotherapy stuff
and yeah but you don't ask for a glass
of milk and spritz it all over the place
you're not like
this person needs to be put like it just
yeah the things that come out of my
mouth
are not normal and i cannot be trusted
to speak
in front of medical professionals
just lay it right there that entire
i think that's emma's mission statement
okay well
he's he's less likely he's less likely i
think to want to commit me at this point
so i'll do the explaining
thank you all right so yeah they are
they are playing cards and you guys come
back
and i and i plot and plop down prop my
my
my elbows on the table and say we have a
situation
what's the situation and what happened
well i'll i'll get to that in a moment
um i have to get across the ocean
joey has to be like jones like what okay
right um
there is no way to say this in a way
that doesn't sound slightly insane
but joan and
emma and i and you two as well but
i don't think you remember it we are
what what what do you mean by that i
don't understand what do you mean what
do you mean i know that you don't have a
full house so stop telling everybody
that you do right now
and you're she yeah it's it's right you
do not she just called your cards
like she will she will describe your
cards that's actually impossible
but no it's i i know it feels impossible
but you're murdering
me there's something no no no no we
experienced this before guys
the second day on the blimp so we were
here yesterday
no donal i mean we we saw
uh the count going around from person to
person
looking for things and tonight tonight
at dinner there's
one one of the servers is going to drop
an enormous tray of food
um all right but why the three of you
what does that mean i don't know i have
no idea why
no but i'm just saying you know why why
did you because it happened
it happened i was captured by that that
 he put a mark on my neck
did something happen to three of you
don't have entire knowledge
don't know but here's the thing but
here's the kicker
the the count is looking for someone you
heard him say that at
lunch we think
that there is someone who is using other
what i understand when i put the like
glass of milk down i'm like yeah
and i just look at it with this fun
little smile inside somewhere
jackson elias is smiling
oh no it's worse than we thought
what what's that's fine that's fine all
right so the three of you um
have you experienced this thing many
times what's what's the situation
once so far all right and how do we know
it's going to happen
again don't we don't i'm
hoping it doesn't i would prefer to just
i have a bad feeling though because
the count is the count is keep saying
there's a situation that he's got to
deal with and he's looking for someone
and he won't let me help
even though i keep telling him you know
i'm good at look finding things
emma emma and i went and went to his
room um
it's locked i couldn't get in i might i
might have you to
have a look at it donal if you wouldn't
mind
i was anyway um
but there's someone in there and they're
snoring i don't
which is interesting to me because the
count looks like he hasn't slept in
three months
all right maybe perhaps
if if he happens to see us it could be
that joan wanted to come visit him
that works okay
right this should be a better use of my
time anyway
thank you donna it's been a bad morning
all right sometimes
some somehow it's worse when there's
someone who remembers what the cards are
stares at joan
i nudge alexander i was like they're
they're not going alone let's go watch
the hallway but i do have a question so
up until now you've done
everything exactly the same as you did
before no we didn't do everything
exactly the same i mean
yesterday our time yes our r yesterday
we didn't go and look at the room we
didn't go into the kitchen we didn't see
a
wavy hazy thing like emma saw but
everything else around us has been the
same or very close
anyone else on this blimp not acting the
same
that's a good question so i will
point out the count
is in worse shape and he snapped at the
at the staffer who was following him so
he is clearly experiencing something
similar
staffers either sign or a difference as
far as i can
i i i would like to try and remember if
there's anyone who stands out as having
been different that i've seen
not yet but you're gonna start watching
for that now yeah
as far as i can tell no but i'll keep an
eye out
yeah all right we'll we'll we'll go
we'll watch the halls
as well and make sure that all right so
four of you
are standing in the hallway not at all
conspicuous
i mean i'm i'm i'm casually down down a
little ways
yeah we're at the end of the hallway
kind of watching the end of the hallway
is the kitchen
yeah am i at the door with you donald
just in case i'll let you in first
so you're the one visiting him hollister
are you uh
are you coming along on this shananna
these shenanigans
i'm actually very skeptical of this but
i'm not going to make that
known of course i think therapy
the psychotherapy sessions are going to
take a turn yeah well i mean the
the thing there's some stuff i'm not
going to bring it up because i just want
to watch them
but like some of what they're describing
doesn't add up in my head
yeah sure and and and if he ever brings
it up we'll we'll have that conversation
but and and i'm thinking about something
else
too but that'll be later okay so
uh so donald go ahead and make a
locksmith roll
all right well it takes a little longer
than usual i guess he's distracted he
failed the role
all right everybody who is on this
caper
success hard success
yep all right that was enough successes
so nobody comes down so yeah it takes
you a little bit longer
uh all right
um and the door opens and um
it is you know like all of these it's a
slightly larger than most of your rooms
it's a little nicer but the rooms are
not large by any it's like a cruise ship
basically you know so
um and tossing and turning
in the bed is the count um
he he is this room
has been like torn apart
not like let me rephrase that someone
has gone through this room with a
fine-tooth comb and not in like a clean
way
like everything's been thrown out of
drawers
but while breaking into this man's room
what we're looking in on him we're
looking in on him why
because he's he he's obviously not well
come on i roll my eyes
is is he saying this to joan and donald
is he up there with them yeah yeah he's
like
like so they opened the door and they're
being and you guys are like we're
looking out and hollister just walks up
behind them
like why are you doing this
[Laughter]
um the the the the count does not
seem to react
to the level of noise that you're
making he's still tossing and turning
yeah
it's not worth it to go in there it
looks like somebody's already trashed
his room
he's probably trashed himself lost
something or something's been smelled in
front of him
you're probably looking for a thief on
board yeah
all right let's tell the others uh
everybody make me a the three of you
make me listen roles the three of you at
the door make me listen to this
i'm looking for a hard success not
regular
regular all right everything's fine
he is mumbling to himself
oh in germany i'll speak german yeah
yeah
i can't get it people that spoke german
all around
well well if i can't speak it can i at
least write it down and try and work on
it later
uh yeah you could like you wrote down
the word
you know you can write down any of the
words and you can get the sounds right
but
um you can't hear any of what he's
saying he's like mumbling under his
breath
like i have to walk up to him and listen
but you're gonna go
in you go into the room i got my notepad
i go i creep in
okay all right i'm i'm i'm not gonna be
here when he gets up because i don't
want him to think i'm
doing something all right so joan is
leaving donald what are you doing i'm
gonna watch the doctor make sure he's
okay i'll stay at the door but i'll
watch
alexander and emma you have that feeling
again that
some invisible thing is watching this
entire thing
okay i'm gonna listen as hard as i can
to see if i can hear
clothes moving against each other or a
board creaking or something to tell me
where this person is
you okay you can make a listen roll
dr hollister you can also make a
uh a listen roll
bot nine oh that is better than a
critical
a 90. all right um
so the only thing you hear him say
hollister
um is he he mumbles a lot of stuff in
german you're not sure about and then he
says
sounds much like i could make a german
roll i could
you write that down you you notice um
alexandra you hear um
so you hear for the first time in a
couple
days you hear the like background hum
of the ship of the of the of the
zeppelin that you
you kind of tuned out on that frequency
um
and but that's all you hear i'm just
like
yeah i like have my eyes closed and
listening turning my head side to side
like
using using those opera trained ears to
pick out noises
i'm just like well i didn't want to hear
that again
uh so are you leaving the room are you
okay
so far no one is any the wiser let's go
back
go back to the dining room okay
yeah and if emma described what she saw
to me like that waviness i would be
looking for that too i imagine emma's
looking for that too
yeah do we see that you did not see that
you just had the feeling
again that you were being watched
somewhere
how close is it to dinner yeah i want to
take a step back
into the door and just kind of pick my
head back into the door behind us
into the kitchen yeah okay the
kitchen
is a home of activity apparently
cheesecake is for dessert tonight they
are
uh they are at work baking several
cheesecakes
is it a gas stove oh yes
okay does anyone hear a great dane
[Laughter]
i love it all right so we we reconvened
in the
actually we probably would probably
reconvene in one of our suites so we're
not like yes
before i do that though when i'm back in
the hallway where i got the feeling i
and watch what happens
all right anyone's too gleeful about
that um
wait what what number is this oh no it's
like 84.
no all right so you light a match and
a like a guy coming out of the
kitchen
says oh no frontline please um
open flames in a dirigible are a very
bad idea
all right so i blow it out and like
watch
the smoke does it i'm just trying to see
like
air patterns or something um
it will drift towards the kitchen
okay and it doesn't sort of make a weird
anything it's just a straight okay yeah
hmm fine yeah let's go all right
so i went back to my i just you know
left and went back
sure yeah so dinner comes once and again
and yes
donal as alex i'll actually like like
have my hand on the table and count down
to when it happens and then right when
she says it's gonna happen a waiter
drops
a a a large tray of food very apologetic
everyone comes and and cleans it up
doctor did you what then was he saying
in his sleep but did you hear any of
that
uh the only word i could make out was
constanta
what does that mean like constantinople
oh i i ping a waiter and i asked sure
yeah
your waiter will as he comes up do
you just show him the word and
yeah that is a constant
would be the english word and i just
okay thank you very much boss
uh the cheesecake will be out shortly oh
good
oh sounds less a constant
huh i've heard the two you and ah
emma
referred to that before but i didn't
know joan was graduated to constant
level
so he's he's looking around for a
constant
or no i mean it could i again
that's one word right that's one word
you heard i mean it is german
why don't we just still wake this fella
up and ask him i mean it's gonna repeat
anyway it won't matter tomorrow
that's a great idea yeah
i could try knocking on his door again
really hard
donald can get into his room anytime he
wants now i'm sure i'm sure it's not
locked again
of course you got to have dessert all
right so you you will go
to his room the whole lot of you
uh dancing starts which is a lovely
distraction yeah i i i hear the music
start and like look back longingly and
sigh quietly
over over dessert i want to just in case
this happens again
uh i like to tell everyone like a a
small little story
and then say like if if this day repeats
to come to me tomorrow
and repeat this story to me because you
wouldn't you wouldn't know it
and okay then and then
just just to be just to be sure
yeah i'll i'll i'll work on committing
it to memory
sure yeah that's no problem
all right you get to his room and
it is not locked everybody make me
oh cool no one short
you can send it out you're not looking
to get rid of it
i don't know do those things carry over
keep telling yourself that
uh so um
uh yeah so let's see most people made
it all right yeah
um you go in and
um the room has not been cleaned uh
the he is still lying there in bed
like
completely fevered
the sheets are soaked instead of
breaking in this time can we just knock
on the door
actually the door is unlocked we don't
have to break in
he didn't re-lock it yeah donald did not
donald's very good at unlocking doors
it would still be polite if we're gonna
talk to him okay
all right there's an option
well i i i i will i will tell him that
we were worried about him and we brought
a doctor so you're waking him up
are we wake him up go ahead i'd i'd like
to
who's waking him up
all right you go to touch him and he is
burning up like he clearly has a a
a pretty serious fever okay then i i i
don't want to catch what he's got
oh doc what should we do
i'll go i'll go take his you know i'm
gonna go i'm gonna go to my room and get
my medicine bag
all right yeah you step out the
dancing is
is in in fine swing um
no all right everything's fine
um okay you
you go back to your room you grab your
medicine bag you head
you head back are you gonna like you
want to give this guy an examination
yeah so you can do medicine or first aid
you'll get
first aid will give you like triage
information medicine will give you like
you know
lupus triage i rolled the other dice
because i was mixing it up and that
would be a
pretty sure that's critical yeah that's
critical success
damn and this was medicine right this is
medicine
okay so yeah he has
a very high fever he's probably
uh hallucinating he is um
uh he he seems like
you know he hasn't he's hasn't
eaten today he seems like he's
dehydrated
and you know needs to get fluids in him
um he's not not in a good way yeah i'm
gonna start
i'm gonna start taking care of him all
right ask ask people like go get water
and suck yeah towel and unless there's a
towel around here who knows
there are you know there are all sorts
of clothing items that you can use as
towels or you can use towels
um are you telling the ship's staff
that's what i was going to ask should i
should i tell them
oh we would have to explain what we were
doing
in here a doctor could treat him just
fine
true i can explain that with that i was
friends his and i brought him a doctor
cool all right i'll i'll i'll go fetch
some some water
okay yeah no problem joan before you
leave
oh okay i thought you were going
someplace sorry oh no i thought about it
i was talking about should we go talk to
somebody on the ship and
you guys convinced me that it was not
but anyway you were gonna ask me about
what do you have an elder sign
i have a little one that i made a long
time ago that
i've had no you don't but i
yeah i think i lost it the one i made a
that dragon that i i don't know this
oh that's right
i forgot about that whoever he was
destroyer of worlds yes yep
all right no i don't have one right now
okay have anything to protect
we could we could try to put one on but
yeah
i don't want to do that here what's
wrong with him what
what's the situation doctor he's got a
beeper
i'm putting like a wet towel on his head
and i'm trying to like pop him up and
get him get
some fluids i'm probably grinding up
some aspen or something to
into the fluids to yeah you are you are
treating him
if you want you can stay here you know
as long as you want and treat him
um but he he does not um
he doesn't really come he filters in and
out of consciousness but he's
you know he's he's only semi-coherent
yeah he's only speaking german the only
and any basic german i can do for like
drink
swallow yeah heat rest
if i can get him to eat something you
think you know you you'd maybe try some
soup you could maybe try some soup
while this is going on i'll start
searching his room i got nothing else to
do
everybody let's see here everybody make
me
i want to call this role everybody make
me a sanity role except the
doctor when we're searching
i will gracefully accept you now yeah
hard hard hard standing hard
hard when i'm searching i'm gonna see if
the doctor has um
ether and morphine in this bag
oh no so everybody that missed it
you're not gonna lose sanity
but you remember the flu epidemic
of 1918 clearly it wasn't that long ago
and so seeing somebody like this with
the flu has you both
you know you both are you both are
concerned and don't really want to be in
that room
nope i'm just immediately take my little
scarf and i'm like
i could go to the kitchen and see if
they have soup
yeah sure he'll if it's liquid he can he
can get it down
but he's very weak broth i'll get
some broth
okay let's continue to look around
doctor you're sure he's not sick
i mean it's i mean the fact that he
hasn't been
it's hard like chicken or the egg like
he hasn't been eating and drinking so
his
if there's any particular symptoms that
would make it stand out from like just
yeah so that flu was um
you know the hallucinations and stuff
um there also wasn't i want to be like
all right i'd like to go clean up
can't hear you i'm gonna go clean up
all right yeah nope
i'm still digging around i'm still
looking around do i do we come across
anything
including ether are you searching in
like dr hollister's bag
if he's not gonna be attentive to it yes
i have it like right next to me yeah hey
am using it
actively it's almost like he doesn't
trust you lot that much he's
he's keeping it in sight the whole time
um looking around the room
um it looks like you've you've uh
you've cased some rooms in your time uh
you don't think this room
was cased by other people you think this
was
the count like going through everything
in the room and throwing everything out
looking for something because
you know there wasn't like you know the
look under the mattresses
you know tear open the pillows that sort
of thing this was
this was more i need to find something
where is it
okay does he have anything here that is
suspicious to us that we
stands out to us no
no there's there's nothing um
he and at that point it's about
one in the morning at this point you've
been in this room
now for you know five hours um
and he the count wakes
and like kind of looks around
semi-lucidly
what does that mean doctor you can make
a german roll
it sounded like outside yeah that's what
it sounded like to me
hmm i'll best ask someone on the staff i
suppose
how long should you stay in this room
are there
windows in this room there are but
the windows do not open no that's fine
i'm i'm i'm gonna go over to the window
because it sounded a little bit like
outside to me too and just like look to
see if there's anything weird
oh you're gonna see a gremlin on the
wings god damn it
even weirder you're gonna see wings on a
zeppelin
uh no there it is dark out it is
pitch black you are over the atlantic
ocean it is cloudy
um and there you don't see and
you don't see any little beasties
hanging around outside
okay all right
yeah i don't think we should stay here
much let's let him sleep let's let him
sleep we need to get some sleep too
right
yeah we'll see if we wake up on the 9th
or the 10th
all right everyone's going to bed well
then that will be the first test if
you're if you are in your room when i
wake up
try that leave the doctor here not by
himself
doctor are you okay let me stay here by
yourself
all right everybody else goes to bed
yep doctor you um
you start to fall asleep and all of a
sudden
in the room there's a shimmering effect
and standing in front of you
almost ignoring you is one of the
ships is is the waiter that was
and he is like dismissively
um
he's like looking around the room
like
ignoring literally ignoring you
can i act like i'm just like half asleep
or something
yeah sure i'm not okay at all
yeah i'll try and like peripherally
do like cracks of my eyes if i don't
know probably can't make it out but i
don't wanna
just ask him what he's doing yeah
you really want if i don't know this is
this is different than that if you want
to inspire this
you know that's what is your spot hidden
nick low
that's how you survive in call of duty
minimum 25
i'll just get i'll just stand up and ask
if i can help him
all right you stand up he pulls
something that looks like a fork out of
his
um and he looks at you
and he takes his hand and he peels
the head off and and there is a snake
face
in front of you and he says
the only thing i regret is that you'll
be
back tomorrow and then the last thing
you remember is there's a
sound almost like the sound of
and you wake up the next morning as the
butler comes in
at 9am and you don't remem none of that
happened
all right and i think eggs benedict
again
i think we are going to go to break
so one second let me let me hook up

you want to look smart i'm going to
admit that i'm dumb
as i was like hey is it broken j
matthews keeps saying the same thing
props to julie who went like he's doing
groundhog day
i was i was dumb but julie was yeah i i
didn't get it either and
i i didn't get it either until julie
mentioned it or said oh
he's writing the same thing in a tone
and i was like oh duh
yeah that makes sense well again he
should well never mind anyways
i was like you should have written the
my original idea for this was to have
like some music cue but then that causes
all sorts of sound problems and who
knows what
uh because that is you know that is the
classic of having some piece of music
that plays every single time
yeah yeah super supernatural really
leaned into that one

reasons i can't i'm always down for a v

what did you code in this story oh i
wanna you don't you don't need to tell
me that if you don't if it's something
that you wanna
okay yeah so yeah you what's the
story is not right there's something
wrong
why is why are you bringing up this this
you know for the constant things
yeah okay um
so so yeah it is breakfast again
um the duke is not out this time oh he
got promoted
sorry the account is not out this time
i i i think we need to go and
help him now i think this is the third
time around
you know you there's something weird
going on here hollister are you gonna
are you gonna tell him you're telling
the story are you telling him there's a
time loop and all this stuff
i'll i'll tell him the story first um
and then if he asks how how do you know
that story
oh no the the story is actually weird to
me mm-hmm
like it it's like i know this story but
but a part of it's off like it's been
like and i explained like you know
there's like this reference to this
being constant like that's that's not a
part of the story why
are you telling me this i'm telling you
this because
we are stuck in a time loop and i'm
going to have to keep explaining this
over and over again until we figure this
out
waiter can i get a bottle of vodka
please
who had emma leaning in to the time
time loop calories don't count
i might stab somebody later because it
doesn't count
i'll loan you a dagger oh the calorie
thing i didn't think of
more cheesecake okay
you you know that you're in a time loop
but i don't know
that we're in a time loop right why
would that be
it has it has something to do with the
concept that we've run into before about
people being constants
that a version of them exists in every
universe
um i knew that emma and i were constants
but i didn't know joan was
like i'm eating i'm like the universe
doesn't like you and i'm like mouthful
pointing at him with my fork okay so are
we all together right
there yeah yeah you're all sitting there
is this the start
is this the start of the time loop yes
we we we know well it starts it starts
when we wake up
it starts it starts with the butler
waking us up and saying good morning it
is saturday may
may 9th well that's a great question did
we
do something last night and i mean three
nights ago last night
to trigger it in the morning well
we'll explain what happens in this loop
okay so i will i will lay out the the
the events of
of of the day i'll i'll be like normal
loop the normal
um you you you and donald go go and have
a have a psychotherapy session the first
iteration i wouldn't had a session with
you i didn't have time this last
iteration at at lunch the
dinner that there's gonna be a waiter
who drops a big ol thing of food
and i'll i'll like name the songs that
none of this is and
that's it we just we we have a day
the thing that's different right now is
the count
the count isn't a hair the county isn't
here he usually comes in through
breakfast he usually comes in breakfast
and looks at
everybody looks at them hard and but
he's he and
every time we go through this he gets
weaker and weaker and weaker
he may not be weak if you may he not be
be well enough to get out
we need to go see him all right why why
the three of you
are why is it three of you i don't
understand you just before you are stuck
in the blue
because they're well apparently they're
aware well apparently we're all
in the loop but they're aware of it
because they're constants
or we're just i don't know anything
about this constant thing but all i know
is that
uh i have i'm like
drinking doing shots of vodka be like
anyone else yeah
i'll actually take one of those shots
yeah i've done this i've done this a
what does that mean a couple times what
does that mean i mean that this is the
third time that we have woken up on may
9th
it's my third saturday and we haven't we
haven't we haven't learned anything
other than for dinner that doctor
is we haven't learned anything important
other than
who else is doing this just the three of
you is there anyone else on this
um zeppelin who's going through the same
thing
i haven't really taken a poll on who is
batshit crazy
besides me on this boat let's find find
out no we haven't we haven't seen
anything different we haven't seen
anything different
happening except for that for us and the
count
and also and and and i'll tell them
about what emma saw
uh with with with the wavy line and the
sense that we were being watched by
someone invisible um
because we've run into that before
alexandria how did we
kill the person the last time the
invisible
person i mean i don't have a fat
candle that was
years ago for a fat candle no no
well they had the fat candle as long as
it was
they were invisible he ran out and he
was trying to get a new candle
and so he wasn't he like he got
overconfident and he was like revealing
himself to you and then he would go
invisible and then he ran out
uh i believe he got shot or stabbed
and he was bleeding out
so we were able to find him because he
got injured
okay yeah we we found him because we
were able to injure him but i
or but i didn't i was listening very
carefully when we were in the hallway
and i
could not we should try to get to the
count
earlier guys than we did before we
should try to get to him earlier before
he
if he's not well i'll go grab my bag
yeah that sounds great let's go what
what what happened last time
what have i missed what happened last
time they had cheesecake for dessert
that's it and the count wasn't well
the count was sick and we tried to to to
make him well so we need to go earlier
we went too late
now we need to go earlier and try to see
if we can get him to be better well and
no everything's fine i was i'm actually
more worried in the fact that
if he's not here already he's the he's
the other one
that seems to cumulatively
and i'm just struggling for words right
now because i've been drinking and
eating
yeah yeah yeah i know he's been getting
worse
while the rest of us are still fine and
eating another eggs
yeah so yeah no he was he was really
bad off last time so
um i think we should go we should go try
to fix him earlier and then maybe we can
find out what's going on
yeah see you you were dr hollister
you examined him in the livestream i got
up and left to get my medicine stuff
oh that's right dr hollister examined
him in the last
iteration and he was having a fever and
hallucinations
and was muttering the word constant all
right so at breakfast
you you you abruptly get up emma is
are you going to stay eating or are you
going to go with them i'm going to take
a doggie bag though and take my bottle
of popcorn
yes they they were just bringing you
the donuts you asked for
and so you go to his door
it is locked called knock okay um
i don't you're snoring if you
listen you can kind of hear low moaning
okay
is anyone in the hallway is it coast
clear i'll i'll immediately turn in like
he
and like start keeping watch it seems
like the coast is clear
i'll get the lockpicks out all right
take care of it
german locks it give me some trouble so
yeah you know
you feel like you've seen this lock
somewhere before but it's just it's
you you can't quite get it it takes
you a while
and we didn't want to ask anybody to
open the door for us i mean we have a
legitimate concern that he was feeling
unwell last night
everybody make me a luck role okay every
time he misses the pick lock we go
through
the luck rolls and let me know if you
fumble
98 yes all right
oh my god i'm the only one who made it
yep yeah
so donal is um
is down there working on the door and um
the kitchen door opens and there is a
porter
and he like looks you all he says can
i help you all
yeah i was supposed to meet with the
count but he's not there so we were
we were trying to see if we could knock
i see can we get somebody to help us and
is anyone standing in front of donald
yes yes yeah yeah
as yeah they like slide in front of him
we were going to give a note under his
door that's why he's kneeling
we're going to we're we're putting a
push trying to put a note under his door
but if you can get us
in that would be awesome yeah he said
that he was not feeling well yesterday
and we have not seen him at breakfast
and we're very concerned he looked quite
peaked
he said he was not feeling well
yesterday
oh i'll have a shot at that yeah i i was
speaking with him
uh in great detail he he seemed
he said you know maybe it'll be
something in the past you know what you
get the itch in your throat
and the the light sensitivity
yeah maybe i'm a doctor and i hold up my
medicine bag
right oh well of course doctor yes he
seemed um
he seemed very well yesterday when i
spoke with him
oh no like i was saying he he felt like
he would he could be coming down with
something and wanted
no well by all means of course uh
uh thank you doctor um
and everybody make a psychology role
oh can i make a persuade role instead
he's gonna he he's doing what you want
okay ooh
i made it you made it two oh two o two
that's
awesome all right um
so he's a psychologist
i'm not actually a very good
psychologist joan you have seen this
before
um much to your detriment he is like
but yes of course let me go and uh
get the get the key for you thank you
and he'll go back
into the kitchen donald get donald go
back and go get this
he comes back in about five minutes with
uh
the key and he opens the door and
um and as he he opens it a little bit
and he knocks on it and he says
hello
we already tried knocking yeah yes uh
uh
he he opens the door full and
um he will he'll say oh please
doctor come in come in
uh and he will
um you know he'll he'll actually like
intercede and try and keep the rest of
you from coming in
yeah and he stands at the door and the
doctor goes in
um and and he he um
he will ask which one of you seems the
most trustworthy
oh god actually
but he's not he can't ask you donal
he will ask you in a a in a a pure
chauvinistic moment i was gonna say
that's
so a chauvinist move a german move
yeah he asked you
to go into the kitchen and
ask for the bursar
to come and join them oh all right i'll
go get this fella
sure okay left to the kitchen okay
um and yeah you you go and you get the
burster and he'll be there
shortly so hollister he this guy has
a
very bad fever he seems
um he's not he doesn't seem that weak
he's he he seems a little dehydrated but
you know it seems like maybe the the but
he's
all right yeah i'll start what do you
jeez no can i can i get a can i get some
inspiration
what happens if you kill him i'm bound
to fail sooner or later
like it's a matter of time oh that was
that was not a critical fumble
was that was that an amy though yes it's
you know you are surprisingly
competitive in the amy competition
what is this surprisingly he
deliberately uses bad dice
um so you this guy you don't know what
is wrong with this guy this does this
this like
this is not anything you recognize it's
kind of like a fever but
not and the onset because i saw him
yesterday
right yeah very it's it happened so
quickly
you don't know what's going on here i'm
i'm just gonna try and treat treat
the symptoms at this point try and get
his uh
yeah you you know you'll do the same
thing you did last time with with
hydrate you know and try and get some
soup in him
um the bursar will return with donal
and he will have a brief conversation in
german with the
uh with the the porter who's there
uh and then uh
the bursar says something to the porter
and the porter like kind of disagrees
and the burster says something a a
little sterner and the porter agrees and
the porter leaves
um and the burster uber says
um you are a doctor yes
yes that's correct is the count uh
all right no
i and i have no idea the the the
severity of this from when i saw
him yesterday this doesn't make any
sense yes i
i spoke with the count yesterday and he
was fine
yeah yeah the three ladies are all going
to exchange a look from the from the
hallway
yeah oh well this is uh
um and he'll sort of like bring you all
in
conspiratorially and say like i would
ask that you not
that you please keep this quiet we do
not need
any sort of panic doctor do you think
anything any
with this is contagious i mean i'd like
to
how is this how does this room look
right now
oh is it torn to shreds it is yes the
room is still tossed
um i i'd like to see if i can look
through
i mean it's possible he could have been
taking something maybe
of course of course i'm not sure um
ladies and gentlemen if you don't mind
um the doctor is going to
take care of the count if you will
excuse us
i'm going to he's he's going to
leave you alone there doctor he's he
doesn't
can anyone else stay with me
i help this fella out i i'd love anyone
who's good at looking through
the stuff to try and figure out if
there's any uh
yeah any any like bottle of pills or
anything like that through this mess
we're gonna have to go through his
entire room and the sooner
the sooner i can figure out if there's
something in his system
the sooner i can do something about it
um
see and i and i do want to want to catch
the burster before before he leaves and
like draw him a little aside and say
you say that you spoke with the count
yesterday
yes it may it i i
don't know if it has any bearing on this
but
i wonder well can i ask you
what you spoke about if it isn't too
sensitive
yeah the count had misplaced something
um did he say what it was maybe we can
maybe we'll find it going through things
trying to find the pills
uh the account misplaced a watch
a watch oh wasn't that convenient
i i i pulled him aside i'll tell you
guys when i come back in
a watch no again please
i would like to give the doctor the room
and he starts
like well no and i i i say i want
what i i think what donal and alexandria
would be the best to look at the room
probably i want them to stay and help me
look
doctor until you can assure me that this
is not contagious
i'd want as few people in this room as
possible
it's already done and so i should
quarantine you all to this room
well then you'll have to quarantine
yourself as well
and that's a great idea and and the
porter who just left here
that's not the point look it might be
nothing and the sooner we can go through
his room and find out if maybe this is
just
like a mix of medication this could just
be
but if it was if it was food poisoning i
would expect other people
and from what i saw from breakfast
everyone else seemed fine so i don't
believe that's the case
the bursar is now holding a handkerchief
over his face
what do i have to do very well
uh commence your search i shall wait
here and once it is done
uh we will leave and the doctor will
remain with the patient
yeah no i and and i i don't need to be
in here for this i
i'm i i mean this in the nicest possible
way the count is a
and i must ensure that none of his
belongings none of his other belongings
disappear yeah i i'll murmur remember
something under my breath in italian
um he will reply to you in italian uh
uh that he says if you're on a
zeppelin you're already rich
true so
is the room shut like can i
because the burster is the burster
closes the door but stays
inside the room okay so there are now
six of you in a not seven people really
with the bed
no but i wouldn't be outside sprinkling
vodka looking for my suspect
all right oh all right you see yeah you
are outside the door sprinkling vodka
demon wherever you are
do you need a dagger possibly but
blessed be those who drink vodka and
[Music]
what number is this 81 come on i got
these dice are terrible where's the
birds of paradise yeah why are they
the birds of paradise i don't know do i
try again
do we just do it yeah do it do it do it
crazy
come on baby come on birds
oh better 34 i made it bye all right
go birds of paradise you have that
same
feeling of being watched but you don't
like have a sense
it's it's again it's it's omnipresent it
feels like it's everywhere
okay so i'm still gonna just like
try and hone in on it just be like let
me try over here like do the hotter
colder thing
right right yeah yeah that's no problem
you know
um you guys in the room you search the
room um
you're very efficient about this you
find
uh a great deal of money
uh you find like a a a like essentially
a case of money
uh you find um
you find a pistol what currencies marks
deutsch marks you find uh
uh you find a pistol and
okay is the count so i'm i'm focused on
the count this whole time
is he coming he's hallucinating he's i'm
assuming he's still speaking in german
yeah every once in a while he'll say
again either constanta or he'll say uh
site i i asked the uh
the bursar what the what
yeah if the burster can provide a
translation of what he's mumbling that
might be
the burster does not want to put his
he'll tell you that earth sight means
watch
watch okay so it's somewhere on the
left some someone took it we just have
would would you be willing to describe
what this watch would look like
he was no there was not my it's a gold
pocket watch
he said it was very valuable to him and
very important to him
perhaps
uh and i will now ask that everyone
accept the doctor please
yes we will be serving lunch tonight
uh doctor thank you would you do you is
it is it um
is it useful for you to stay here or do
you just want
if at any point he becomes lucid
i'd love to be able to ask him some
questions but
my german is not very good i can have a
crewman
uh stationed at the door that would be
fantastic
very well so yeah he'll
he'll he'll arrange that porter to just
sort of stand by the door
um and he tells you that he will
uh he will call you if any he'll come
and have someone come and find you if
there's any change
and then you know he thinks after every
meal you should just give him a checkup
okay so so i
i want to talk to the the other ladies
and said did
did you guys ever see that presence
that was lurking around that you told me
about
no but it's here i can feel it i just
can't find it as i'm like
yeah i'll almost flicking vodka around
i'll come up to where she is and see if
i can sense that sense again
no you don't know okay
but we should go and find the the
gentleman that he was yelling at
yesterday
we should go talk to him or toss his
room
the the porter that he was yelling at or
the person who was following him around
at lunch
that one yeah but he yelled at him
yesterday he yelled at him yesterday
yeah all right okay
um so you at lunch
it's very easy to find that guy because
he is like what
he is doing what the count was doing
he's like looking
oh he's like he's he's he's basically
pretending to refill water
as he is very like not
terribly subtly like watching everybody
looking for something that peop looking
for some
something that people are doing right
rather suspicious
well he comes to us i ask him if he
speaks english
when he's trying to pour our waters yes
of course i speak english
oh you look like you're looking for
something
no everything is fine is there a
reward fella maybe
we find it for you we give it to you
give us a reward huh actually could you
yeah well it's lunchtime so it must be
uh 12 30 12. you know exactly what time
it is
i'm sorry i do not have a watch okay
thank you i'll i'll ask someone else
thank you everybody make a psychology
role
good luck no oh my god
my am i there yeah yeah oh i i
failed failed failed failed 98. i got
fumbled yeah outstanding
i don't know what to get i got a 15. i
got a regular success
all right so um
so tiana you will uh
when when she when when emma does her
watch thing
like the guy immediately you see him
like immediately like going like
she said watch and like kind of looking
at her
um joan
you are watching this guy like a hawk
and you would swear
his shadow on the floor
when you see like he's standing up
straight seems like a normal person
oh make me a sanity roll yeah snake
yeah this guy's a that's a snake
wait till it goes away before you say
that oh and i didn't make it
oh no all right you lose two sanity
and all you can think about is
miles shipley's mother
she wouldn't know that no she wouldn't
which were they oh no they weren't
remember they were on all of the stuff
the new great dane society we never went
to we never went to have it oh you
didn't go there that's right
after after we went to yeah remember
that was
thomas stabbed me yeah whatever his name
was that week that's right
so yeah then then joan this guy this
guy's
you know you just are sure there's
something sinuous about him yeah
it would be so great if you like leaned
i was thinking about that because of
what i what i rolled
yeah all right uh
and then and he'll but he'll like
he definitely gives you
a look yeah well i'm looking back at him
well
um you see um
the count has lost something
of great value to him oh really
and he's looking for he asked me to look
for it
hmm is it something that's worn
on the head you were looking very
if you see this watch if you see a gold
pocket watch please
would you let me know certainly um
is there anything special i mean most
people carry pocket watches is there
anything special about this one an
engraving
i'm afraid that's the only descriptions
that i have it's just a gold pocket
watch
well that's unfortunate yes yes um
you can yes but if you find
something please
uh just let me know
i am um
[Music]
i am you can you can ask
uh for hair sisic
all right certainly thank you very much
thank you so much
and like he does an unsubtle like look
right so i don't trust that guy
at all get him into some dark corner or
some room by himself
i our our our minds run along the same
track
there's there's something wrong with
that guy he's a snake
well he's just looking for the watch
that hold on
less because i'm thinking about miles
shipley's mother i'm like
did you see his shadow no oh do we have
time to look at his shadow
uh the light is wrong now do we have
time to look for human skin
sheddings i'm talking ab nevermind
there's always time for that
i mean i'm not talking about toenail
clippings people
you know you but you mean that literally
he's
literally a snake not you
[Laughter]
oh just like i'm like uh-huh yeah emma's
been drinking again
when he was staring at at you and emma i
i i looked and his chest definitely
everyone really and i'm gonna look at
emma and say
well first off nobody needs to stab me
in the leg today
there's no knitting needles i think
that was weirder than than what i was
thinking so
it's is watching that's up in this room
over here and
come over here and get it and we'll
ambush him
find out what he knows that sounds like
because doc doc let's go check on let's
go check on
uh i know what you're doing
no dude we were supposed to i'm aware of
that yes
we're supposed to go we were supposed to
go after every meal we're supposed to go
and check on him
yes i know plausible denial
bye it's a very liberal use of that i'm
just going to before
i leave you to do
just a horrible mistake it doesn't
matter tomorrow
it'll happen again today or whatever
well then use this time to collect
information instead of ambushing people
this is phase two eat a lot of carbs
stab a lot of people
tomorrow we wake up and go whoops we
shouldn't have done that and then we'll
just do something else tomorrow it'll be
fun
oh no she's been drinking she's been
drinking
leave her let's go see the count
i was going to death anyway you don't
need to escort me
okay all right i was i just thought i'd
because i was worried about him
please use this time wisely don't
don't ambush people
that
and don't patronize me we could commit
i don't know i don't know emma because i
mean we remember theoretically god would
too
or or are we as constants more
you almost hear the voice of the
headdress i am a god
i need to drink some more deal with that
that's good
i still hear it all right so you are
yeah i'm gonna go get a bowl of soup and
i'm gonna go
visit the count yeah and you guys are
going to ask
uh hair sisic is uh
hair cystic for something we we should
probably
give it a couple of hours if we are
going to try to use the we found the
watch
uh excuse to get him alone
that said i'm we should look
everywhere all right so
i'm gonna try to remember where i saw
the count not yesterday but the eighth
what what where where did i see him uh
in in that time frame and just like look
around in those areas to see if maybe he
dropped the damn thing
that would be very anticlimactic the
watch isn't a plant over there
good night everybody all right
someone stole it this is suspects let's
find out who the suspects are and we'll
deal with them one by one process of
elimination well the nice thing
is that there's only 20 passengers
besides us
and how many how many crew members have
we seen how many crew members there are
what i'm worried about so it seems like
it's almost you
you've only seen the service staff like
the the actual engineering and stuff you
haven't seen
um it seems like it's pretty it's like
uh at least 10 that you've seen
staffers someone someone has the watch
and i don't think that it is hair cystic
so if that's okay the fellow who's
looking he doesn't have it why would he
be looking around if he's
you've got it hidden away but someone
else does who else are
the suspects the invisible man
whoever that is that angry blonde guy
who's the ingredient of angry blonde
guys we just got raided
by fateful encounters so welcome
uh thanks so much for joining us
uh i believe that's gonna trigger a
giveaway
with a raid like this thanks for rating
welcome
we're playing call of cthulhu and the
players are currently stuck
in groundhog day on a zeppelin
yeah it's not blowing up so here's the
thing if
you put in hashtag chaos in the chat you
win something but i forgot what
[Music]

just do it all right so yes it is
groundhog day
going on in this uh
in this crazy thing and they are about
to beat up
a poor crewman maybe maybe
uh so you you arranged an ambush
strange and ambushed for her sisic uh
where do you ask him to meet you
here's what i think we should do how
about alexandra's room
um and then emma can get him all hide
behind the door he comes in i close the
door i have him trapped
into the conversation i'm not gonna hit
him with this bottle of vodka
but emma i would ask for a con roll but
emma
i was not close to drunk yet no
i don't think more than groundhog day to
get emma i was gonna say i don't think
i've we've ever seen emma like pro
well once or twice we've seen her
properly drunk yeah a couple times
but i need to try because if it is
groundhog day no repercussions people
no it's like it is like all pass
in the morning for breakfast and you're
telling me that it's after lunch she's
been drinking constantly and she's not
drunk
no emma's liver is medical emma i'm in a
comfortable spot right now
happy birthday emma's liver is actually
that only soaks alcohol up so
yeah you you get him he comes in and
donald
closes the doorbell behind him yeah i
wait what did you say i pulled my gun
out as well oh god
um that's right you snuck a pistol on
board you
pull a gun out and he looks very
surprised
yeah i i don't have any of my daggers
currently drawn but i have i have a hand
near a spot where i can quickly draw one
so i don't know about that pocket watch
should you intimidate or or no yeah sure
make it intimidate roles
i'm there too right you know i can say
yeah you snake
where's the crowbar hard success 17.
all right he like takes a step back
and then the crowbar comes out and he
like takes a step forward and he's like
trying to decide which is worse the
crowbar or the gun
um yes of course of what what
the watch is missing i'm i'm helping his
account find it
what why it's not you don't care about
the watch what does it do
i work for z we he's rich we try to make
him happy
what's the real story of fella there's
something else going on with this
what is the real story and he disappears
oh there it is i was gonna ask him what
 here we go
okay all right
120. yeah he's got that there's no
gorilla here come on
and donald make me
uh make me a dodge roll
so we're gonna do the giveaway for the
birds of paradise dice this time we mean
it
in five minutes and you must be present
to win
but why would you leave i'm about to
kill some people they're not i'm about
to kill some people
yeah i failed that dodge roll with my
penalty
i love you all again want to inspire you
guys what do you think
you roll it all again what is your dodge
it's a 49
so about 50. yeah you should definitely
i'll take one more shot at this
yeah that's a 92 that's not going to do
it all right you just
you're just aiming yeah so
you take 14 points of damage
what kind of damage what's that what's
happening to donald you have been struck
by
lightning so i was wondering yeah okay
um what
yeah all of your body hair
uh success that's a regular success all
right you stay conscious
um but like you have just been flash
fried
all right he'll he'll probably go down
to one on one knee
uh and just feel the pain for a second
make me a
uh make me a luck roll
uh success all right yeah your gun is
uh but you have dropped it yeah okay
um all right that is 120
80s that's donald yeah i mean he can
still
act i was hoping to do is grab the gun
and throw it at where
i think this guy might be just kind of
try to throw it
sure make me a throw roll with a with
a penalty die
right it's a actually you know what just
make me a throw roll it's a small room
okay and my throat is not
that's not bad i've i got 74 though
that's not going to do it you know
for all everyone should have a high
throw roll because grenades always come
up in cthulhu
or dynamite talking how often that
happens so you
throw it and it doesn't bounce off
anybody or anything right all right
that is 80s 70s yeah i'm
i'm going to draw my dagger and just
like light
uh my my lightning fast draw and just
like
i'm i remember where he was i want to
try
and like grab at the air where where
where he was and try to make it and try
to make a knife attack in that area
uh so you're not grabbing you're
stabbing yes
okay but but not like stabbing like more
like a wide slash to try and
okay make me a knife attack with a
penalty die
okay
nice thing about rolling something that
i'm really good at is it's hard to fail
uh that is a hard success even with the
penalty die
all right with a hard success you're
you you hit something and it's solid
not like a body there's like a pink
and briefly very briefly this
wall of hexagons kind of
flashes and you see you see sisic and
you would swear that like his eyes
are reptilian there's like you know
they've got the there there's
um and and your
uh your your knife like hits
some sort of field around him
and and then it's back and he's gone
oh and you saw in his hand he has a fork
of some sort it looks like a fork of
like a
um a weird silver medal is it a
like a eating fork or is it like a no
no it is not an eating fork it is it is
a piece of metal that has
like almost like a tuning fork it's a
tuning fork i recognize this
it is not a tuning fork but that is what
your that is your analogy yes
all right 7060s 60s
60s 60s 60s all right i i saw where that
guy was
i'm just gonna slash out with this sure
swing with that crowbar
don't fumble you have a penalty die okay
penalty diamonds the two bigger ones
right yes
okay two tens yeah yeah yeah yeah
wow what
whoa okay um
what that's fumble probably no it was
they're they're both good but one of
them was better than the other i i did
make it because my my regular crowbar is
49 i got a 44.
okay roll your head up 04 for the other
one
actually wait i shouldn't be mean i
didn't make tiana roll damage i'm not i
was gonna say
uh it's the same thing you bang up
against whatever this
this field around him is and just
like you are he's just sort of bemusedly
watching all of this
all right so i do see that that he has a
field around him okay
all right that was 60s emma's
okay yeah bottom line up so i've seen
the thing
hit twice like the hexagons twice
oh no let's light the blimp on fire
groundhog day
[Laughter]
no consequences so
betting that there are gonna be
consequences so
like i being neither
a drinker nor someone who plays with
matches i don't know what would happen
if you like
flicked vodka through a a match would it
no so what i would do is i would
actually let me describe this to you
what i do
so i get up to him take his wig i'm like
oh emma's breathing over fire and then
just
whoop right on him all right yeah you
are trying to breathe fire
i'm gonna make you an offer you can take
it
let's do it do
the full damage to him but you're gonna
take damage as well
or you can do you can be safer and he
won't take as much damage
full baby fall all right so you used
to have eyebrows
as you know it turns out that fire
breath is
the the makes it harder so you
will a gout of flame flashes through
the room
the three of you in the room make me a
groundhog day everything's fine made
that at least
yes all right so emma you do a d8
damage
and you're gonna take half of whatever
you do
i'm like hold on where is this oh
that's prep that's crap so two i rolled
a two so i only take one right next to
you do two points of damage but that
like that goes through whatever that
field is
and and he the field like again it
flashes off briefly
and he sort of looks at you like huh
he was not expecting that uh
all right that's right back to 120.
um you hear a disembodied voice
uh will say the funny part is none
of you will remember this tomorrow
and then ooh there's another
zizzit and emma roll me a dodge roll
oh i don't know why
because you don't want to get struck by
lightning
nope not even close all right woof
you take 14 points of damage holy smokes
what happens if i had 19 does that mean
uh you're gonna make me a conroll okay
uh you have just been struck by
lightning
oh can i fumble that
no it's 94 but my con is 80. so that
means that like
our b-roll is worth we inspire it oh
come on
come on do not aim me this
all right you are still conscious um
you have you have just taken a grievous
wound
uh you are you you know every hair
on your body is like smoking
and i went from 20 to five if that gives
anybody
any indication of what happened there
all right that was 120
80. donald trump all right oh is there
any other liquid around any other
bottles any
just this is there it has got a bottle
oh okay there's knives
do we have perfume in here at all i i
what what is
what is the lavatory situation do we
have
it's communal okay so we'd have to go
out in order
to get up but does
emma have any other bottles or is it
connected i was supposed to you can take
the one off my hand i'm literally laying
there like however i fell over
i'm just like zero four zero all right
yeah you find some perfume that you
think is mostly alcohol
a great already in an atomizer i
think just pull the pull the atomizer
out okay
throw the liquid right that this guy as
best i can
all right he likes that perfume i'm
sorry
not tomorrow yeah all right make me
a
uh make me a throw roll oh
i got 53 which is not a success on my
all right
so you get some of the alcohol on him
but he is not like
it's it doesn't start him on fire
anymore can we
inspire it you can yeah i'm definitely
going to inspire it if you want
you have agency we're down to three
inspiration now as far as my tracking
can tell
i still missed this is an emma math we
had four in addition to that so i got
oh yeah you had four to start yeah so we
have seven we had four to start
so we used to actually have seven now uh
you still didn't make it donald so you
you pour some of the liquid on him and
it goes through the field
um but it doesn't like start on fire
uh that was 80s 70s okay i'm gonna
like reach out and touch the field and
just try to get a sense for it
all right it seems to be about um
okay but the perfume made it through
and i'm not able to get a hand through
is there a book of matches anywhere in
this room besides
the one in one hand in the bottle of
vodka yeah
yeah emma's got one although all the
matches just lit in the uh
um yeah i'm i'm on i'm looking i'm
looking for
a book for a book of matches and and
another like you'll find the
matches this round and a bottle of
perfume so next round you can
you can do something why not uh
all right 70s 60s joan
i i got nothing to do with this guy
right now
so i'm actually going to try to hide
in a corner so he can't zap me
sure yeah you were like hiding behind
the bed kind
uh emma i'm gonna just hold up my bottle
and be like
because i can't move i'm at it like i
mean i lost
yes what is it two-thirds of my hit
points at this point i'm like
take the bottle take the bottle like
struggling to hit away
emma's like holding up a boiling thing
of vodka
isn't that like a healing potion for you
you popeye back up you're right you're
right as i'm like take the bottle i was
like no hang on wait a minute
yeah okay take a break but first let me
get a hit
um
uh all right alexandra make me a dodge
roll
am i do i have a disadvantage guy on
this uh
yes okay
cool 34. all right you take
six points of damage or you as you are
um
and and he'll say like
um and and he'll say like
once i'm done with you i'll find what
i'm looking for
and then finally this accursed time loop
will
end um
interesting and uh
yeah that was that 80s donald oh
taking emma's bottle all right yeah
you've got a bottle of vodka
just turning around to face this guy and
then try to just douse
him with the rest of the vodka all right
uh
make me a make me a con roll all
right here we go
43 success all right yeah so yeah you
get you just start pouring vodka on him
and he he seems amused uh
all right 80s 70s all right i
am going to like i'm basically i'm
i'm i'm going to go like right up to the
shield and like spray this spray the
perfume and do
do like a little line back and then
all right let's call that a dex roll
with a penalty die
cool app in the box
neat just made it all right so yeah
there is a whoosh
uh and because i'm trying
i'm trying to like link the alcohols
without being able to physically get
through
right there is um
yeah there is a you made a regular
success
hard success hard success okay
yeah then he is you have lit him on
fire and he goes
what i
got his attention at least for that i'll
uh and there's a weird smokey smell well
i mean this room now smells terrible
yeah we can't open windows there's
several human
bodies that have been have been
burned uh
so that was uh
okay this is what i'm gonna do i don't
know if it's gonna do anything but what
i'm gonna try to do
is take a sheet and throw it over
him i like it all right um
just should do that with decks or
yeah sure make a deck roll with a
penalty die ah
okay
yes okay cool so yes there is now
a sheet like it's it's a
it's not a man-shaped thing it's over
like
all right yeah all right emma
hmm let's see
what is there anything else near me that
i could potentially grab
like at this point i'm just kind of like
looking for a knife or something
like at this yeah you're in alexandria
yeah there are knives everywhere
i was just if i can grab one that's
close and then you know kind of get back
and
get close to i just stab him in the foot
or the leg or whatever
down there same thing you stab down and
you hit
the with the sheet it's easy to hit him
but it hits that physical thing
and bang uh
it doesn't make it through okay
uh on a 120 you hear him say
fine i'll see you tomorrow and you see
a lightning bolt shoot up through the
roof of the zeppelin
oh no and you hear
a rumble on top of you as
the entire structure of the zeppelin
starts to like go on flame oh no
it's at that point as you you all
like in a in a in a brief moment
you all kind of look up and you can see
that time stops and sitting
why are you idiots even here
does time stop for us as well we're
awake no you're all
you're all conscious okay the doctor
is
you know some doesn't even realize time
has stopped is we cut to the doctor and
he's just like
feeding soup to the um
you hear there's a shudder doctor and
you you hear like a
i'm just i'm i'm i'm pondering what they
might have done
yes
why do you have any idea
how unlikely it is for constance to get
it's not very pleasant i'll tell you
that
the rules of time travel are so
byzantine already
and you managed to go and them up
anyway
but i'm just saying give us one more day
because like first of all i gotta fix
all this
maybe two more days because like or
maybe three more days because here's the
thing
i gotta fix my burnedness we've got to
i don't know what should we do tomorrow
i mean we haven't killed anybody
like i what uh
[Music]
we should do all kinds of crazy stuff
tomorrow so like today we should blow up
the blimp and live and then tomorrow
what should we do because i ate a lot of
stuff and drinking i'm ready
to blow up the blimp yeah yeah we're
already about to die
but i'm saying tomorrow maybe we can
like do something else
and then we can find like no
and i'm like i think you've never
experienced the black pharaoh before
um and donald both of you make me sanity
rolls
oh donald's donald's running around but
yeah they made a deal
don't yeah i don't think i've ran into
role
[Laughter]
um you lose
eight sanity let's inspire that can we
inspire that
yeah that's a lot sure i'll re-roll if
you
if you if you fail i'll even be nice and
re-roll the sand loss
okay i will try to oh kind and gracious
dm gm
of course he rolled a d20 so he could
average at 10.
i've seen that happen once with with
that
is this no i rolled the exact same thing
again it said oh it's a nit
all right oh you only lose seven sanity
so you um
oh fight no guy is gonna no guy is gonna
tell me
make first make me an intelligence role
okay a regular just regular intelligence
role
yeah mate okay i just wondered if there
no
i'm intelligent too my god these dice
okay different guys
all right all right so you
vistas have opened to you that you have
never
considered there are extra planar beings
you see the galaxy in his eyes
and you realize this is a figure of
pre-history
you gain five cthulhu mythos okay
which means your max sanity is now uh
uh now only 95.
unless oh you had cthulhu amitos already
and you
um
you are so overwhelmed by
everything you've seen here that
you
you will for dramatic purposes
you actually leap out of the hole in the
zeppelin
you just you're just like i can't take
it
and you are out of the zeppelin you
plummet
several a long ways down to the atlantic
ocean
uh probably to be back tomorrow
um i thought i'd be entranced with
having a a black pharaoh in front of me
but i said
nope nope i
the problem is you realized how small
you are
how infinitesimal in the power of the
universe and
that's a very hard thing for someone to
look at emo i can't win
if you keep doing this day over and over
and over we would very much like to be
free
of of this day i'm like
it's a solution though it's it is a
solution
sisick here i've stolen
the oculus of set it was
an item created by
a a very learned man
eons ago
it was to help people who dealt with
temporal
instability you see time is very
and temporal instability throws off
count fonduen is a constant
but he's a temporally unstable constant
and what you see with his sickness is
what happens
when temporal instability hits a
constant
from that item cures that instability
the serpent men
need it to travel back to their original
time
they took his watch that has caused the
temporal instability to start up again
you oh blunt instruments fix this
stop this day from happening over and
over get him back his watch
and let me get on with ending your
stupid world
you said serpent men
is there are are there others besides
hair systems
this one doesn't have there's another
one on this ship
yes i know who but
we don't do we want to fix this do we
want to fix this
yes do i need to make you go away as
well
i'm going to reach out and protectively
put a hand on his shoulder
all this anyway it doesn't matter
i'm not one of your bloody constants no
it matters very much if a constant
dies in a time loop this whole
this multiverse ends
it's going to take me a few i'm going to
bash it you like crawl over
i'll i'll i'll help him up for god's
sakes
mortals he'll like wave his hand and
there's like an image there
and you see joan screaming as she falls
and she stops this far over the water
and she's just
so i go up and poke him in the arm
fine you can talk again so where's the
watch
i mean if you know everything and you're
like a god
where's the watch i'm not
like a god i am a
i am the i am the
where's watch it's emma you know emma
the serpent men
have it i told you who are they here is
one of them
when you idiots made let him know that
you knew there was a time loop
he knew that he had to get rid of you
if they kill they think if they kill the
constants the time loop ends they want
the time loop to end as much as you do
are this are the serpent men so if
cystic doesn't have the watch then the
you have to write that down to figure
that out oh shut up
yeah hang on hang on let me get this
hold on here
has the watch and how am i
losing to you idiots
ooh so i'm gonna go back to that in a
second but hang on a second so how do we
kill the burst or to get the watch we
don't have to kill him we just have to
pick his pocket
yeah but we also can't see him yes we
can
exactly nine million
seven hundred fifty six thousand three
hundred and twelve
subjects in which you have no
in which you come nowhere near my
ability
killing people is the one thing
that you might be better than me at and
you ask
me how to kill him i'm going to give him
a very smarmy little smile and get
and cursing yes that is i am good at
that
i'm like the 1920s equivalent of a high
five be like just
anybody nobody hello no i'll i'll
equivalent back i'm starting to become
very frustrated with you lot only
starting we aren't doing our job right
emma
you know the rules to the game play by
the rules
the fact that you were able to find us
means that the rules aren't as set as i
thought they were
i'm omniscient you're you're not they're
finding
us listen the the rules bit are you on
we close this loop we clarify that
little bit
perhaps yes yes you close this loop
you go you do you try and do gray dragon
island
you try to do cairo you try to do kenya
that's how the game is played you try to
do australia
yeah australia noted
that's how the game is played so what do
you think of this stanford kid
he understands how the game is played he
i will say that carl stanford
does not believe you are the threat that
i know you are
he underestimates you he would have
killed us at great dragon island if he
if he knew i'm rather glad to be
underestimated
he could have he could have does add an
interesting twist to the game
is the other aspect
at gray dragon island the one that
that that was at hofing's compound
what yeah i was curious if
that's where she is so is that little
she's a ghoul not a vampire get the
terms right
all stanford has a number it has quite a
cautery
you traveled with a gorilla for a while
flynn flint is a wonder and a delight
and he doesn't eat humans
i'm going to put you all to sleep that
means the next day will begin
you will fix this and the game will
continue
that's what's with you i can't do it for
you
you know the rules of the game you gave
us enough information to be pointed in
i i mean i don't know how i haven't en
ended the world twice with you people
you need
you you are you are the diva waiting for
your
waiting for your opening note you have
to wait until the time is right
oh is that vodka he'll like pick up the
last bit of the bottle
help yourself i prefer mead
um i haven't had meat in a long time
anyway
really i prefer myself tomorrow
as far as you're concerned it will be
this morning
all right let's get this over with good
morgan
it's it's saturday may 9th okay
emma joan so um
donald you wake up feeling fine joan you
wake up
screaming yes you are falling and
uh you are a plunging
and and you're in your bed emma you wake
up
and you smell burnt
human skin ew i'm like
and what's my what's my hit point
uh you're back to normal you were about
to have full hit points
wait what's my sanity again oh there it
is
no all right fumble no
no just our 71 no all right so you lose
two sanity
from just the overpowering and for the
rest of today for the rest of
this version of today uh
all you you just keep smelling that
burnt like you can't eat any food today
you're just like the idea of food is
disgusting to you okay
and that's fine because i kind of walk
around like you know what i mean

this episode oh
it's time i always end on time it's only
nine o'clock
oh wait we go to 9 30. we have a half
hour what are you on about
well we couldn't stay there that would
i'm old it's a good place to end but no

will keep going so you you wake up
and
you know it's you go to breakfast the
okay yeah no i i i sit up in bed i'm
just like
some has pancakes and eggs this morning

you guys see me i'm touching my bed and
i'm going
yeah i was like
no we we talked about not blowing up we
explicitly discussed
this that's the time you don't remember
i had a bucket list and i'm halfway
through it
unfortunately today we've got some real
business to do
yeah i know pancakes next what business
please that that that that guy
we can't get him we can't do anything
which one
yeah is this really the discussion we're
having at breakfast
yes very concerned
yes no no but no okay look
there was the guy who sat on the bed
and then there's the guy who was behind
me
it's all right i don't even know about
your personal business it's breakfast
here
oh this isn't let's just talk for here
boys gentlemen there is a very serious
situation that you don't
know about because you don't remember it
this is our fourth time living may 9th
and i am very tired of this
the black pharaoh showed up and i'm
going to look straight at donnell as i
say that
oh no oh what does he want
you make a deal with him he wants us to
stop the damn time loop
yeah we have to stop around we
have to get the watch from the burster
i promise i will explain everything in
greater detail that part
i didn't i mean oh yeah that's right you
jumped to your death that's right i
if i could have done that i would have
done that but i was burnt to a crisp on
the ground
yeah okay let's let's let's let's back
up a few steps just
breathe joan what were they doing last
night
we missed something we didn't even get
the last night
we are stuck in a time loop the five of
us the three of us remember the two of
you do not
and we are trying to deal with it why
are the three of you
because we're constants joe jones a
constant
apparently not something that i knew
until
today but congratulations jim you poor
thing
i really i
because i that guy
the black pharaoh yes that's his name
well that's what we call him
he's one of the aspects and he's an
 and we hate him
but he he really enjoys the game
so he's helping us play it that's one
way to put the friday that's he has an
agenda but it's almost like
he wants you to help him get to his
agenda
or i don't know he's
he he he he can't play the game and keep
going over and over and over and over
he can't do anything i am not reliving
this day
over and over and over again what
happens to the state what's wrong with
this day
everything okay down down
well these eggs are pretty good so
they're not down drink some water
i haven't like killed anybody or
robbed what's the other commandments
that i have to i'm not going to sleep
with anybody's wife so now i forgot that
are you going to find a false idol
well obviously the black pharaoh thinks
he's a god i think he's a god
here here's his video um
there is a pocket watch that was
stolen from the count do you remember
the count from last night
he is very seriously ill right now and
it's because of a temporal instability
what is up what does that mean what is
that
it is a time he's he's
time is affecting him badly he's not
not even a little bit but i appreciate
the analogy
all right so we find this fella's
pockets watch what would they lose it
somewhere on the
on the blimp we just it was it was
stolen from him
by the bursar all right so then let's go
rough this burster up well hold on
emma do not encourage him give him um
he the the the burster and one of the
staff hare sisik is a
snake person in human disguise
and they can disappear yes so we we have
to catch this person by surprise
if we are to do what we do
effectively so you can light him on fire
but you really can't stab him
and he shoots electricity and he blew up
the blimp last time
so there's that why can't we why can't
alex stand him
he has this thing around him that's like
there's a shield
yeah but we can light them on fire yeah
liquid liquid
but here's the thing here's the problem
if you
get the watch and light them on fire the
blip blows up but we stop
time which means we don't get to do it
again does that make any sense
yeah and fix things
and have the blimp be on fire without
having another day to come back to
we can honestly can't fire it honestly
it honestly might be in our best
interest to pick the man's pocket
remember we had to call the burster to
get into the count's room
yes go what
oh so we call him and say we have an
emergency in the county room and then
he's there
and then we we just then he's there
and then he's there with all four
constants who are
on this blimp well we need to drug him
or knock him out put him asleep
right and then take it from him while
he's asleep
that is assuming he has it on him
assuming that that ether will affect him
the same way it does a human
yeah i don't have ether why not
what's wrong what kind of doctor i have
what about what about morphine morphine
works that works really well
again would that work on a snake person
yeah
it works very effectively on us
warm-blooded people because they have a
field i don't see how i'm going to
inject them with anything
um and they clearly didn't have that
field
activated because you were able to like
yeah yeah
i i i don't think that the field gets
activated until they feel threatened and
if we need to
by surprise and
[Music]
either or pick their pockets i have one
more question
um do they remember any of this that's
my question too i thought they said that
they remembered it
i don't know because he said i'll kill
you tomorrow or something like that
again you know i drink a little i'm
if we can get him to to let us into the
and then we have him there we have the
burster there we can
pick his pocket or something dr
hollister there
this this is one of the things that
delta green may not have prepared you
for
but a completely incoherent
conversation where i am
not filled in on anything that you're
saying and the things that you're
referencing i
know only the bare minimum about
all right it helps
uh the short version is that the three
of well the five of us have relived
this day
multiple times we are stuck in a time
loop
the three of us remember the two of you
do not because
of the multiverse idea of
of of the world where uh
there are there are infinite realities
and there is such a thing called a
constant
where then that exists in every version
of reality
emma is one i am one and apparently joan
is as well there's more
and so is count
and so is countless yeah
and the end and he is a constant
who is dealing with temporal instability
the watch that was stolen
from him helped keep him stable because
of
the theft he is unstable and that has
put us into this time loop where only
the constants remember what happened
i'm more interested at the end with the
two serpent men
who want the watch to go back to
wherever they came from that's what
they're supposedly stealing the watch to
use it for
yes and the ones that said that they
were going to kill us today
well they would see us again today i
think that they don't expect us to
remember
because they don't know that the three
of us are constants
[Music]
so we've got to be quiet we can't say
anything about talking about snakes
does that answer your questions dr
hollister does that help fill you in
somewhat um
i have to go
yeah you get to you have to go and and
and help the count
so you
tact is just out the window is the sense
that i'm getting i don't know how you're
going to pickpocket them
if they're actively aware of you and
planning to kill you
that is is the question i think
they were aware in that time loop that
we knew that something was going on but
if they don't think that we are
constants
that's an assumption it is but it's the
only one i can make
time to find out right
you might want to try to
break into the bursar's room if you
think it's in there
all right so here here here is what i
recommend then
i think that um
the count is ill he has he has a fever
and he is hallucinating he's mumbling
the word constant
and watch in german over and over again
that being the case you as a doctor will
be able to
help him and the burster can get you in
the door yes
help the count oh and then we go search
his room while he's doing all the other
you i'll tell him he doesn't appear at
breakfast and we're really worried about
him and we need to get in and find him
and this is a doctor
i can do this fun especially but he was
fine yesterday why are we so worried
because he didn't come to breakfast and
i was supposed to talk to him and stuff
he passed on breakfast you
joan joan danced with him last night so
so so you just maybe just dial it down a
little bit
yeah take a breath joan he was fine
yesterday
you're my friend and he's my friend joan
all right you can tell them
what what and what you told them
yesterday that that the count mentioned
to you last night that he wasn't feeling
well
when you parted after dancing yes and
then
and and then and then you went and
knocked on his door and he didn't answer
and you are concerned yes see i like
that
there are two different things being
said all right so
i know i i i unders i understand believe
me
i understand coming face to face with
all of this is
a lot but i need you i need you to hold
it together i know you can
that just despite that guy
at the end of the day the black pharaoh
is just one more man trying to tell you
you can't do
yes
he may he may think he's all powerful
and omniscient but he said we were
winning
that's what i keep coming back to he
said he couldn't believe that he that he
was
losing to us that surprised
me that's news to me
it was news wow believe me it was news
to me as well
all right but he said that we were
winning and that's
the important thing to hang on to right
now he can't tell you what to
he can't tell you what to do and he
can't with your mind joan
not your mind yeah
i got this i i can i can show that guy
now
let's go doctor go get him
all right so you two uh
will go and there's a
um
you get like a porter who a porter says
he can let you in
fantastic no we need but we we
don't want the cursor to be able to let
us go in i mean that we can't just go
into something you can let us go
in yeah we need the best of you madam
the
i can i can get the key the bursar is
not required for this if
it's a serious injury or something then
yes we'll probably want to let him know
but
uh i will go and get the key one
moment right all right
um yeah he'll come back with the key and
uh he'll let you guys in the
um the the count is
in a very bad way he is
he's weak he's dehydrated he's not even
tell the porter guy see i knew it i
could tell i could tell this
he needs help doctor is there
anything you can do
oh yeah regular success there are
some things we can try but he's
he's doing very badly oh dear oh yeah
um well perhaps
i should let the person know and if
you
if you will stay here i will be right
back
thank you he goes out
and as he goes out the burster enters
let's go and he he he looks at he looks
at joan
actually let's cut to you guys yeah uh
but yeah that's what we see
the door closes and the bursar is
is inside with you guys oh you're here
thanks for coming so you are what
gonna sneak through the kitchen
because the workers are behind the
kitchen then yeah we'll
we'll sneak to the kitchen all right um
it's just after breakfast uh
should be relatively quiet until until
the hour before lunch to start ramping
up
um i just rolled the 97 so the kitchen
is empty
cool so you um
you slide through the kitchen and um
you're in the hallway and um
very handily the doors are labeled
um and very handily most of the ranks
are the same in german
as they are in english um
you don't have to worry about over
lightning
uh you know oh no um
so lieutenant you find
the the bursar's room
uh and it is locked i'll i'll i'll just
like
like not even not even exchanging words
just turn around and keep watch as
donald starts picking up
28 success regular all right yeah you
very quickly
you're starting you feel like you've
opened these locks before
um there's just a click that is very
familiar to you
uh yeah you you
open the burster's door and
it is a small but neat room
um pretty tidy uh
and there's a you know there's a spare
uniform hanging up
uh there's a log book on the table
um sorry there's a bed and then there's
a small
desk and chair and a dresser and that's
it in this room let's start searching
yeah it's all spread out and searching
in sections of the room
yeah is it so it's me and donal is is
emma there with us
yeah yeah okay so the three of you are
in there
all right so yeah we'll we'll start
searching all right
um you hear a familiar voice sisik says
you won't find it whip around and look
at him
dagger already in hand i just keep
searching he's not in here
you don't see him just keep looking
do we see the wispy thing no
i'm gonna light a match and kind of go
around the room
you just start walking around the room
with a match um
the watch what what happened yesterday
i don't know what what happened
yesterday what happened
i thought i reset everything but
it didn't feel the same who who are you
this is this is hair cessac he's one of
the the crew members who is
oh all right right right you wish to see
what i am not really
who i am not really
so he is lying on the bed like this and
he
just goes and he peels it off
and like the cobra fold of his head
comes out he's like he's a there is a
human snake
in front of you donald make me a sanity
all of you make me a sanity right i've
seen this before
uh with mrs shiplay did shipley take it
off i don't think shipley ever took it
off yeah i failed
failed that role all right was it
missing shipley
yeah i'm fine yeah yeah okay
you lose four sanity which makes it bad
why don't
why don't we why don't we reroll that
donal
well buddy pal yeah i'll take a re-roll
if i got one
yeah let's do it at 20 was a big success
then
so all right yeah so everybody that made
a success loses one sanity
okay this trip is sucking i don't
understand why we just didn't stay in
we the choice was taken from us
we are eternal my people
came to this planet long before you
mammals what are you
i'm a serpent man you couldn't pronounce
my
true name so what happens if we cut some
kind of deal because
we both need the watch and i think that
we could help each other if perhaps we
help you
get whatever it is you need but we also
need to
get the watch back to the count in order
to get out of this time
loop we require the oculus
we require the watch but yeah i thought
you had it
that's why we're here yeah
but this time loop it's because there
are constants
because the count is so how
do we use the watch in our ceremony and
return it to him first respect
are we going all right when are you
going
to a time before you mammals walk the
earth
we play the long game our base of
operations
is several million years ago what
happened elf
and my commander were trapped here in
this
time right watch will get us out
well what happens if this world is
destroyed in one year's time
how does that work for your long game
seven months actually
no sorry we we don't wish to destroy the
this world
not you we're playing a bigger game you
say you're playing the long game we're
playing the universal game
do you know about this we're trying to
stop it
what do you know of nirella thoughtf oh
please don't say his name
there's like there's a couple of him
there's there he's a couple
there's more than a couple there's a lot
of him we are working as many aspects
they're all bad we are working to seal
away the aspects and stop what is about
to happen
they're all awake right now
and nylthotep wishes to end the world
the world is the world is going to end
you say that
that it felt like things were weird
in this reset
that's because the black pharaoh showed
up and put us to sleep and reset it
he wants to keep playing the game
hmm i feel like we're playing a
different game
yes but
button but regardless of which game
we're playing if
no there's something i must do he hits a
button
on his belt and there's a boop sound
and we cut to the burster
in your he comes in and he closes the
door and he
smiles a very an alarmingly toothy smile
he says how can i help you too
this man needs fluids
a towel if you can and
soup he's very sick i don't know if i
can get him to
he's not even responsive i'm gonna have
to like just drip like water into his
mouth
i see hmm
i've never seen anything i i have
well very well um
i shall go and i will have someone bring
you
uh soup and some towels and water here
do you require anything else i think
that would
not at the moment you have any other
doctors on the on the on the on the boat
that could uh
that could help because this is you know
this is bad
unfortunately you doctor are the only
room
that you are the only doctor that we
have on board
i we have some crewmen with rudimentary
uh medical training
could he could he have had food
poisoning or
some other kind of something oh what
could have happened to him
but it didn't need to look around this
was affected at breakfast
yeah we need to look
we need to we need to look and see maybe
maybe he maybe he has something in here
well i'm going to keep looking at him
and wait for the i'm going to
can i i'm going to look through his
things maybe he took something
that he should tell so you start looking
through his stuff the
person stands right behind you yeah very
close
and he says quietly in your ear what did
yesterday
what what did i do yesterday on the
ocean
i say today
i ate breakfast and then i came here to
to
help my friend your friends
will find my compatriot in my room
the watch is not there
they will be killed you
will be killed i
why why as you say why
there's a boop from his belt
perhaps you will excuse me apparently
you will not
die yet what and he
he goes to the door closes it and you
they're not bringing the towels
[Laughter]
um we cut back to the bursar's
room
uh if i had not pushed that button your
friends would be killed
we appreciate you pushing that button
so you wish to discuss some sort of deal
yes we we we need
we need the counts watch to be
returned so
that we can end this time loop and get
back to what we were doing
yes i think if you allow us to take the
count with us there will be no problem
that's fine with me what do you think
that's up to the count i mean i can't
make a deal for him
i don't know if he'll be lucid enough to
make a deal
well i don't think he has a choice
comes in and he like notes sisic
lying on his bunk yeah and
and at this point i'm perched like like
i have a hit perched up on on a desk or
something
we're all comfortable it's not like
we're feeling threatened at all we're
like
the count we must have the watch in our
presence
and we will let the the count will have
possession of the watch if that is what
ends
the temporal instability but he has to
go back with you
millions of years yes
well that's going to end well for him
but could you teach him the ceremony and
send him back
it's possible we could we could teach
him many things
i'm sure you don't really want another
human back in your time or place or
whatever it is
might be nice to get rid of him or send
him back here
well or we give him to the or we give
him to the migo
i don't know what that means they'll put
his brain in a jar and take it
to yageth he'll live forever as part of
their hive mind
i hear fascinating
is that something that can happen to a
constant
tip my head looking at him just really
interesting
one thing you learn when you travel
through time there are no constants
one thing you learn when you travel
i feel like we're playing different
and the one that we're playing ends uh
ends when this world does
in seven months
yes is there something that you people
can
do about that or help us in some way to
keep that from happening you consider
time as a linear concept we consider
time as a circle
you said the world ends in seven months
seven months is a meaningless concept to
me
the world will end when i am done with
it
and i will be done with it when the
world ends wow
if you are a miniable we can do this
right now
i don't see why not
i've got no objections it's fun of my
it's an entire universe wait against one
life
not not a choice i like making again i
cannot stress enough
the count will not die unless you feed
him too
into the things no the me go don't kill
you are quite alive in the jar you're
entirely cognizant
you are you gain the repository of all
of their boundless knowledge
that sounds like insanity in a jar
that's a little too much for me that's
it's just not a life i would personally
choose
um susic put your face back on will you
come with us
so they will you hear
youtube joan and savannah you hear a
click
back almost two characters ago
um it's your own fault nick you keep
trading
a click in the doorway and the
burster comes in
along with the crewman who has killed
you several times nick and who is
old you know the rest of you i don't
know what you're talking about
party oh sorry it's only killed you once
um and you um
you all come in and the bursar
pulls a watch a gold pocket watch
out of his pocket and lays it on the
count
and like almost immediately the count
like
there's almost like a super imposition
like he splits into like three and then
kind of comes back together
[Music]
i understand what he's got
um
would you would you mind switching to
english for those of us who don't speak
german sorry
i'm sorry this without this watch i
have uh
time sickness i could tell you were sick
i have i've lived i have lived
700 years yeah
we've got some good news and bad news
and at that point the bursar
and sisik will both step forward
and just say come with us and
their hands peel into like green claws
and each one takes a claw and touches
the watch
and then they both say three words in a
in a language that you
implode
what
there are stay in society dr allister
oh yeah hey dr holster make me a sanity
roll
yeah yeah it's amazing doesn't answer my
question
amazing things have happened here there
are
i mean what what do you mean what any of
it
any of it that you would like to explain
where we're we're out of the time loop
now
and and they took uh
him with them back hundreds of millions
of years ago
does emma have any alcohol with her oh
yeah they're not kidding it's like the
best
yeah drinking and passing yeah so
the good news is the rest of your
journey passes in an alcohol haze
i mean i i i i do want to try and and
and get back with the band
uh the bad news is there's there's some
uh
there's some consternation at three
people missing on the uh
on the zeppelin two crew members and a
passenger um
and you know uh
there is you know there are some
questions when you you land
in berlin but for the most part it is
an uneventful
