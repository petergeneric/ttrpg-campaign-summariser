we were at the bent and red pyramid
in da shore i i was gonna bring like
an ipad in to show you there
like the red pyramid is actually really
cool looking if you google it it
is it is the stone that they used
to make it is has a peculiar red
reddish tone to it and so it's very
different than the other pyramids
the big pyramid is just weird it's just
broken at the top it's just kind of
crooked at the top
um so you had all made it there
in various different ways um
dr hollister and don julio were under
the pyramids uh
hiking the whole way and avoiding uh
avoiding doles
or a dhole i guess and and and a duchess
yeah and a duchess the dhole was
actually
summoned by professor lamb who is now
in control for who knows how
long
of one of these beasts and
that beast
is now loping around the pyramids
crushing cultists
and alexandra and emma were
up on a rise with the innocence
that had been returned by bad guys and you
saw that and
alexandra started to sneak
up the back of the pyramid to get
to the top to
stop what she assumed was going to be a
a ritual 
when the dhole burst out of the ground
emma went a little a little emma
and started to just charge her way up
the pyramid
not quite as fast as
alexandra
emma is
about three quarters
of the way up the pyramid close enough
that you can see
uh the tip and you could see that there
were two
cultists at the top and
you see alexandra
stabs one of the cultists and he tumbles down
and then
you just kind of feel that the black
pharaoh is speaking through the pyramid
and alexandra you come up and there's a giant eye
where the capstone of the pyramid would
be looking around and as you
Donal is following alexandra with his scope
you see her get up to the top and stab the guy and then
she recoils physically
i think my concern would be if
something's holding her or stunning her
or whatever she's going to be sitting
duck for this other guy
because he doesn't realize what's going
on as far as at the top of that pyramid
so this is more of a danger than
whatever is happening
so i think i'll take a shot at the other
guy there.
so alexandra on the top of the
pyramid
uh you the the the eye says that thing
to you
and then it's it it you somehow
the eye like looks at the cultist and
says
you should duck now and the cultist
ducks and you
uh let's see professor lamb what um
what you have given your dhole the order
to
go around the edges of the pyramid
killing
uh just eating cultists right is that
and and that's the is that the only
for now i could see unless i see
something else
i'm going to tell it to go out go after
um
and and and i have to tell it what
cultists are or do i have to point at
specific ones or
well right now i mean i had to come up
and just go comp
detailed its understanding of you know
people on my side and people not on my
side is
so it's sort of eating anybody on the
ground that's why i wanted to get off
the ground as fast as i could
yes so far that's all i have for it
right now because
okay and i'm looking i'm looking for our
people if they're going out there and
i'll tell them not to basically make me
a power roll
we're more than 11 minutes in i can
swear now yes this
this is the oh god i haven't done this
for a while um
so i want your dice
um and alexandra both of you make me
luck rolls not those diversity from
who else is making a luck role emma oh
me
okay luck's not my scale
it really isn't what that's already a
let's also pick the right dice here yeah
that feels like two tens
um ooh oh
[Laughter]
you really took us on a journey there
amy it was actually a very emotional
journey for me
so i'm looking at a couple of zeroes
this is your second hundred and a half
in a span of a minute
well all right is there a bar at the top
of a pyramid
because i need to take a break all right
so um
so joan you in a
you know you find that you're kind of uh
directing this thing
and you find that like with gestures you
can sort of send it where
uh you want it to go but then you
realize that your gestures are not that
precise
and this
thing comes and it
hits the it it burrows through part of
the red pyramid and
uh oh and then
it comes up swallows him and then kind
of does the whale like
flop back down oh
oh okay all right i'm gonna push all my
uh spit that last one out spit the last
one out spit it out what do you have
there spit it out
all right boy down boy
dr hollister you and don julio
have been hiking for a very long time
you're both
very tired don julio is not a young man
um he knows it carrying him most of them
yeah you have been carrying him a good
ways
and don julio like all of a sudden
taps your shoulder
and and tells you to stop oh good
because he does that
through the sand almost as if the sand
doesn't exist
one of those giant worms comes
flopping down into this tunnel
and then you are face to face
what now already made a sanity roll the
sure okay don julio surprised me okay
with this
yeah i'm fine with it all right you hear
don julio
like he like he
he he goes he goes i
rebuke you oh good i was wondering when
we were gonna start
and as soon as he rebukes it
this thing's mouth which is about 60
percent of its entire being
its mouth opens and you hear a
[Music]
noise
and roaring towards you is a torrent
of some sort of awful brownish green
liquid
91 all right emma make me a swim roll
okay where's
i'm like where's the s's i remember your
swim skill being outstanding
oh no that's a nice just trying to get
out of the way no it's like sp
inspire that man yes
i've got standard swim i thought you had
a better swim than that that is a waste
is not outstanding i just nailed that
swim roll
yes i thought i thought you got more in
the swim because you nailed that first
one so you shouldn't just have the base
you checked off
that's been i don't think it's been
rolled that was shanghai because i have
swim i have climb i have a bunch of
stuff that needs to like go
you didn't you didn't do it after that
yeah did you not do your skill checks
i don't know i did i don't know that's
why i met like
97 with my knife
so i mean anyway it was an incredible
now you did roll like an odd one on the
other swim roll but yeah i did
so you did not make this are you going
to inspire this
do we try i mean there's only chance of
libras arcana
going worse how how about you use them
birds of paradise that i know you have
close to hand
your swim roll is 20 right yeah yeah
don't uh
yeah we don't have a lot of inspiration
and we're gonna not die at other times
yeah whose fault is that whoa
wow wow okay so
wow uh
we love and appreciate every all of our
viewers
most of our viewers all of our viewers i
mean not rachel but otherwise
even even j matthew who
who keeps betraying us we still love you
mr jay matthews is the only i mean
i have to say to us not you
wherever she may be um
uh so you are not nope
okay i'm not apparently i'm not going to
inspire my swim roll i'm just going to
get barfed out apparently that is indeed
true
uh let's see did any of the other guys
too so you seem to be underground
in a fairly dark uh
uh tunnel there's a light source ahead
of you
and as you are like drowning in
um intestinal fluid which is highly
acidic not fun
um you think you see don julio
and and is that dr hollister splash
um can i just ride right past them in a
like a barf
like in a barf blood
a barf wave in a barf flood i noticed
her slide by
i'm gonna ask don julio if that was what
oh it could it could well be son like
the worm does that vomiting thing and
then it just starts
it it in a very uh
a droid maneuver it kind of just makes a
quick turn
kind of back the way you came
um so emma you take
four points of damage uh
from being partly eaten by a worm
from being partly swallowed by a worm is
it a digestive
projectile part or is it the bed
well um
can i put don julio down along the side
where there's not as much
intestinal fluid and use some of the
water to try and wash the acidic fluid
off of emma and like get her like rinse
out her mouth and everything basically
do a first aid roll
sure i'm just standing there like this
like
just goo dripping okay so yeah i rolled
oh
it's just a hard success on the first
aid all right a hard success though so
you get a
you get three points back okay
i don't have goo in my eyes anymore
that's right you you washed her out
pretty well
um and don julio will uh
will come up to you emma and he will
say
um i have been
called here i just slap him
i just i'm like i don't want to hear it
from you i just got barfed
out i will i will intercept that give me
a chance to
all right make me a this is an
opposed fight brawl role
oh you better i got good fight brawl my
friend i am very flattered
and i did not make it but it wasn't too
bad
35. hang on let me see let me find my
let me find my dice first
fight brawl where are you where are you
my friends
get you anything and fight wow also
didn't make it
all right so dr hollister you
you reach in to try and catch her wrist
because she's gonna slap
but she's too fast for you but don julio
just
lightning quick just reaches up and
grabs your wrist
and and he says you are not
who i am here to rebuke there is a
greater evil than you here
we've had a long trip yeah that's true
i'm just like all right we cut back to
the top of the pyramid
uh alexandra donald
you have just seen this worm
swallow emma and take part of the red
pyramid off
actually you know what i like it better
it it passes through the pyramid ooh
and it just grab it just swallows him up
and then like flops back down
into the sand yeah i'll like scream
emma's name at the top of my voice
because
i mean all stealth is gone at this point
there's a giant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] worm
there's no there's no stealth anymore
when when you scream emma the pyramid
says to you
well that's who i thought was coming i
just looked at it and go
so at that point the pyramid starts to
distend
and the i starts to
um emerge from the pyramid
and all of the sudden standing at the
tip of the pyramid
about eight feet tall astride the
pyramid
is the black pharaoh donald you see
come out of there and
the pharaoh has
of well he has these two
rods in his hand that look sort of
familiar
they look like the ones that joan used
um so i think
well actually so joan donnell
and alexandra we're gonna start with
joan arbitrarily here so you um
you saw the worm swallow emma
and you told it to throw it up and you
are aware
that it has thrown emma up you're not
but i know okay so i know she's out so
that's good
the i'm gonna bring tell the the dhole to
come back
and i'm gonna have it let's see if they
can jump over the pyramid and grab
oh okay right the other person on top of
the pyramid is not sure about this
okay you can't fumble twice go for it
yes you can those are famous last words
more air time it has the less time it's
is hard all right outstanding um
donald what are you doing there's not
much i can do
i'm not shooting this guy it's pointless
to shoot him alexander's right there and
i basically i'm thinking about just
lowering the rifle slightly and looking
at joan and like just hoping that jones
gets this right
okay that is a perfectly acceptable
response to this
uh alexandra does the pharaoh
that's a stupid question he's he's he's
corporeal but not but i can't stab him
and that
stabbing won't solve anything at this
point oh there's an episode title
um i mean i have daggers in my hand but
i'm going to back off a step
and like put a flip not many steps to
back off just so you're
well i'm i'm going down down like a
layer of uh
of of of the pyramid like starting to
edge my way off of the pyramid
very carefully because i i mean i just
climbed the thing i know how steep it is
okay um
all right so joan you yes
um this worm is free willying it and
comes
leaping out of the sand um
you emma and hollister there is
like an
earthquake around you
as you can you can actually see where
this thing
there's light coming out where moonlight
is coming out where this thing created
an incline tunnel essentially
um start that ritual soon
and it launches into the air
and it is making a perfect byline for
the black
pharah and the black pharaoh holds up
one of the rods
the best the best description you like
in your head joan
you think the word it's like someone put
a worm in a band saw
because this worm just splits in half
all the way down the length of it
that's actually a title worm and a
bandsaw worm in a bandsaw
um my body and uh
uh and yes the worm is quite dead
and doesn't even look he just like holds
up the rod
and carves this thing wormy no
my buddy and
don't don't don't recommend it too much
or not enough too many
no
there is exactly there's exactly one
person in any existence that i'll marry
i think you're thinking of mary in too
much of a
conventional human sense well i am a
conventional human that is literally the
only way that i can think of things
really what this involves is your
component essence
merging with mine and adding
that final element of finite humanity
that i require
to be astride the earth you
will be you will have the honor of
taking that
faithless night of chris's place and
your heart
god
no
um i i don't understand where you
i may not have a great deal of choice
but i will not go quietly into that good
night
there's the lounge i was waiting for
you can come with me peacefully
but first and he gestures at half of the
worm that is now lying on the ground
twitching
i know what you're here to do you think
i don't know when a capstone
i've already won the game that's what
that's what you oh that's what you've
never understood
this game is a one player game
i am the only one playing this game
then why do you bother with us
my favorite game is one i always win
really don't you enjoy the challenge
don't you enjoy the thought that maybe
you might lose that's what makes games
you you know you know in the very
essence of your being you know that this
is inevitable
i grant you that you and
your friends might
possibly be successful for a minute
there's a chance that you actually
install this capstone
that you use you
kill innocent people
to seal this pyramid
because you know you know in your heart
of hearts
i've only left you enough innocent
people that you have to kill them to
complete this ritual
you're talking to the wrong person to
guilt oh that's not
guilt i love i
unfortunately nidochrist is beyond
but you might be successful
this time as a matter of fact
you've been so you constance
have been successful seven times in a
row now
but i am inevitable again and again
every 597
and the game is played again that's what
you don't understand about humans
even if we know that eventually you'll
come back
even if we know that eventually all it
takes is once all it takes is losing
once
we will keep fighting until it's too
late
that's humanity we fight even when we
know we're going to lose
we climb a mountain because it's there
and we
and we stand against the darkness
because there's no other option
in my experience you simpletons climb a
mountain because someone more powerful
tells you to well then you don't have a
very broad experience do you
people go and explore because they want
to know what's out there
i am a turtle i conquered this land i am
conquering this land again
hey well emma was the one that you
expected you must have expected some
kind of
well yes
i see it's going to be the hard way then
is this where you draw your knives
they're already in my hands you idiot
in your hands are two snakes
i look down at them and then just toss
them aside don't even react
because the moment he said that i
this is my place this is my
power and people have stopped you
in your place in your power seven times
you have yet to win i have yet to try
well mike what makes us so special why
has he has a different
cycle than i do and he
is less he's less accepting
of the game than i am
and
you say that as if i understand what
and it is time for azathoth
maybe
but it won't be easy we won't make it
uh so all of a sudden the rest of you
here
in your heads the voice of the black
pharaoh
uh
alexandra and i will await you
in the wedding chamber below the pyramid
please bring gifts and don't be late
and donald you have been you know you
like put your scope back up watching
what was going on
yeah and you see the pharaoh
and alexandra both distend and go
through
the top of the pyramid into the pyramid
oh christ joan
john they're inside the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pyramid
what they're inside
god i'm come with me we're running
all right i gotta tell the dhole to stay
away i know it's dead it's dead it's
just dead
there's yeah there's a lot of go there's
a lot of dhole innards
about the time that hollister emma and
don julio are coming out of
the the upward tunnel
yes i was successful
outstanding yes well i have to
acknowledge that
do we make meet those the rest of
what now we meet up with the group yeah
yeah they're you're all together
so are isn't the ritual supposed to
happen
at the top of the pyramid we don't have
to go
do what he says we should go to the top
and do that
well inside this pyramid he's got some
sort of chamber inside there i see a
bridal chamber or something to that
effect he's taking
alexandria inside and the ritual is
actually tomorrow
right we can't but the the ritual to
to purge the evil how how close do you
need to be for that
i'm it's it's worked in the industry
it seemed to work on someone that was
so if we bring him to the door can you
we can
preoccupy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chant
well listen what what are we doing right
now what are we doing
i am preparing the ultimate exorcism
excellent all right they're inside the
pyramid let's go inside i know emma
you've been inside this pyramid before

there's rooms inside here hidden
passages yeah you just go in the door
we need to rescue alexandria so we're
gonna rescue alexandra

just bring him with us hold on
let's just back up remember the plan was
we have another plan right now we get
like before tonight he turns her into
neither chris or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's
doing
donald trump that's the plan yeah guys
we all have to be in the same page here
or we're not going to get it
uh he he seems to think that it would
work better
centrally inside the pyramid perfect
then let's all go because we gotta go
get alexandra
all right we're there we're on the same
page now donald let's go comes out
and joan you have the capstone right
we're yes ready to go and we've got the
people with us
no but i don't think people can't do it
okay can't do it the ritual until
tomorrow night that's a different
different direction yeah yes yeah this
so tonight is the ritual to cleanse this
area of evil
tomorrow is the ritual to install the
capstone right but
everything with us this is still the
night of the fourth isn't it
that's right he got there at midnight i
think it's the morning of the 5th
yeah this is now like the morning of the
i'm like great what month is it may june
um so yeah you um
you guys will come in and yes emma you
remember
this pyramid and you like are able to
like find the hidden door
that leads you into the undiscovered
parts of the pyramid and i'm going to
point out be like that's the map with
all the other capstone places and i'm
like and that's the place where the
guy's wearing the skirt and he's walking
like this yeah
like just giving my like an
yes she's really pointing out the
highlights of
this this beautiful space and um
i'm looking for a familiar
hieroglyphs they yeah these seem very
similar to what you were seeing
in the in the sphinx as in
they're inky and yes oh
oh no no no no no no no i i tried trying
to wipe them
okay joan get to get rid of these
they eat fresh they're fresh you're
fresh
so so yeah donal and emma
uh hollister and jones start like
scrubbing the walls
that's really the time to be cleaning
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah things will come out
yes yes these are ritual signs for bad
things let's get rid of them
yeah put it in the entire interior right
see these dark dark dark they've been
they've been done recently
so that means that somebody's been
in here preparing monsters yes they're
preparing to summon monsters
so now doctor and i
are going to wash it down don julie
like when you say monsters don julio
there will be monsters but not here why
aren't you helping
because i want them to come not
okay okay let's get rid of some of them
let's get rid of some of them right
now and i'm i'm yeah you guys will mark
out a bunch of them
you will and i'm gonna push don julio
for don julio forward a little bit i'll
just be like okay old man we're going to
the big evil to get i'll get you the big
evil
uh i'll get you to the people i keep
lecturing as if to children
about how we are going to make sure that
there aren't
too many of these monsters we know about
this let's fix it
so just just stop mentioning monsters
don julio gets all wound up
boosters yeah they're in the big room
over there let's keep going
speaking of which gave us 500 bids to
crash a wedding
oh nice would you say demons
see and he's got a bad attitude too
you're gonna love this guy yes the
prince of i the prince of darkness is no
wait the prince of darkness is known for
his persuasiveness
yeah he does that too he gives you
ultimatums like come with me or
everybody's gonna die
it is i think it's time for a pillar of
salt
okay i think i've got a packet with the
what do you roll for religion um
she's got a skill in it well here's the
thing i rolled a d20 so i don't know
right now
i have a wrong system wrong system
that
sure so birds of paradise the zero is a
zero the tens is a zero
yes i'm totally confused okay so i got
an eight so it's like an extreme success
so i mean yeah you know pillars of salt
sodom and gomorrah
don't look at it well but also like you
know
that seems to be something that that
your god has given
the ability to do on a large scale
from time to time yep
which means we need to gtfo okay so i i
completely understand yeah i think about
it like going into sodom and gomorrah
with the
alexandra and the black pharaoh got it
except that we have to
grab her and run and don't look back
that's the moral of the story here
people that's a lot
i will purify this location
your your compatriot here has told me
some of your
of what you're doing and i will purify
this location nothing will be left here
for what you need to do tomorrow
jesus christ thank you he
will be the driving force of all of this
jesus name amen
the father the son the holy ghost they
are all
okay buddy i pat him on the back and
just turn him back in the right
direction but okay buddy let's go
you are a terrible nun yeah i know
wow is that emma's not a nun i feel like
you need
my part of the quote for the second part
of the quote that's a great
oh for goodness sake break your rule
this time
that is a gray area that's a good one
you are a terrible nun i know
where i'm like where have you been like
the last like year
um all right yeah so you continue on
um and you you make it
into a massive open chamber
where you have emma you have been
before
alexander make me a
come on i think chris 15.
all right so um
you you have when he sucks you into the
pyramid
you are in a chamber and in this chamber
are three um
i mean they look like they stepped out
of the
egyptian museum's exhibits there are
three women wearing very old looking
dress
with their their hair styles are like
you know most of their tonsured
basically
um and they are um
they are somehow you know that
these are your handmaidens who are
preparing you for your wedding
you're still entirely who you are
mm-hmm and but you're you're aware of
being alexander and all this stuff
but you're also you're also
okay so i'm two people at once or i'm
am i able to push back against this you
can push back
yeah no i'm gonna be like you're already
two people at once
you're not wrong um
yes so yeah you um
um they so yeah you you like the
first thing that happens is
one of them in a language that you
don't understand but understand
um brings you uh
and i just like swatted out of their
hands right yeah you do that
and and she just she kind of just
goes
and i just like glare back at her very
much
i may not i may not be able to do that
anything with daggers at this point but
i'm also not going
do you wish assistance with your
vestments
when you say that you look down and you
are wearing not what you were wearing
you're wearing like a flowing white gown
oh gods
um do i see any indication of what they
want to put me into
it looks like it's mainly jewelry and
some sort
of scarab based
given the choice i'll stay i'll stay in
the white gown because at least
then i'm not worried about a scarab
chest plate coming to life and trying to
eat me
okay i am not asking for a headdress
nick
uh there was not a headdress on the uh
uh on the list um
and so yeah you are in this chamber
um and these these handmaidens are
like
sort of cooing over everything and
they're like
if you whatever they will do whatever
you allow them to do like they're trying
to do your hair
they'll try and you know they'll try
and um
[Music]
perfume you with this pungent spicy
uh scent i'll let them do my hair but
anything that involves something that i
think might soak through my skin and try
to make me more pliant
i won't allow okay oh no no makeup no
perfumes no drinking anything not even
washing my hands
yeah and and they you know they
they exc you know they go they do
exactly what you allow them to do
and nothing more all right so
uh you have so you four
have burst out with don julio into the
middle
of this large chamber and
in this chamber sitting sort of idly
on a massive black throne is the black
pharaoh
uh and
this chamber is full of
not just cultists there are also uh
figures that hollister and lamb
recognize that are those
those beast men that came out of the
wall
there he is don julio get him
this this is the place you should all
are you as much time as you i would say
can we all spot hidden for
alexandria is she you do not see her in
this room
okay do i know of any other like are
there any other rooms that i've
been in because i know i was born and
i've gone to the universe
right this is as far as you've come and
when she says gone to the universe
um you all realize that there's no roof
to this place there are just stars
you can't make me realize that
[Laughter]
you can't make me think that god
planetarium has been invented yet if not
joan has an idea yeah it's an awesome
room
uh we can't find alexandria though we've
got she's in here somewhere spread out
anybody anybody with astronomy will
realize some very disquieting things
about this room
what are the numbers in front of us what
are we looking at
uh tens
of tens of cultists and
probably a dozen of those beast men
right and they're just they're they're
not paying you any attention
so in this room huge massive room
statues along all the walls all the
statues are of the black pharaoh
um and they
all these cultists and these things are
lined up on the floor genuflecting
and not chanting or anything but just
genuflecting to the black pharaoh
so i just look at donald and i push him
one way and i go the other and i start
running around the outside of the room
looking for
a door i'm gonna stay with you as long
as i can to protect you while you
perform the ritual
all right i'll start searching as well
for randomly so hollister when you say
that don julio says
i should begin now yes
i'm going to turn everything
in this place that has any sin
are you a sinless man
dr hollister what if we stand behind you
well we just have to avert our eyes
right is that how none of us
are without sin i'm at peace
if we wait i can't guarantee that you'll
live long enough to do it
and you you performing the ritual
very well emma and i are already out of
there right
yeah you're both running around the
sides yeah hollister start
sorry hollister don julio starts to
pray
and he is he is um
he is praying it starts in english and
quickly moves into spanish and then
latin
um and this doesn't seem to be
um this doesn't seem to be like a ritual
that he's memorized
this is like a beseeching he is begging
the lord his god i'm gonna do i'm gonna
do a quick
prayer myself to jesus for forgiveness
of my sins
just to see if that buys me some time
and i'm i'm focused on him and i'm
trying to see if i can
get anything from it i have some latin
so i'm like
trying to see if i can so make me a
latin roll
but i've got my gun out and i'm looking
for anything to approach don julio to
stop it
nah i didn't get it all right as far
as you can tell joan
he is literally just begging god
to to to release
all sinners in this like there's again
this is not
like a ritual this is not like you
understand something about ritual magic
right it does not seem to be that this
is like um
this is like when i was a kid and i
would like pray to get what i wanted on
my birthday
you know and i thought i could get out
of trouble that was my
if i thought if i prayed really hard it
would actually happen that's
that's almost what seems to be happening
here okay all right
i can i can i can i can sympathize with
that
um all right is there anything i can do
to help him is there anything that i
have
is there anything that we can draw i've
got the
the ink soaked rag from
i mean so he is like he has stopped
paying attention to you and he is just
praying we should draw something around
us
that they can't get through maybe can we
look while this is going on
yeah you're doing that you're man i i
don't know i hand i hand the rag to you
then i mean you could you can sort of
remember the elder sign stuff you could
try drawing an elder sign
yeah yeah that's what i'm going to try
to do this is this is my this is what
i'm going to try to do is try
to give us some some some resist
and do you do you have the you have the
ritual create a
craft elder sign right yeah yeah
all right so yeah you can start to put
that out there
um so normally when you've done this
it's taken a very long time
but there's a lot of other people around
so i can probably get some of their
oh outstanding yeah you have a history
of sucking uh
energy from other people that that is
that is totally yeah
this is what we saved the inspiration
for yeah oh
yes uh
just just not not quite er not quite uh
i got 15. i needed 11. but okay so
that's a hard success or right yes
yes yes yes yes sorry yes hard success
um so
yeah you you start to
um yeah you draw energy
from everyone around you dr hollister
emma and donald make me power rolls
there's no way i can say not them
can't focus on a group and go like them
inspiration
yeah yeah do we need to should we yeah
okay so let's you and i but so hollister
and emma roll again
okay hard success this time no
still still the all right emma you
have a familiar like woozy feeling
okay that you felt before and you're
gonna have a penalty die
on everything that you do damn it
okay but on the plus side
with a with a hard success professor
lamb you have crafted
a a a reasonable
uh and you feel like reasonably
protective elder sign
nope so um
he just keeps doing what he's doing uh
all right donal
and emma
you yeah do i
how far have i gotten because i'm having
thoughts haven't you're about
a third of the way around you both split
off you're about a
third of the way around the room um
and no one is paying you any attention
at all
um there's nothing here is there
you're still searching i don't know you
have not no i mean like
i i haven't found anything so and i look
down the rest of the hall there's
nothing there
i'm searching you don't see any doors
my eyes lock on the black pharaoh and i
just charge for him
oh nice okay yeah
uh donald you you see emma
like you're sort of going around the
edge of the room
and you see her cut to the middle of the
room and just charge down
this open avenue amongst all of the
people who are ignoring her as they are
are genuflecting
and she's just like charging forward yep
i'm yelling give her back and emma
make me
oh no i'm not gonna make it without a
penalty die what makes you think i'd
make it
birds of paradise confuse me which one
is the which one so that would be a
50 or a 20. so both of them
kind of don't really entirely right yet
so i'm going to make you an offer then
mm-hmm oh god you i'll just follow my
face that's fine
as you as you charge up this avenue
in your head you hear
uh oh god what was his name i don't
remember his name but you hear the voice
and he says and in in your head
he says the sword is yours if you pay
that's a pharaoh killing sword i know
and i'm gonna say yes i don't know what
the price is anymore because i'm
i don't know what the i was gonna say
you need a drink from your flask so you
can use drunken sword fighting
yeah all right yeah so
um donald on the list of weirdest things
you've ever seen
emma is just tearing down this thing and
all of a sudden she reaches over her
shoulder
and draws this gleaming center
okay imagine if you could never get
drunk again
is completely flabbergasted hang on
thomas get me my sword oh hold on hold
please
please hold i'm gonna say it's just over
there because
you know because you're scared no it's
over there thomas how many marriages do
you know that you can yell into the
other room
honey could you get me my sword i am in
the sca
i know a lot of people who can yell
exactly that and get it and get a sword
in their hands
thank you thank you my name is there it
is
has returned oh
man and so yeah you are just charging
with the sword of Akmala
held high um
and uh
uh so donald you're just are you gonna
continue moving are you
[Music]
i don't i think i'm gonna stay i'm gonna
watch this i got nothing on this
yeah so donald just stops
man what does an elder sign do to
prayers to
a catholic god nothing it's just that
it's just a way to keep us safe
so it's protection it protects i mean i
mean it's pure good
so so what's it gonna do if he's asking
them to turn it into a pillar of salt
that's what i want you won't turn into
anyone in this sign won't be turned into
it's definitely one thing that could
happen
i'm gonna stand inside the other side
um yeah hollister and lamb are like
we're in here nothing works
all right so the black pharaoh
stop and you stop
i will make you an offer you defeat my
i'll make you a better offer you def i
defeat
you defeat your you defeat your champion
and
you bring alexandria back oh
you've met my champion and in front of
do does she look like the real
alexandria what is she
so yeah so alexandra you are in front of
emma
where and wearing this flowing white
gown you have your knives out
um you this feels exactly like the
ancient rome thing
so you can like i said you can
try and fight it but
your compunction is to
huh probably compulsion that's a bit
okay
i mean i'm gonna fight it it's emma
we've gone through universes together
very literally
so nothing is is there a fold-up chair
in this room
if anyone if anyone tries to break my
so i lowered the sword down to my side
and i'm like let's go
come on come on come on let's go let's
go let's go don julio's gonna turn
everybody into fire and brimstone let's
go
we gotta go alexandra let's go
alexander make me a power roll
come on 21 hard success
all right yeah you you start to you can
you start down the aisle
yeah i'm i'm like holding my daggers
away from my sides and
back as much as i can to keep them away
from emma
and follow along how long do you think
you can resist
the urge to plunge your knife
all you have to do is kill emma
and you are mine and that compulsion
will remain
in you for the rest of days have your
little priest
turn all these fools into salt i will
wait
another 597 years watching you
every single day try not to
kill your friend and i will
enjoy it so i point my sword at him and
just be like do you watch us in the
shower
[Laughter]
am i able to am i able to answer or am i
locked in myself
yeah and i will fight you every god
damned day
[Laughter]
uh emma all you have to do is defeat my
champion
i'll i'll i'll look at emma and like
push my hands as
i know i'm fighting myself on this but
pushing my hands out a little bit and be
like
come on i know come on come on backwards
come on i just keep like i keep doing
the here puppy
come on come on and like walking
backward one step at a time like come on
are you trying to make her roll at this
advantage on her power rolls what are
you doing
[Laughter]
emma if you emma if you knock me out it
yeah but here's the so
i'm running over to emma i'm running
over to emma right now yeah you're over
there with them
and i say don't know my eyes just get
here's a pistol here's the back of the
pistol
well i mean i can knock her out with the
back of my sword
but i can't knock her out with the back
all right how about i want to try
something so i'll step i want to step
forward to
the black pharaoh and say there's rules
right
there's rules of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game says
the deal breaker
don't want to talk about rules let's
discuss that shall we
we made a deal a bargain between the two
of us correct
more than 30 days ago yes
and my part was give you the address of
ours
not done and there sucks there's no deal
the deal is broken that's not how that
works that's how it works fella that's
the rules
you get her back have her back bring her
back do your thing the deal is off
bring nida chris back that's right is
that all
right right now
if you said you couldn't you liar
i said i couldn't without you
i can bring nitacris back right
fine so i take the i turn my sword
around and my hands are bleeding and i'm
like
i'm sorry no you oh god that's that
wait so you're using it like a baseball
bat
a person who actually knows how to use a
sword is just cringing over here man
yes okay um
i mean that is the equivalent of rolling
with disadvantage right
wow so
you know you could just like do that and
with the hilt yeah
yeah getting that close to the lady with
the pointy things
as hollister that's almost as bad as
dagger lady i hope you know
that it's pretty much right there i'm
not getting that close to dagger lady
i'll cover you so my god
dawn julio hurry up i can't watch this
anymore
all right so emma you
in an incredibly bad idea grasp the
spectral sword of Akmala
and you bring it over and you clock
uh alexandra and alexander
you collapse to the ground and
um
and the pharaoh the pharaoh just
keeps looking
at donal pick her up
uh all right you pick her up and you
know
um i'd like to apologize to our more
sensitive users for what i'm about to
say
but you know every curve on this woman's
body
this is not alexandra
and when you turn her around let's see
if i have the picture here
uh you are knight across now alexandra
you are still in your head you are still
alexandra
but in your body and in your memories
in everything you are knight of chris
huh so are there two of me in this in
this in his head at this point
no no there's not there's not two of you
you are
you have all of your emma emma you
have all of your alexandra
in memories you've just been physically
transformed
into night we may have to go to break
soon thomas is getting a second piece of
ice cream cake
break him break him in half when and and
when you come back up
uh the black pharaoh says this has never
happened with a constant before
how interesting i consider our deal
complete
donal i've brought nidachris back
you don't owe me a headdress anymore
i'll i'll take whoever this is with me i
think it's alex i don't know
i'm confused i'm just going to take her
out of here i don't know yeah let's go
so i point my sword
at the black pharaoh and i'm like let's
get out of here start yeah he's
he's just sort of bemusedly watching you
go
um and you get up to you get up to the
um you get up to the elder side
uh just as and don like as you get to
the elder side
don julio looks up scared
and he just says you should have run and
that's when we'll go to break so that
amy can get some ice cream cake
yeah so don't forget we are giving away
a copy of those lollipop dice
so it's hashtag chaos uh
right now to be entered to win those
uh those lovely lollipop dice which
you know again probably should be called
cotton candy uh
or pink lemonade you know
[Music]
maybe it's like pink crystal light that
weird like
crystalline thing in there so
we will be back just as soon as five of
us can use the bath
five bathrooms and amy can eat a piece
of ice cream cake
[Music]
welcome back internet friends um
at the break we had our we're gonna have
our drawing to see who wins
the the lollipop dice uh
emma if you wanna crank up the squirrels
on treadmills that run this thing and
yeah yeah
congratulations yep that's great so yeah
beautiful nice if you will whisper your
contact information to quests and chaos
they will uh
get those in the mail to you just as
soon as the us postal service functions
again
actually i think what it's fine
everything's fine
but it's just when thomas actually
goes to the post office
that's more like it so
i don't like to retcon things and we're
not gonna retcon this
but during uh
at the end of that whole thing tiana
you
you asked a question and i i i really
want it to be your choice so you asked
if if it's sort of if there are two
of you if kind of nida chris
and you are in there and that sort of
thing or if it's just a
a total physical transformation with
your mind
um and and i want it to be your choice
so
i mean i'm a sucker for for for for the
story so
i think it's gonna have to be uh
nightigrass
and me in in the same head okay
all right so yeah interesting
so so yeah you are
you're fully aware of um
what's going on and as you start to
move
you move differently your body is moving
differently
um and you are um
like it's clear that your your physical
abilities are different
you're also a near six foot black woman
oh god
i'm so tall i shot up a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
foot hey i noticed that difference a
stunningly beautiful
uh six foot tall black woman
i just mm-hmm i had the the npc sheet
around here somewhere

hers your mental abilities so far seem
to be yours
okay let me so how does that

your strength is 60 yes

the same okay your appearance is 90.
wow your pal is the same but put in
parentheses next to it 80.

i beg your pardon you've got a clive
inside your head now
you don't be talking about clive
1d4
dear
okay do i retain my knife abilities
does like the rest of my skills stay the
same
physical skills are gonna be impacted
come on i worked really hard for this
you know she's got to be good at
something else
you'll learn you'll learn again you have
to just learn how long your arm is again
and stuff yeah
yes that is a big part of it like you're
now swinging from a lot farther out a
lot
taller up you do feel
as if somewhere
in your head there is all sorts of crazy
forbidden knowledge
oh we're going to be talking
[Music]
so am i being carried out or am i being
ushered out at this point
ushering you out i thought i'm carrying
all right
i'm six foot tall that's hard now
uh so you guys get uh
as i said you get up to um
where uh
where don julio is you should have run
we're going man we're going and all of a
sudden his mouth opens
and white light pours out of his mouth
okay avert my eyes yeah he's always open
i know the story
we're booking so you're leaving wait
wait are we going to stay in the we're
going to stay in here right now this is
the elder side right now we're we're
closing our eyes
yeah so are you leaving the pyramid or
not
i don't think we can with our eyes
closed
do we you have to you have to run you
have you can't look back
if we run and don't look back that's
what the bible says
all right i'll trust emma on this we
gotta leave whatever emma does well yeah
but the sign yes
i'm following emma i'll all right so
harry alex or whoever this is
emma says get out of here okay
julio says get out of here let's go it's
true don julio well actually
um don julio's statement was fully in
the past
tense yeah just you know
just to add that little i'm seeing
myself running out of a burning building
as it blows up behind me like
like i'm in an action movie in my own
head yeah let's let's go yeah uh
tiana also oh
next to your cthulhu mythos oh no
okay whoa speak egyptian
in parentheses 60 talk like an egyptian
occult in parentheses 97 oh
hang on 97
yep oh okay
and the languages will will
just will finagle but you you feel like
you understand
languages that you didn't understand
before okay
or it's almost like you're hearing
translation
you know so i hear i hear like an echo
maybe of of like
the translation over what's being said
yeah like there's like
a translator in my ear that's a great
way to put it all right so
um okay emma says run is anybody not
running
go run i think i'm hesitating i'm
looking at joan
we're both kind of going we've got this
we've got this how does
how does the elder sign look is it like
lit is it is it is it clearly magically
it is not glowing like the other ones
yeah so it's not as powerful we're going
i'm okay all right so
um so you all run
is busting out of here is anyone
looking back
not a chance in hell i know the stories
i know the stories
all right you will make it out of the
pyramid
um there is
um there's all sorts of rumbling
there is wait all right when you
get back what
so you you have exited the pyramid what
are you doing now
just keep moving still running right
where are you where are you are you
running to the camp where your innocent
people are
are you running camp we need to go back
to camp guys
right right yep at some point at some
point i need to look at
it who is with me because i'm not i'm
i'm just
i've been so distracted i don't even
know something alex is different
right yeah so once you once you get when
you when you get to a place where you
settle down that will hit you
when you stop like just fleeing yeah
everyone who is a devout catholic needs
to make me a pale role
what is am i still disadvantaged or
whatever
why does it have to be catholic what
about christians
i mean i mean alexandria is a former
catholic but i mean
oh trust me there are many reasons why
you're not rolling this alexandria
um sure donald go ahead and roll
that's that's an interesting twist if
you're actually i got a 12.
all right so what what so but what
about like a moderate yet
reinvigorate christian free
protestant a pentecostal perhaps yeah uh
uh
are you i mean unless you're catholic
this is not going okay
all right so
donald and emma hear
um
hear like a keening whale you hear
like a voice
in some sort of language
you're feeling it more than anything
else and um
basically i mean you are hearing
the voice of the divine and it is
terrifying this is old testament like
you know fire and brimstone
i'm gonna tell you to kill your son and
then when you do it i'm gonna blame you
for it
uh god
i'm running i'm running even faster at
this point like i know i know it's
working
um so you get up to your
little camp and
i don't know so i'm gonna do do i know
that there's people there
uh no you don't i mean you
you sort of remember that i mean you you
you remember that there were innocents
you know the folks you brought i'm gonna
shout for them to avert their eyes
so when you come up and and dr hollister
you are
for dramatic purposes the first one over
the rise
there is a line of 12
people standing in a row and where their
eyes were is white light
oh and they all say
in one voice fear me and
uh yeah so and the rest of you come over
the rise
and you see you see dr halster like
he has physically like done
this as as he sees them and you all
heard
and it was that it was almost um
when you were back in the warehouse and
they were speaking in like the greek
chorus thing
there was like a weird dronie thing to
their voice
this is bells when they speak
all together it is like the tin tin
abulation
that is a great word so i just go
straight fetal cover my eyes cover my
head just go into like
the little ball all right honestly
honestly i'm not far behind her just
like nope
all right part of you alexandra
doesn't understand what the hell is
going on
and i'm gonna push back against that
part and be like just do what it says
oh god i wanna i wanna see them i want
to see
them one knee basically one knee head
down
um and it you you hear
more rumbling and now you start to hear
like screams
and yells from where the pyramids
were
just riding it out and just writing it
out just wait
just wait for the night quiet to descend
again shoot
about 15 minutes pass
an eternity and
one of the people who was
uh who came on the boat says
um are you okay
and it's like standing at hollister's
side
you're mute i slowly raised my head
uh so make me a sand roll
because facing you was a person with
their eyes who did not used to have eyes
i didn't know that oh that's right you
never saw them without eyes yeah
basically i was shouting for them to
avert their eyes
which was the meanest thing ever uh
so they are like the the the 12
innocent people seemed fully healed
and they are very confused
um and
uh i'm fine how are you
uh i get i'm okay i guess i don't
remember a whole lot
why are why are we in the desert
i guess we can start opening our eyes
again right well we got to get emma we
got to go
to get them out i mean well you're here
to help
uh seal an a great
what did they tell you why did they tell
you they brought you here actually
common sense hits me that
that lady told us we were we were going
to
and and help seal away a great evil i
i don't recall that coming up there was
and blood no there was talk of blood it
was talk of blood yes
yes no no
blood is bad no it'll just be like a a
blood donation
it'll it i mean it'll be as painless as
a shot
wait so real blood not not metaphor
oh okay okay well i guess if it helps
what
emma do we all wake up now do we i mean
yeah you're all you're all you were all
awake and so
yeah you all see the people who lost
their
eyes now have their eyes again oh my god
i just grab one by the head and i'm just
like
you can see blind can see
it is a miracle what's up with
alexandria
um she is a six foot tall black woman
where is alexandria that's not
did we leave her behind was anybody
hollister weren't you on the oh no you
weren't on the b team
that's outstanding i forgot about that
uh
it's not i succeeded my sand roll at
least all right
standing in front of you and just like i
i send my hands out in front of me and
turn them back and forth
no do we need to go back for her you
think she's
no you think he's dead i'm right
here i thought i heard her voice i
really did
but yeah she was i knocked her out and
then
she turned into this lady and then we
all ran he turned into
this is neither chris
this is dieter chris are you sure i
thought she was dead i thought the black
pharaoh killed her
yes he said that she was gone but then
uh
alex when i picked her up it was it was
alex
well yeah i mean he's tricky like that
this could be any lady this could be his
mom for all wait don't we have a safe
word
don't we have a safe word that alex
got a de luna it's still me
um alexandra make me a power roll
with mine or knight of christmas with
yours
okay 46 success
okay you are aware
of donald's deal with
knight with this whole thing so you know
and nida chris is pissed about being
killed
and is almost as pissed about being
just look in the back of my head look
i'm not happy about this either
i wonder if there's a ritual to split
beings
oh i'll have to ch i have to look for
this it doesn't matter where's alex
i'm right here are you inside of her
no it's still i don't know
i don't know she just looks different
but she sounds the same i mean
that that sounds like alex alex
that's it this is not a chris it is
definitely not
alexandra's voice there no no but but
the way she's she
yeah yeah expressed herself yeah the the
way i phrase things is still the same
what voice did you use before ezra i
don't remember
for knight across i did not because i
don't want to
you know sure be an egyptian woman
yeah i don't well then i will make it
very more slightly elevated
i you it it is your voice do with it as
you will oh boy
it's still me so what do we do with
cilantro
what what do we do with cilantro we try
to use it against kara siri it didn't
work
is that okay is that is that your safe
word cilantro
interesting it should be oh
alexandra make me a
uh 41 just made it all right you
control yourself
but when when emma says cilantro
the only thing you can think about is
that you can sing again
alex that's you're still inside of her
well still it's a little bit of a
relative term
isn't it but i'm here
this it's me it's still me i can
i can i'm very well aware
donald my skin is usually quite a lot
wow is she consciousness emerging i have
to write
i have to write something about this
what donal is she inside there too
you know what i'm talking about yes she
is
i can i can feel her in the back of my
head she's
both after being killed and being
brought back
like this having to share headspace with
an uppity british girl i think is the
term she used does she remember her own
death
oh yes would you ask her which one
the most recent one within the last
several months it's
rather vivid ow she knows what he did to
her
better yet does she want revenge
hmm so i'll like poke at the back of my
head where i can
feel her presence and be like well
against all of them
how about we point it at that at your
husband who had you killed
all of them no
that one these ones are mine
as long as you wish to believe that are
these conversations that she's having
out
these are mine and i will hold them as
long as i can
and i will enjoy killing each one of
them
oh this is going to be interesting
in the may you live an interesting time
sort of way because i will fight you in
the same way i did your husband
how'd that go for you i'm still alive
again
went pretty well for me then now let's
call that one a draw then
i'm so glad that i recovered all that
sanity that makes me so happy
yeah we're going to be having some talks
40. i suspect no no no no no
allister does that make it
yes okay and 40 you said
i'm sorry 40 yes okay
[Music]
uh joan you unmistakably notice
that alexandra starts almost
subconsciously performing a ritual
oh wow what it's yes and i'll say alex
what are you doing what is what what
what is what what are you talking about
ritual i i you started i'm gonna look
look down at my hands to see what i'm
doing
yeah your hands are your hands are
making
weird symbols and you are you are
thinking
syllables that you have no idea what
they are i'm gonna like clasp my hands
together
and hold them against my chest and just
and just push back against it with
um there's there's a couple of italian
arias that i immediately just start
playing through my head as if i were
practicing yeah
you made the same role yeah and so
you stop
oh but what was that what was it it
wasn't me
oh crap it wasn't me and so i don't know
what exactly that was
you know exactly what's going on you and
emma been through this nonsense before
that goddamn headdress
you said i don't know damn fine i don't
think it's like the headdress
it can take over sometimes
oh but she has so much she wants
information that we could get and i
could i could
no what do you mean no so we need
information we need to know
she is insane
legitimately insane in the back of my
head
i am not going to tap someone who is
insane and wants to see
all of you dead oh well
oh i am not insanity is relative but but
but yeah well if she wants miss dead
forget that
why me you're you're you're
you're in the area your collateral
damage
she's furious what was that amy
so well all that everybody's arguing
stuff i tapped paul strong was like
do you have any can you knock her out
[Laughter]
how'd that go last time you've got the
ether right i'm like you got the
ethernet right
there no that is so sh
[Laughter]
actually there's there's something
there's something i need to do
before i finally get some sleep whatever
it is i want to start walking down to
the pyramid
wait where are you going hollister what
are you doing
i i brought him here
hollister he's done he's probably i have
to see
i have to you're not supposed to go back
and look
he was prepared to give his life for
this cause
he gave his life for his beliefs yes
hollister
we had another ally no no no he wasn't
had another ally he was butchering
people
he was butchering people
and he was under i pointed the pyramids
his influence
he was his ally
you never talked to us about it or told
us or anything we could have figured it
out
he was he helped me he helped us i'm the
one who knows how to do this stuff now
you i kept telling you i kept trying to
warn you you didn't want to listen
that's on you on me
i'm walking down killer all right yeah
you start to head down towards the
pyramid
okay if he dies that's fine whatever
he's whatever
so professor lam just like throws her
arms up and walks away
yep hollister is walking down towards
the pyramid
uh anybody else doing anything i'm just
going to turn and look at donald
from my now [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] elevated position
it's now about four in the morning
coming up coming up on 24 hours yeah
she's so late back at the camp right so
hollister
you come down to the pyramid and
uh you enter
uh and make your way you you can find
your way back
to that and
you come into the chamber of the black
pharaoh
and you see the elder sign
and the entire room is just full of salt
there's about a foot and a half of
it's about a foot and a half of salt
deep and sitting on the throne
is the black pharaoh just still watching
bemusedly
is there anything well that's unsettling
obviously
um i don't believe we've met
let's keep it that way and i'll walk
over to the
the sign is there anything left of don
julio
is there like a bottle filled with clear
fluid
there no oh man maybe there should be
uh i was gonna go with a crucifix but
i'll accept a flask with like a
yeah there's a something that perhaps
looks like this
there is a silver flask with a
um with the seal of the vatican on it
all right i'll i'll pick it up and
that'll have to do
for making some more
sort of a memorial for him say hello to
my wives for me
uh all right yeah you come walking back
up yeah
i'll try and get some sticks to i'm
going to be putting like a crucifix on a
crucifix
but
yeah like you bury the flask essentially
yeah
i don't know i mean should this be
should this be brought back to the
vatican
for them to i don't know i grab it from
him and open it and smell it does it
smell like alcohol or does it smell like
holy water no that is alcohol
oh okay i'm gonna have a swag here you
go are we all back in camp
or what are we doing oh yeah no we're
we're at the camp and and yeah i just
yeah a hollister came back oh well so
i'm drinking
whatever whatever we got i'm sleeping
okay so i passed the don julio
like flask over to donald i was like
there you go i did
god bless you old man god bless you i i
pour some out for himself
[Laughter]
nice yeah that is uh
that is um
[Music]
that yeah that is great i'm enjoying
in the chat vendish
sean is making batman 66 references for
the uh
all the people turned into dust makes me
oh my goodness oh my goodness
uh so unless are you guys gonna
get some sleep what is i don't know
i'm actually donald i'm concerned that
night of chris is gonna do something
while we're asleep i know that
alexander is in control right now but is
there any way that we can guarantee that
she stays in control while we sleep
if i'm i'm near them right yeah yes
in fact that's why i was like get the
ether
i'm not going to okay i'm going to walk
over is where's
your camp is not large you got you most
of your camp is when you were trying to
like keep all of the
not innocent people away from you so um
your actual part of it is quite small
you guys are all in a very small area a
small area
all right so i want to respond to emma's
comment and he's donald's basically
going to say like
he doesn't even care you're just like
where where
are you that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] headdress was more
important to all of you
to all of you we had to keep it we had
to keep it that was more important
the corrupting influence of this whole
goddamn party
we keep that damn thing and we know what
it was right i could never take it
i could never take it from you i'm
walking through any of you to take the
goddamn address and this is where we are
now
this is where we are donald this is the
problem
look at her look at what happened to her
i know it's not the person that
you've been hanging out it's not alex
so i can see her i'm i i'm i'm a little
ways away probably on the other side of
of of the truck just like leaning
against it arms wrapped around myself i
can hear all of this of course because
donald's not
quiet i don't know i'm going to try to
try to calm him down but
i'm walking over to her no no
all right hollister what are you
saying to alexander i'll i'll look up at
him as he comes over and say
don't you dare stick me with one of your
needles
if you're gonna sleep do you want
something to make sure that
she doesn't take control while you do
that
any suggestions i would stick you with
one of these needles
no and then when it's time to wake up i
being knocked out is what made this
happen in the presence of a black
pharaoh
and i'm just giving this to you as a
suggestion
i i honestly don't have anything
we can we can if it helps we can talk
and she actually was like burst out
laughing tears running down her cheeks
just like
what sort of training do you have to
deal with two minds
inside of one body where one of them is
actively trying to kill the other
what sort of training does your delta
green give you for that
dr hollister oh yeah split personalities
i cannot split personalities it's
nothing so mundane
well an egyptian queen from centuries
ago
in my head
if it walks like a duck looks like a
duck and quacks like a duck you treat it
like a duck
i will actually stab you and when you
ugh duck
45. all right um
there's a brief second hollister when
she says i will actually stab you
that like her hand slides towards a
dagger
and then and then i just like regain
control and that was a joke
but i i am being serious
it might be one of the best options you
have and
if it can help don't you want to try my
concern
is that if i am chemically removed from
control of my own body
i'm still me i'm still alexandria
i'm still me and
i don't know what to do about this
yeah i mean it's
it's i think less about
than it is that you're in another body
and being seen
as someone else you're
you're going to have to reconstruct
yourself and how people see you
but you have control over that
it'll be gradual you won't be able to
instantly convince everyone to see you
the same way but over time
i just had something good i'm gonna have
to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lose it
and i hate this damn it i'm sorry
no no it's what i'm here for um
i mean i can sing again my
it's it's her throat it wasn't torn to
pieces in peru
i could have that but what have i i've
lost
you just need time you can barely look
at me the same way
i just want to say for the record i'm
giving the same clinical look that i
can't
yeah but i said but i saw the look on
your face prior to you sliding the
clinical
especially at the i could kill you part
well that was the same
look yeah you got you got you got it
like oh yeah
that's alexandria book right there yeah
fair enough
um i
do not want to chemically lose control
because i don't want to
give her the opportunity to puppet
i don't know where mine is i don't know
i'd like to get back into it for
well my suggestion is just to
take it one step at a time and we'll see
i i know that's your that's your biggest
goal but you have to be willing to
take the small victories along the way
i mean can it be called a goal properly
if i don't know if it can ever be
achieved for all i know
that body's gone thrown out into
the emptiness of whatever
i can't really speak with any authority
on magic but
that's maybe the one thing i've learned
well you've if my
experiences with delta green have taught
me anything they have certainly
i mostly read about it up until now
actually
is this your first field assignment
well i've worked with uh
i've seen some things under controlled
environments but oh if you think for a
second that working with with aldridge's
controlled environments you need to have
another thinking very
quickly oh oh no before i left i
actually stressed the need to
i'm going to try to get some rest okay
you look all in you should sleep
but i will i'll i'll
sleep in the truck that way if
if something goes wrong you'll have a
truck
i won't i won't be near enough to
immediately stab anyone before i have a
chance to regain control
you could leave your daggers in another
place
and i could say that for a long time
and and you could walk around buck ass
naked that would be
so i mean my last question is
i think so i think we brought we grabbed
everything that was in the truck
yeah there's plenty of food plenty of
bed roll um
it is so by the time
you all get any sort of modicum of sleep
um it is the heat of the afternoon on
tonight is the full moon
i thought that was the sixth oh sorry
tomorrow yeah the night tomorrow night
so so tonight
will be the almost full tomorrow will be
full so tomorrow
at sundown you begin the ritual
uh when i wake up when the heat comes
i'm gonna ask
if it's okay to do the ritual if the
black pharaoh is still in the pyramid
because he's still in the pyramid yeah
i'm assuming
he should be in the pyramid because
that's what we're doing is we're sealing
anybody who wants to can make a cthulhu
mythos role
uh alexander if you'd like you can make
a cthulhu mythos roll with
uh knight of is a mythos
you'll learn things too don't trust ezra
that's the first rule of call of cthulhu
is don't trust the keeper
but this feels too important to not so
i'll make the cthulhu meet those for all
with ninety chris's
emma made a lot of sense though we are
sealing the evil in there so it makes
sense for him to be there
lunch would have it what time is it what
do you want
in the morning afternoon this is the
afternoon by the time everybody
like gets a a some modicum of sleep
it's probably about
three or four on the afternoon did
anybody make the
mythos all right yeah emma's exactly
right
um uh
that um
[Music]
that you know you're sealing him in
there so having him in there
is fine and so i need you to do two
things alexandra one
i need you to wonder why he's not
leaving and two
pick a spot on your like just right on
the margin of your character sheet
okay
he he he should stay in there
the whole point of a is us sealing him
in there but
well maybe
i mean i'm more worried about if we need
to
check the tunnels or if we need to uh
i mean honestly i want to go in the
tunnels because it's cooler in there but
also if we need to do searches around to
see if anything's
now did the d holes tunnels that it made
when it was going around
and i like we're just calling them d
halls now um
and you know john you could always
yeah well yeah but what for what purpose
at this point i'm trying to figure out
what
you know do we need to go up through the
pyramid i thought about that
um but we don't want to disturb it we
want the pyramid to be
and as you recall the dhole couldn't
actually like it went through the
pyramid almost like the pyramid was
insubstantial
uh so okay are you gonna do
anything i mean like is there anything
what do you want to do before the ritual
tomorrow
for my character i think he's going to
drink and sulk and speak
all right yeah he's just he's he's super
depressed
all right yep so i'm gonna prepare
everybody
and ask them to like cleanse themselves
we're gonna we're gonna
um what's that one sacrament can you
bring commute communion to everybody and
no it's taking a confession all right
so yeah you will take confession from
everybody
um most of them are confessing that
they don't remember a lot about the last
couple days
and they're a little worried about that
but um
they yeah they will gladly take
confession
uh and and you know do whatever hail
mary's that you want to get and
basically you're going to spend this
time like like praying them up
yeah yeah all right um
professor lam anything you want to do
before this ritual i'm reading through
the books
again do i have any
any sense of that ritual to make things
speed up at all
because i was thinking i would be able
to do a little maybe a little
not not as good as clive but
um i might be able to do a little
i mean you can certainly try i'm going
to all right
i'm going to try because i got to read
his other books i got to see if there's
anything else that we need
anytime a gm says you can certainly try
just run
no no because knowledge is power
sorry i think i misunderstood you are
not using
uh clive's magic to make
the ritual go faster right right
though you're talking about to read
books
okay yeah you can totally do that um
uh so we took that box of books from him
and i want to see if there's anything
else in there
that that we could use basically i'll be
um so did you
learn the time ritual i thought i did
but that's why i was
uh i wasn't sure i don't recall you
learning the time ritual okay
okay well i'm still gonna look through
the books
yeah okay i'm gonna try i'm gonna do
this what are you what are you trying to
get out of there are you trying to learn
more about
the ritual tomorrow are you trying to
well i was thinking of more about how to
keep us safe
oh okay because i have the i have the
elder sign
yeah i mean i could do a bunch of that
you need to make an elder sign
so you know that for this ritual you
have to be you're placing the capstone
right and you're going to have this line
of people who are going to be filling it
with blood
right over the course of the night um
and i mean it's technically not that
dangerous a ritual
if you spread the blood loss out over a
bunch right
right no i'm thinking more of other
things coming after us
you know can i make a perimeter can i
make is there something
else i could do oh i got this yeah we've
got this ritual
and but i know that there's other
creatures and things out there is there
anything else i can do to protect us
in this area and that's one of the
things
let's see here think about it think
about it
uh make me a luck roll
oh yeah okay uh
so you you think
so yeah you think that you've you've
found stuff
that will talk about magnifying
so first of all the the whole point of
the capstone ritual
is protection so like that that's
that's one of the things you think
you've found something that will allow
you
to um
make super big elder signs
um but it seems like it's
costly it's gonna take too much power to
do that we don't
we need to have these people with their
power to give them i was just hoping
there was some weight i can i could make
it bigger that we would be protected
not just the capstone but the crew
that's all
okay i mean you you
if you're the whole story of magic is if
you're willing to pay the cost you can
probably do something
that depends on the cost we don't have a
lot of blood here we don't have a lot of
of of extra of those kinds of things
here
i do have and i don't have a lot of
extra sanity
but that could be part of it i i
would do that to keep
keep everybody safe so think about it
i'll think about it
i'll keep reading i'll keep reading all
right alexandra
you have probably more time than you
but what are you doing during this day
before the ritual
so a lot of what i'm doing at least
initially is trying to adjust to this
new body
trying to adjust to seeing everything
from a foot taller my arms are longer my
legs are longer
like working through some of the kadas
that i know from
knife work trying to see where i am with
that
um and i mean i'm i'm pressing all like
i have spent
a couple decades learning how how to use
a knife to the point where it's muscle
memory but i still remember
like my training so here's the thing
these are not your muscles yeah no
there's
no muscle memory here for this now that
spell casting thing
that was muscle memory the the hand
signs of the rituals and things like
that
that was second nature you are
fighting against
yourself with this knife stuff there is
no muscle memory
it is it is to the to the credit of
your training
and your experience that you know you're
able to get stuff down but yeah you're
starting to move your body and get used
to
uh how that works it's not fun in
the heat
but i'm i'm pushing through it because
it hurts and that is important for me
right now
okay says says it says someone who used
to be a self-harmer
not a great thing to say whatever um
periodically glancing over at where
donna is and just like
that is a scene that will have to happen
at some point but you that is a
that is that is all up to you guys yeah
donald talk to anybody donald do you
talk to anybody
no he's talking right now he's just he's
way
retreating into himself and he's talking
to a model yeah he's really drowning his
sorrows up
so he's he's kind of he's retreated
basically all right so i think we're
going to fast forward to the ritual
oh i've got a lot of i'm sorry hollister
like what
well first of all i want to set up set
aside enough fluids that they can
rehydrate
after i'm growing the blood because we
need to say i've got
oranges like we're all in full pressure
i don't know when people get drunk they
go through oranges
[Laughter]
donald just has orange slices next to
him
i'm just drowning his sorrow and oranges
i think i love citrus it's good for a
broken heart
i'm gonna do a once-over on all my
medical equipment but yeah i'm actually
gonna go
i'm gonna go down into the tunnels for a
little bit and just like listen around
to see if i hear anything coming
okay i'm gonna peek back into the
pyramid not go to the full chamber but
check the walls for the ink to wipe it
down if i see any
it does not seem like any of that ink is
there there might be some salt
like when you when you sort rub across
it there's some salt in the wall
huh he's thorough
i don't think we can put god in the
title of a show but that's okay
cthulhu you can cram god in there all
you want
um i think i think if it's capital g
i think i think that that's when they
start being like oh what's going on here
but
uh but i will i will suggest to the
others maybe
scouting around the perimeter as it gets
towards evening to make sure
if anyone wants to do that that'd be
lovely
anyone no one's responding okay you're
going really
fast so like yeah as long as someone
goes with me
yeah okay i mean i've been walking all
like let's cast a baleful glare over at
where donald has been sulking all day
but can we go out
it seems like there is not like nobody
around
um it is blissfully quiet when you do
just a quick
uh perimeter check
so i'm i'm thinking he'll get up
sometime with the sun's going down just
as a note
that's when he's done sulking so yeah so
uh again
is there anything that you want to do
donal or otherwise i think we're going
to fast forward to the ritual
yeah i think at some point the evening
he'll go out in
the dunes and as the sun's going down
it's cooler yeah
and maybe alex and we can talk yeah
are you carrying knives still oh yeah
always
they're not the same are they the same
knives yes they look much smaller now
i mean they're on they're on a larger
body but they're the same knives
all right the outfit is different the
outfit is still
that white dress i'm gonna have to get
different clothes when we go back to
cairo
four now two of them turned into snakes
while i was on the
i had sex six ah
that counts off i always forget about
the one that
do you have control yes
it's an egyptian queen with a great deal
of power
and knowledge hard to say but at least
for the moment
i'm in control what does she want
revenge and if she gets a revenge
will she be satisfied i don't think
she's ever properly satisfied
where's her body yours
because you you were there you i had you
i had you in my arms for just a moment
and then it was
i don't know where my body went i wish i
did i'd like to get back to it
it's i think he's playing a trick this
must be a game he's playing
this can't be real
i'll i'll i'll reach out and then put a
hand put just put a hand on his shoulder
i mean this body is real
yeah it doesn't doesn't feel like you it
doesn't feel like me
i know i know you're in there alex and i
know you're in there so um
we have to get you out or get you back
or get you something like i just don't
know what to do with with her
i don't either but stop talking about me
as if i'm not here
i just i'm worried
i how long you'll be here
you're worried try having an angry queen
in the back of your head
is there anything that she knows that we
could use to
to change this probably
the more that i rely on her knowledge
the more control she gets i'm very sure
about that then it comes down to joan
it's still me donald and i believe you i
it's just i don't trust her i don't
trust him i don't
yes well let's go back shall we
let's let's just take a walk first
let's go back interfere
fine we'll go back in a few
i need just a little time with you
perhaps just getting used to
this
i'm taller than you i never thought that
would happen i
didn't think so either it doesn't feel
right looking
up and you've gotten so short on me
i'm the same size right i haven't it's
i can look down at you it's hilarious
not that funny from where i'm standing
frankly
it's funny from where i'm standing above
you
you still make the same faces though so
it's
still me it's still here
i i keep telling myself that then i
think
maybe a few more bottles and a little
i don't think that's going to help donal
no i mean numbing isn't going to help
it works for emma so i figure it works
i'm sorry i don't know what to this is
new to me right
it's mostly new to me it's got to be
it's not the first time i've jumped into
a head
the memories were just a great deal more
similar than
i always forget about that the you
i knew isn't really the whole year
it's about right yeah and then i knew
you but then there was but then
i from another universe jumped into
i never really noticed you know i've
never really noticed
differently it's the same
same year there was almost no difference
the me from that universe and me from
this universe were almost identical
there were a few
details that were different but
as far as settling into a new reality
this is quite a bit of a different jump
sure
it's still all brain shenanigans
i guess i don't know maybe that's all we
are is what some
electrochemical something in our brain
has been around or maybe it's a soul is
it a soul
i think emma would say that's the soul
right
and if that's the case the soul of
alexandria hartford the person
that you know is the one in control
at least for the moment let's keep it
touched by it
all right well walk with me a bit eric
you could stand on the lower side of the
dune so maybe
i love all that oh okay
you just like looking down at me you
uh so we cut away
and we cut to
actually yeah when when alexandria gets
back or more importantly as it
like about an hour or so before uh
the ritual is about to begin i want to
uh pull alexandria aside
there's there's there's one last
what a source of evil that could
would you be willing to take the truck
out
a ways maybe you could grab one of uh
donald's rifles with the scopes on it
i i don't know for sure but
i don't i don't think it's a good idea
we've come too far for me to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it all
up
i won't i won't take a rifle he needs
those and i'm
terrible at them i can barely aim the
damn scope
well i was just saying you just take the
scope and use it as a little
we have we have binoculars i think oh
yeah
i don't i'll take binoculars
how far out should i go i think just
a little over a mile
i honestly can't gauge how far that is
uh
and i don't know how many miles on the
sand or gallons to miles the jeep gets
so
well i imagine this this truck doesn't
do well on the sand anyway from what
i've heard
so i'll drive down the road back toward
darshore give it some distance
so how far away are you going um
as far as practical terms i'll probably
go about a mile and a half to two miles
out
just to make sure that i'm outside of
that mile circumference but i'll
tell the i i don't want this to just be
something that hollister and i know
okay so i'll tell i'll tell the others
i have what could be the source of great
of a great evil in my head
so i need to not be here when this
happens
for no other reason that i might [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it
up whether
by my mere presence or her trying to
take control
yeah the ritual thing says something
about those who detest evil
the self-loathing count
[Laughter]
oh no i think this is a good idea and
that way you'll be able to see around us
too
and i know you're not good with a rifle
but maybe having one to give us a shot
so we can
hear that there's a problem or something
coming there's a problem what are we
supposed to do
at least we can see it we might be able
to protect against it
so when these dunes if you're going a
mile away you're not going to be
you're not going to have any visibility
i i won't be
i won't be able to see anything i just
need to be
i'm sorry i wish i could be here and
help
this is her husband this is something
that
she could very easily interfere with
and this is everything right now right
here
hear this is that something that she
wants well it might also be the reason
why the black pharaoh is waiting
for me to come to come in that's right
for the ritual to just not work
we use up the blood we miss our window
i don't like it but that makes it makes
sense all right
so about an hour before the ritual
alexandra gets in the truck some of
the poor innocents wonder why the truck
is leaving
because they are now out in the middle
of the desert
i hope there's more wine because that
lady drank most of it
yes you did i was going to correct them
uh so the ritual just to remind
you
the ritual will start let's see here so
um the ritual starts at moonrise
and you start filling
the eye in the eye of light and darkness
which i believe joan can
once again show us there so you see it's
just that dot
in the eye that is being filled um
and it's being filled uh
every so
the blood of an innocent is used to fill
the pupil of the eye
every drum beat and so
you know there's just a tiny bit of you
know it's not that much blood but it's
not it's not nothing i'm german i'm
gonna be the drummer boy for this ritual
all right blood letter um
and i'm lead singer
and an orange slice dispenser so so
alexandra is not
at the site is anybody else not up at
the top of the
pyramid no we're all going to play in
the drum i got to be
close enough to do my thing so that's
true
so you're all going to be up at the top
of the pyramid
we need donald there's any way out of it
i will not be
but i can't imagine i i the logistics
just aren't working
if you think anybody else there can draw
blood in a clinical fashion
probably alexandra yeah
that doesn't help she's not so good
at
at the stopping of the drawing of the
blood but yeah i i
i'll take my message my first aid's
better than his
that's true but i'm not i'm not putting
them in a situation where the first date
is necessary
and so emma has taught these poor people
this chant
and and you guys have all practiced this
oh no i won't do i won't do no i won't
do magic okay
so so you are not participating in
the ritual
i'm participating in the extent of
drawing the blood
i'm focusing on that and getting the
blood to the unless someone else wants
to have the honor of filling the
eye with the blood ulster's like our
high priest who's doing the sacrifices
for us you know
so i i i mean in a in a rich
joan you would know that in a
ritualistic sense
what he's doing is not participating in
the in the ceremony.
i've i've watched you over the past
three days
i'm okay with not participating in any
magic
you just like killing. i don't enjoy it
in the least
dr hollister yeah well you
saw what i was focused on.
Moonrise. The ritual starts, chanting begins for two hours there are six more
there are two of you that this ritual will tax almost to death
but you're feeling pretty good
this ritual needs a certain amount of
power and so
i'm i'm going with just the base amount
of power that it requires to complete um
you are both going to end up with almost
no pal left
when this is done now it's probably not
permanent
ah you can sleep it off you got the
inspiration i
i'm willing to just power through
so what is that so is that is that no
i don't know what that means is that is
that rolling it out i'm taking your
offer
okay because i i rolled i rolled good
once i don't know how many more times i
could do that so
we've got inspiration but we don't have
enough to like
but yeah because if i lose 10 in on a
couple i'm done
right it's true i mean
maybe but i need to get all the way
through it and so instead of
trying to chance my way through it
i'm willing to take the average but
you've got
inspiration so if we're if we're doing
an inspiration average
it's going to be lower but it's
it's a chance you're right so anyhow
i'm going to shut up now because it's
your choice
so i don't know what i i saw that's my
choice what what
emma did you have a i kind of was
feeling the same way just because it's
like
but there is a chance that i could fail
every single roll
i mean it's not like that wouldn't
happen to oh wait
yeah and there could be a chance that
one of those roles could be a critical
fail
you could have some critical success yes
i was going to say what happens if we
get a failure oh a fumble would be
delicious
yeah see you devour the flesh of
uh all right so it sounds like you're
taking the average then yes yep
okay so i'm gonna do that for
everybody then
so the people the people look happy the
innocent people
look haggard at the end of all this but
they look okay
um you were rolling for their average
pow and you rolled a 72
so they're they're in pretty good shape
um
at the end of this let's see so
six more we're just gonna say five each
time so
uh joan
you will have 15
pow emma
you will have 10 pow thanks
uh donal you will have
30 pow
a pillar of light
shoots into the sky and you see
in the sky that symbol of the eye of
light of darkness and it rolls down into the capstone and infuses it and you have sealed
the black pharaoh
the pyramid so
sealed
i was thinking we don't want to go in and break the top
Alexandra, we cut to you sitting on the the truck
you see that light shoot into the sky
i'm an incredible amounts of pain right
until i can get my own body back
once i know that the ritual's over um
i'll i'll get back in the truck and drive back toward them
the others go inside the pyramid
and it's totally clean and you
you go to where the chamber of the black
pharaoh is, you can't even get into that chamber
so something is sealed you know it seems
like
you were successful is
so it's like this it's like the wall is
there
you know that wasn't there before
huh i'm just wondering if joan would
want to
read these in particular oh well i've
never got time for that but um
it looks like the goal was to seal him
inside right and it appears that that's
we should go back and celebrate right
celebrate with a nap
yeah you all feel incredibly drained
that's what i was going to say what is
the feeling of that pow going away
is there any other any other feeling
it's like um
it's kind of like jet lag you just you
feel a little
like you just you're kind of not quite
there
i wonder if i could get it back from the
other people
like i do when i hear this would you
like it would you like to try
i'm not hearing this that that's the
code for the ages
i don't want to hurt anybody but i would
like to get my cow back
let's let's do i'm not in there
so i'm outside yeah joan are you gonna
are you going to
uh are you gonna suck the life out of
it's not their life it's just some
energy
it's like yeah
that's another excellent one geez
um make me a power roll joan
now you know what it's like to be
silvano
all right so i didn't say i didn't
fumble i didn't
but it would it would have been fine if
i was fine
[Laughter]
that is that's cthulhu in a nutshell i
think it'd be fine if it was fine
exactly it's fine if i could be if i
were fine
um so
you you feel like that would have
worked
um okay and actually i'll give you
you gain 10 pow
i run over i check them i i i i see if
they have a pulse
they are very they have a pulse they
are very unconscious
okay and and then you realize that these
people went through the same thing you
did
so they don't have a lot of power shoot
all right well no so now he this poor
uh he's got like um
uh you know his like cheeks are sunken
he does not he seems he's not like dying
or anything but there's definitely
like you know he's he's he's been
happier
all right i'll get some cloths i'll put
them on his head i'll tell people
hey you know this is what happens when
you there's some you know you go through
this kind of
experience make sure they're eating
oranges all that stuff
so so so you're leaving out the part
where you did this to him
yes all right yeah that's i just wanted
to check that
uh all right yeah the the people get
a little worried about this so you guys
come out and one of the people is
unconscious
but everybody else seems fine
was there what where's the truck
so the truck comes pulling up
hey and again you are
wrapped with really bad pain
okay so i like step out of the truck and
then like go down to one knee just like
breathing for a moment
just oh okay
the person that passed out did they look
this bad when i went into the pyramid
we all just know it at this point man
at least you didn't go to the party
i mean they weren't around don't follow
this path i want to go see what's up
with alex and why she's in pain
all right are you
are you still there i'm here what's
going on
knight of chris is in a lot of pain in
my head and it's coming through to me
i think i think that's what's going on
the thing the eye on the top does that
do something like it keeps the evil away
or something
maybe you can make a cthulhu mythos roll
i've got
none of that
yeah no thanks i'm not giving knight of
chris another hash mark
today
emma's looking at
alexandria is still
a very tall statuesque beautiful black
woman
you finish the ritual
we've done this is what we came here to
do
sealed that bastard away but what what
do we do now
there's other aspects of the one whose
right bloody hell
this just this allowed was was too much
how many more god no
there's only four more well for what
it's worth every time that we've sealed
one of these damn things away it's done
something physically to me
that's not helpful so there is as far as
you know
the moth creature something in africa
and the sand bat and the sand bat in
australia
so three more and then that dragon
island or something
but australia is kind of big no
not small either so no but it's
india we know specifically that it's
kenya that helps
and we know where specific it's not
shanghai it's the great dragon island
that's where she is
all right right and you have a few leads
from
very early on in new york to
australia
but not we should be able to get some
more we should be able to find some more
once we get some of these other things
and you have until january
yay we're only halfway through the year
um so are you guys leaving presently are
you hanging around
what is oh i'm i'm loading people back
at the truck we're getting ready to take
i'm taking my time i'm gonna sit down
i'm gonna take my time
i think emma i i think emma wants to see
what happens if i keep losing magic
points
and and we are actually pretty much out
of supplies now
we we didn't bring enough supplies for
people
uh alexandra make an intelligence role
okay
uh 26 is a hard success
all right so after you lose your
you you figure out that this seems to be
kind of hourly okay
pretty regularly on the hour you get
this
racking pain hmm so so
i feel that racking pain go through me i
look at my watch and go
oh the rest of us notice
that she keeps having this issue uh
you've only seen this is the first one
you've seen
okay but but this is the third time that
i've experienced it so it's
i'll look over at emma to see if she's
watching me because i feel like she is
yeah i am this is she does not change
any you know her physical appearance
doesn't change um
it's just all of a sudden there's a
there's a wince
okay cameron what are you thinking what
thoughts like what
well for whatever it's worth this seems
to be happening every hour on the hour
i don't know why i think it's to do with
the ritual
and it's probably a good idea dr
hollister that i was not here when it
happened
do you need anything for the pain
it's pain i've dealt with it before
let's not be here for a while for much
longer shall we
yes i mean unless you really want me
unconscious in the next seven hours
how many people do i fit into the truck
there yeah you're
you're ready to go i just had an
interesting thought
how far is doshur from the red pyramid
i thought it was like four hours or so
yeah we drove like four hours to get
there
yeah and they walked like half a day
yeah all right
uh so you guys who's driving
not me you do not want me in pain while
driving
joan is driving sounds good so
um let's see here
yeah 16 which for me is a hard
success
nice so you keep up a very good speed
um despite the lack of roads um
you're going about 12
you go about 12 to 15 miles an hour uh
so you lose
tiana the next hour you lose one more
but then the second hour you do not lose
one
the next hour of the trip and i'm like
watching my watch just waiting
and bracing myself for the second one
and then it's like
huh i guess we're far enough away
it's something to do with with the
ritual nidakris
offered to tell me what was going on if
i gave her back her body
that doesn't sound like a good trade you
made the right choice
until i get my own back i'd prefer to
not get kicked out into the void of
nothingness
uh it must be a bargain we can make with
whom
the thing in your head perhaps or maybe
like i said maybe it's joan
maybe jones reading can find something
maybe once we've all gotten some rest we
can uh
have a word with her that i mean nyada
chris
and then see what happens
so you get to joshua
and your truck is stopped immediately
and they want everybody out of the truck
how many men are talking about
there's like a dozen men here okay
well we don't have anything that they
can steal so
well i guess we i guess we're going all
right
in the box cool 19. so
alexandra steps out of the truck and
you understand alexander and joan you
would understand because you speak
arabic
the men say my queen and they all start
bowing to alexandra i can piece this
together
and they like genuflect when you step
it's just another role tell them
something good yes tell them something
good
and
uh maybe maybe use uh
whisper something to her and then have
it would not look right for a white
woman to speak for me
you are well aware of that your
egyptian isn't very good last i checked
it got a lot better yeah fine no
[Music]
um you got this so i'm looking at the
i will pull myself up to the fullest
regal regal pulling on all of my stage
training
from all of the times when i when i've
played someone who's far more highbrow
than i am hold myself up my chin up
just and
uh i'm going to regret this speak
speak to them in an egyptian all right
i'm going to make you an offer
go ahead you can
roll to see if this works or not and if
it doesn't work
things might go south or you can just
put that hash mark down next to nidacres
name
well hold on there's going to be a hash
there's going to be a hash mark if
okay if you so mechanically when you do
things that only knight occurs can do
she gets a little more control
okay
and we're gonna given that i just made
that up we're going to figure out what
it means but
there's actually nothing in the book
about nida chris becoming one of the
players so
i thought this was entirely you
um yeah i will
all right i want to succeed this i want
us to get out of here without dying
i'll give her the hash mark okay
so i will i will raise myself up to full
regal bearing using
alexandria's stage training but also
pulling from knight of chris's
natural regal demeanor and speak to them
in an egyptian and say my my children
you have done well we we have we have
accomplished the goal that we came here
to accomplish
and now i and these people are going to
leave
and what are our orders my queen
stand against the black pharaoh in all
of his forms all of his people
wait what the black pharaoh do came to
deceive you
i stand as truth we are no longer
the sons of the black pharaoh no longer
yes we will claim this country in your
name my queen
uh i will i will go and tell your
command
give me something that so i can prove
do i feel anything from night of christ
if only you had my scarabs hmm
let's answer that question another time
perhaps
um pulling from my memories
of of not a chris i will take a piece of
like parchment or
um something and draw the scarab on it
all right the guy looks a little
confused when you do that but he's like
of course my queen and they will
skedaddle
they were like a weird combination of
fascinated terrified and like really
excited
about that whole thing because as far
as they know you're dead
yeah and as soon as they're gone as soon
as they're out of eye shot i just like
drop
down and and rest my arms on my knees
just like okay
nada chris really wanted control
hmm i'm all
i'm all right let's get out of here
while the getting's good
good call thank you we are on their side
or something
no gods you don't want to know what i
told them
i told them they no longer serve the
black pharaoh and they are going to clay
they're they were going to serve they
were going to serve a monarch regardless
at least i've turned them away from the
i hope it's enough i don't think it is
but
let's get out of this contract it
stopped being our problem let's get out
of here
agreed all right so you come down to the
harbor
there's no boat is there oh no there's
there's a boat
uh and um
in his shirt sleeves working on the
boat
and he he jesus i have repaired your
boat
sir mom
knew my mom
you're a genius you
may not want to go below decks milady is
uh
a lady is in a poor mood
we appreciate the warning we'll stay
above jackson
let's get back to cairo so that we can
take ship elsewhere
yeah get all these people out of here oh
sir
uh and who
among you is the sailor
i just put my sword in my in my in my
pants pocket put my hat on
and so it's at that point that you all
realize
that emma still has
that sword of Akmala mm-hmm
i want to look at it does nida krish
react to that
at all because the last time we saw it
it was stabbing the damn girdle
and emma prime i think this is the
actual sword of akmala as opposed to the
not actual one but it looks exactly like
the one that we used
so she does not know this the the um
this is the actual sword of Akmala and
you know other than it it hating evil
and nidochris being evil you know yep
everything's fine i
i i really wish that i that i knew what
[Laughter]
there's something you love to hear wow i
i want gonna just pilot this boat the
best i can
by this time by this time it's about
two in the afternoon on saturday
the 6th wait sorry sunday the 7th
um we skipped we skipped a day in
montage there
so it is sunday june 7th
and um
with with with emma's
great sailing ability um
you it will take you twice as long to
get to cairo
uh so you will pull into cairo early in
and at this point i will ask you
first thing we need to do is take care
of these people
bye-bye yeah we'll we'll we'll like
usher them back
i think to the church for the church to
be
back under the care of their parish um
i'm
genuinely delighted that none of them
died what happened to the person who
fainted
he is still unconscious
i'll take him to the military base then
okay
yeah they'll they'll start to they'll
they'll give him
some medical care they they think he'll
be okay
okay he's kind of in a coma all right
so we have three options right
we have kenya we have out we have we
have australia
and we have shanghai i don't want to go
to china
i'd love to go to australia adam lynn is
gonna love
you but we wouldn't
we wouldn't go to shanghai it's it's
that horrible island great dragon you
need to go to
and that's a death trap but we need to
go to shanghai in order to get the
statue that we need
to use in the same way and the innocent
people that we're gonna have to get
in order to not kill people we can we
can make a statue
we can make a statue we still need the
innocence you could go to japan
and see it that's the question where are
we going next
oh and sounds like a great place to
visit
why don't we go try and blow up a
different country for a while
let's go to canada yeah let's go to
austin yeah let's just avoid
us i'd love i'd love to go to australia
you know it's one of those places
so for me and i will actually a moment
and be like
well actually we are in africa right
[Laughter]
totally accurate we um
on your you stopped in kenya
it's one of the stops on the the
shipping route to
shanghai so it's technically
on the way yeah logistically i think
it's best
because we don't have the teleporter
anymore to go to kenya and
follow the leads that that we have there
follow the penhue expedition
pengu the what is his name
parallel thank you harlow follow the
carlisle
yeah that follow the carlisle expedition
and see what we can do there
i mean we're starting to retread some a
lot of the same ground and i don't want
to go back out to great dragon island i
really don't want to
last that's last yeah
it feels like it should be right that's
why i'm thinking we should go to
australia first because it's farther
away and then we come back we can make
the hops
well i i think we go to kenya and then
go down to australia
because kenya is on the way to anywhere
that we go and we
also have more leads for kenya and
obviously
shanghai than we do australia we're
starting from scratch in australia
do we have we have a way to contact our
uh
our friends at delta if we go i'll look
over at hollister at that
oh i when i stopped at the military
base i would have uh
reached out to rogers to
what do you tell him give him a brief of
what happened
do you tell him that nida chris is back
i tell him lots of stuff you tell him
that
well all right why don't nick you're
very good at this send me
uh before next week send me a message
with what you told
rogers just so i can keep track of what
he knows and how he's going to react to
it
um so you would know just
geopolitically
that kenya is a british protectorate
and so the british government will be
you know in a more in a more substantial
way than
they were in egypt before you guys
i'm exempt from that i only helped make
egypt better
[Laughter]
um there are so you guys are going to
uh i'm assuming that you're gonna spend
a couple days
uh it is sunday so the next ship you can
get
will leave on thursday wow so you'll
have a couple days to like rest and
relax
in cairo to the extent that you can
ever do that the only thing that i would
do is go back to the
the home of the sword the ex-home of the
sword okay which is now rubble
how do i get slash orphanage how do i
get pal
back do i know how to do that so you
sure do
ah i'm staying well away from you thank
you
me too so none of you has gotten
those of you that lost power none of it
has returned yet
good i like being where the people are
yeah i'll just thor you guys start just
like sucking power from random people
a little tiny bit it's
not how it works really um
uh so are you doing this around anybody
any of the party are you just going off
on your own
i i would love to like go to a big
concert or maybe
if i should go to a church gathering or
or something like that where i i can go
ah i'm better okay
uh sure because that's how i think
about it right sure
yeah no problem um
yeah okay uh
well then you're gonna be going to a
probably a mosque which would be weird
or a coptic church
uh there are several of those so okay
um but so you're gonna have several days
between then between sunday and
thursday
so any wounds that you have will be
healed um
and for
sealing the pyramid
you all get three sanity back okay i was
going to ask about sandy if we could
talk to somebody other than hollister uh
so you yeah for
you feel as if you have you know you
feel as if you've
um you've either done the wrong thing
for the right reasons or the right thing
for the wrong reasons but
i'm definitely going to want to talk to
alexandria
i was about to say exactly the same the
that dude in
in the next few days i want to like sit
down and talk to him and try to sort out
the mess that is my head and i don't
even
want to talk to depending on how things
go
knight of chris oh maybe work out a
ceasefire
or something oh that's a good idea
talking to knight of chris she might
know some stuff
interesting i think that's a terrible
idea
it's just the justice i don't want to
just stay far away what i'm going to say
about that is do not allow joan to be
anywhere nearby
like dinner with knight of this no no i
wasn't going to be in on dr hollister's
thing but maybe i would try to talk to
knight of chris through alex if she lets
alexandria i will tell you this right
now alexandria is very wary of letting
knight of chris
come forward at all because she's very
much afraid that if nada chris comes
forward she can't regain control
and i would be very sympathetic to that
but you know like i said
knowledge is power need we need all the
knowledge we can get
there's there's knowledge and then
there's whatever she is
someone in the chat said they trust
you know what knight whoever said that
you are completely white
um so i think here's what we're gonna do
uh it's 9 30 and i'm old so
we're going to we're going to call
it here
um off camera let's do our skill checks
once we're done we can we can run
through our skill checks and do all that
uh in preparation we'll we'll start out
next
next time not next week but next time uh
we'll start out
with uh
with figuring out sort of what you're
gonna do in those few days
in cairo and what what the
the new children of
egypt are doing uh
that the children of the black that the
army of the black pharaoh was not
um and let's see here i have nidochris
with two hash marks is that correct
yes okay just no reason for that
um no not at all totally also i i want
to talk to you later about what that
means for all of my various skills and
what my and mechanically what that means
but we can do that off camera
sure sure so oh
uh let's see youtube giveaway i didn't
do uh
i don't know i said you know i totally
forgot you didn't do the 80s television
moment ladies tv
uh 80s tv terrible
it's just it's not good there was
a there was a show so
there was like a two hour block i loved
scarecrow and mrs king scarecrow mrs
king is actually a good show
i won't have a word set against it one
of the best soundtracks
ever the the the theme song to scarecrow
and mrs king
is great but also at
in that block on cbs on god i think it
was fridays
was a terrible show called
bring them back alive actually this is
oh gosh this is before scarecrow and mrs
king because this was bruce box lightner
he played oh my god he played a
character
that then he was scarecrowing he was the
he was the scarecrow and scarecrow and
mrs king
but in bring him back alive terrible
show gosh what was it auto man was the
other show i think i've talked about
auto man before but
bring him back alive was a terrible show
about a guy whose only job
was to he was a he
he caught animals in africa for circuses
but somehow every episode oh no tales of
the gold monkey
that's what it was with bring him back
alive tales of the gold monkey was a
great show
but anyway were you on acid as a child
what the hell is going on
well like i just listened to 10 minutes
of free form
weirdness i had about right so i just
watched television that was my
babysitter
um but so bring him back alive terrible
show
youtube for a copy of the call of
cthulhu coloring book
what was the name of the main character
and bring him back alive
he had a terrible name it was one of the
most it was just
a really silly hollywood name i wonder
if thomas knows that one
uh only only one yeah only if
thomas knows what's in ezra's head tales
of the gold monkey was a great show we
have i not done tales of the gold monkey
before i don't think that's a show i
think hale's the gold monkey is a great
show
it was so it was 30s
it was like trying to be south pacific
casablanca
so the main character was this was a
cargo pilot who would fly between these
tiny little islands
in the south pacific and for some reason
the nazis were there
even though the nazis were not big in
the but there was a whole lady
yeah it was the 80s but there was a
whole like uh
semi cthulhu feeling with cargo cults
and
the gold monkey was this idol that was
uh that was like part of the whole
story
uh great show love that anyway we are
