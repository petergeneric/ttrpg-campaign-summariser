you have found yourselves back at your
hotel in cairo
uh you are planning on heading out to
kenya it is
according to my notes it is
june the morning of june 7th and
there is a
boat going in that direction on june 11th
yeah so you have
four days in cairo
that you want to figure out uh
and so yeah last episode don julio
actually successfully performed an
exorcism
and a pillar of salted a number of
people
and the
the the ritual went off fairly
without without a conclusion although it
cost many of you a great deal of power
um uh-oh and there's lucy all right this
will get exciting
um hey lucy and um
you know you probably need to figure out
a way to make those innocent people spin
the power instead of you guys
you know what that would be oh which
isn't unethical at all we did they did
spin the pow
yeah they spent they spent pow and you
they were exhausted after it
yeah yeah one of you was not involved
and pal didn't i was involved oh no in
that regard yes
yes you're right and i couldn't be
involved because i have an evil entity
in the back of my head
it's true or front of my head depending
on what's going on
that's right yeah and so yeah it is
you're gonna have four days to kind of
recuperate and
you know clear up some loose ends uh
uh in cairo um
let's deal we're gonna have a
vignette with each of you here
and let's let's do alexandra first so
alexandra
uh that first morning when you wake up
nidacris says to you um
[Music]
you cannot go to kenya why not
what's in kenya there's no wait for you
there
there's only blood anywhere else what
my husband my king plays games with
riddles
i feel like you should have the word
attempt in there somewhere
you cannot go to kenya kenya is the end
kenya will be the death of
this body oh
good
look with what with what we're doing we
have to go to kenya sooner or later
it's on the way we've been wasting far
too much time so
if you let me i will send you i will
send us
to somewhere where they might be able to
find your body in the ether
but that would require letting you take
control
it's true and i don't know if
it's like letting you have control of
this body is a great way to get myself
booted
out of it without anywhere to go
if i could boot you out of this body i
would have done so already
why
we we have
meritable disagreements from time to
time
i've killed him several times he's
killed me several times
well i'm glad i'm not your marriage
counselor even if i'm stuck in the
middle of this
[Music]
all right yeah so you are resolute and
going to kenya and so that uh
[Music]
you have after the ritual you were
for lack of a better word the um
fantastic sword of Akmala that you were
able to
summon from somewhere has not gone away
so how are you stowing it
this glowing blue blade of
some sort of phantasmic force
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
go back
to the monastery is gone right
yeah okay so i'm going to go back to
i can't remember the muse was it the
museum where cofour
slash clive was and see if i can find
out some more information on the sword
and in order to like carry it on me it's
going to be sheathed constantly
and at least the handle is going to be
wrapped as well so that you don't know
what you know so it might just look like
us you know a stick or a tube or
something like that so the weird part
for you
is it goes in the sheath but like
any movement of it just it slides out so
like
part of it could be sticking out it is
um it is
it seems non-corporeal
okay and you'll you'll learn that the
uh the sword of Akmala is a
ritual device that has throughout the
centuries
been called upon
by by the uh
muslim faiths heroes
to defeat evil
and it is a it's a weapon
that anyone who
uh anyone who is a a
student of certain
less reputable parts of islam would
recognize
ah okay all right so then i know it's
not gonna be easy but
um i then just try and find
yeah it's kind of it's gonna be hard and
i'm sure i may or may not be successful
but i would just
follow up with either like the quran
or in a mosque just asking about any
so a nun is going to walk into a mosque
with a glowing blue sword
kinda i'm i'm and a bottle of booze
uh are you going to uh
so are you going to
um i would ask for references so i would
start
in like in the more appropriate parts of
cairo and then ask for introductions to
work my way that way
um and then just kind of guys it as like
a comparative faith discussion
uh all right yeah so you
find um
yeah you find in one of the the larger
it's a
um it's a mosque close to the university
they will you know they'll they'll sort
of talk with you
in generalities about the sword of
Akmala
and it's you know it's it's sort of like
how we view the the um
the holy grail kind of it's like it's
like a holy grail sort of thing where
you know it pops up throughout history
and
does it's sort of a mcguffin it does
whatever it needs to do in the story
but no one you know it hasn't been seen
in
centuries okay so after i learned that
you're gonna see a little montage scene
of emma like
at night in the courtyard where nobody
else can see her and she's gonna be
doing dumb stuff like see if she'll like
put it down and then see if it comes and
shoots to her hand
um sadly it does not but you don't have
you you're not
getting it where i'm just like i'm like
come here you know and then just doing
other stuff like see if it
like see what the magic like trying to
figure out what the magic of it is right
so right now the only thing you can find
is that the entire thing
is to anything but your touch
non-corporeal
so like you can pick it up like a and it
feels like a physical item
but like it if you try and hit a tree
with it it just goes right through the
tree
got it so it's kind of like a ghost item
there you go got it and then all
right and then i would naturally deduce
that
hopefully it turns into something when i
find something evil
i i i love when you say i would
naturally deduce
yep and then i'm just like then there's
gonna be another scene where i like
sneak into hollister's room and try and
like poke him with the sword and see if
it like moves his skin it slides right
through him
okay he's not evil it like you like you
like go through his neck
you're like once you're like not gonna
hurt him you're like
cute you're you're you know pin
cushioning him
i i really want to know if emma tries it
on alexandria
i thought about it for a second but i
was like i don't think i can kill her
right now
uh all right awfully hard to get through
all 26 hit points in a single
single go all all two personalities in a
single go
that too professor lamb
you make it back um
and first of all you're gonna get a
d10 sanity back because
you have after we did our skill
checks
your archaeology skill i believe it
is is over 90
and so give yourself a d10 sanity
back there
there you go very nice i'm excited
that's epic
how much did you get 10. nice i needed
it
yeah i know i know that feel uh
and so you have a
uh a couple days in
uh in cairo and what are you to do with
them
well i know that i was pretty drained
and i was thinking that you know i
wonder what everybody else said this is
not hurting people just to
take a little a little power so i want
to go to some some like uh
um to some gatherings like in a bar
or or something like that and i'm going
to just
take a little here and take a little
there so i can build myself back up
okay um
i was hoping you won't say that before i
oh you're gonna get some back let's just
see how well you regulate
uh no i did not make it all right what'd
you roll
i rolled a 72 okay so
i'll give you 2d6 you get back five
pow um
and the first time you do this at a cafe
like two people faint
not enough people around it must be i
need a bigger crowd so i can take a
little bit more out of everybody else
this is going to turn into that sleeping
sickness that that neil gaiman used for
sandman
one more one more place like maybe like
a big congregation
they would have extra power right so
you're going to a
mosque because you didn't say you didn't
you didn't want to go to emma's church
uh all right i'm gonna make a secret
what's your pal with the one i did
with the what i just got back
uh
and make me a uh
oh yeah easy okay
hard 38 yes three seven
37. all right you feel like you are
being
followed as you leave the mosque now did
i see any people fall over did anybody
make any look like anybody passed out
this time
okay yeah cause i was really worried
about that
you know but but i figured bigger people
everything like that so but somebody's
following me well
um i'm gonna try to do evade them
all right this is going to be your
no i did not do well
all right everything's fine
i don't see him okay all right i'm gonna
i'm gonna go back to uh
um so that that seemed that seemed to to
work okay but
i i am kind of worried that
maybe i have enough for now so i'm going
to go back
that's the thing is oh man but what
other big
things i could go to i mean i was
thinking maybe i could try to find some
cultists
and drain them but how do you just find
cultists on the street so
the other thing is like draining people
is
it's not like it's not an effective
attack
this takes time like you basically sit
there and you're like
soaking it up over time oh yeah oh yeah
no i
and and and there's no i don't know a
way to go you
right and suck it all out so that yeah
that just
you know trying to hang out with those
people for that long no not gonna happen
but i i do feel
we need this we need this to save the
world we need this to save the world i
keep telling myself that
i love justification one of my favorite
things
um you are in your hotel
and um
a there's a knock at the door of your
room it's about
10 30 at night okay that's a bit late
but
i'll go over and and there's a porter
and a porter says this was left for you
sir and there's an envelope a sealed
envelope
all right thank you very much for
delivering this to me
uh the address on the envelope is the
military base
okay i figure i i made some stops there
before
right i'll close the door and crack it
open all right the envelope just says
look in a mirror at 2 am your time
2 a.m okay i'll set an alarm
all right ed at at 2 am you look in a
mirror
and you the mirror
like waves like water
and you see rogers looking off to the
right
did it work is this thing on yeah i can
hear you
hollister yeah rogers
yeah i i don't we don't know how long
this is going to work
uh we're they're finding our telegrams
we we're we're working this is an
alternate
means of communication that we're
working on um
so far it's going pretty well
okay what do you need to tell me i got
your report
and make sure that they finish this
final mission
they've got you know this this capping
will
if you give me a time frame for when we
should be at gray dragon island i'll
marshall whatever i can there
okay we've made some big strides in mass
okay and for the report should we uh
i'm gonna if i can i'm gonna try and
send you
uh where are you headed now we're
going to kenya
all right when you get to kenya
send me with the fourth encryption
code that we have
send me a location
and i'm gonna send you hopefully the
knowledge
to use this ritual which is the most
reliable forms
and as for the last thing on your report
the knight of chris
situation egypt
is egypt is collapsing
this this revolutionary army
is taking over if
your friend if you're you're leaving
might be the best thing for this because
if your friend
is in the body of their spiritual leader
getting her out of egypt might be our
okay yeah well but
definitely leaving so if if that stops
being your
friend you know what to do
uh and and the water waves again
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay donald
you get back uh
uh from everything that's happened and
you know you
and you and alexander have finally had a
few minutes
a few moments together where it's felt
like
um like a corner was being turned and
you were sort of
i don't know getting back together
getting getting back to
close to where things were um
i imagine well he knows she's in there
there's still going to be a
physical distance and some issues
obviously because of the appearance in
the situation so
right right back to normal so
great point one of my questions for you
are you sleeping with
in that room with her no he's not okay
um so uh
you come you know you you come back from
that experience
uh and you know you're
you're you're starting to
you know you have this sort of dual
feeling of like
we gotta do this thing but i've gotta
you know i have to save
alexandra how do i you know what do i do
and how do i do that
and so your vignette is actually more
a question
like how does that manifest with like
four days of kind of
uh you know four days of kind of
down time which for donald could be
super dangerous
mm-hmm and what i imagine him doing is
spending a lot of time
talking to alexandria as nauticus chris
keeping an
eye on her for the most part a lot of
just his conversation
touching bases is still the same
personality same voice
all that is assuring but keeping an eye
on her
is a lot of in the back of his mind you
know how long will this be alexandria is
it i mean
if she's it's her but how long how long
is that that's the one thing that's
that he doesn't know what to do with you
know how this is permanent is this
temporary
and he doesn't know what to do he has no
idea how to fix this how to change this
who to talk to
who to speak to and alex doesn't know
either or if she knows she won't say
the options are and he'd like to talk to
em at some point but emma's he sees emma
very distracted with
her sword and her muslim studies
so at some point he would open to talk
to her about some catholicism
observations but it's that's a back
burner issue at this point
right in front of him is the problem and
he doesn't know how to solve it and he
doesn't know what to do about it
but it's it's not something he can't let
it go yeah so
these four days are super frustrating
for you and you're just like can we get
on a boat and
you know deal with some things that i
know how to deal with
or just who do we talk to there's
somebody we can talk to what are we
doing here
why are we you know you know yeah so
that's
a lot of that so um
so we'll we'll skip ahead you're you're
gonna be on the boat and on the boat
um dr hollister is going to have a
session
with any of you that want to have a
session with him
um oh i'm aggressively trying to
like i'm making time for alexandria
yeah you can assume that over the
over the four days that we definitely
talked yeah
so between between that
and the ship make me a psychoanalysis
role
uh for alexandra dr hollister
oh oh thank god yes okay that is
only a hard success a hard success all
right
okay oh art seven
very nice all right so thanks to dr
hollister
um and and you know sort of
talking about duality and you know
he he he brings in some some stuff that
he has learned
about multiple personalities and and
how people manage that
sadly it's mostly lithium but but he
he only sort of recommends that you know
several times
um we went over not using uh
amazon anything that could impair her in
any way
but so you're gonna get sick sanity back
from talking with him
and really what what that represents is
um you know you realizing
how inc you realizing that you have
you know sort of he underscores to you
that you have
maintained control and that you know
alexandra has been
the the driving force of this and he
also reinforced you how important it is
that you remain in control
uh all right that's great emma do
you want to
avail yourself of dr hollister's
i'm fine that's terrifying
are you really i am
julio's passing was difficult for you
you had a sort of rivalry or something
yeah that's i consider that a problem
gone
wow and i'm the sociopath of the group
oh man nope i'm fine like i keep saying
i'm going to heaven my soul is fine yeah
i got to talk to hollister at some point
here
yeah yeah absolutely it's better than
drinking at least
and alexandria will absolutely like like
nudge for that like
the two things are not mutually
exclusive
at some point at some point i suspect
you like reach over and take the whiskey
glass out of his hand and be like
the the good doctor is available
uh all right ulster make me another roll
i really want to fumble here oh don't
hurt me i get inspiration
yes
was just a hard success i really want a
that was a 99 oh that
is a full-on amy i'm so sorry no no that
is a full-on
emma emma yeah oh honey
what's the worst advice i could give you
wow
so speaking of things i never thought i
would say
oh and here's here's the thing you know
what
hold on i'm i'm not gonna say this out
loud i'm gonna message you ezra hold on
[Applause]
yeah donald you have some you have
two sessions with dr hollister and he
he really seems you know he seems intent
uh on most of his conversation
is about out is asking questions
about alexandra
he's yeah to you you know he's like hey
what do you think you could do that
would make alex you know he's like
um well actually donald make me a
rush what would make me a psychology
role donald great i gotta i got 23 in
that
let's see if you can a trained
psychotherapist is doing to you all
right
so you have no idea that what
hollister is doing
is trying to manipulate you to keep
alexandra calm
and to keep alexandra in control he he
he like has no so so you know he has
no sense of like this will make donald
feel better instead it's all about like
how can we keep alexandra in check and
here are the changes you need to make in
your life
sure the workout for you but really
he's not explicitly doing that though
he's uh
it's all in in a that's actually what's
happening
yeah it's all covered in a vein of of
psychobabble that you have no idea about
but the underlying
gist of it is like you know you should
really subvert yourself to make sure
that alexandra is
you know why aren't you
i'm sorry i'm awesome oh sorry i didn't
make that roll
set yourself on fire to keep to keep the
rest of the group warm
the transference thing yes that's good
nice he's the doctor i don't know
what the hell
i'm doing that's right yeah sounds
sounds
hey actually donal the help yourself by
helping others think
that feeds into the weird catholic stuff
that you're starting to go through as
well
that's very real that's all real oh yeah
when you and you you say that you're
having like
um you know you sort of offhandedly
joked you're having a crisis of faith
and the problem is you're starting to
have faith like hollister
is all in on that and he's like you know
have you considered what
you know would be better for your
immortal soul and he just like
he starts to like proselytize about
catholicism a little bit
all right well that's what you think
doctor i'll take i'll think about it
find solace in religion i mean with what
uh
all right professor lam uh
are you gonna talk to hollister given
your it's great
relationship oh no um
i'm going to talk to hollister but not
for the reason he thinks i'm going
to talk oh no are you going to siphon
pow off hollister
no because i saw what it did to other
people he is one of our group
but i saw what he did
to my friend and colleague
are you trying to like out psychotherapy
him and like make him
feel guilt for what he's doing yes wow
yes all right because he's a man who did
something bad
so i'm going to make you an offer joan
you can do this is going to be an
opposed role
um but you can decide if it's going to
be opposed
psychology or opposed psychotherapy
oh it's got to be psychology i don't got
any psychotherapy
all right so this is an opposed
psychology role between you and
hollister
you're gonna need a good success for
all right both of you silent ways
like why why
yeah both of you smiled in ways that are
terrifying
i missed it by one i was thinking of
throwing luck in there
but i can't get a hard success because
that's that would be too many
hollister is sobbing
how bad was that roll hold on hold on
nick
no like so do you want to spend the
luck
or yeah i'm going to spend the luck to
make it yes okay all right
holster would you roll i i i i sent it
directly to you check your
i never look oh wow
[Laughter]
wow you critically fumble that uh
so yeah joan you um
you feel like you have masterfully
manipulated hollister
and you know you you bring up
you know the death of clive and that
sort of thing and and
after about unexpectedly actually no
like you don't even get that far
in he he breaks really quick
he's apologizing he's like he's there
that's what i needed that's what i
needed
you know he's he's apologizing for you
know
the anguish that he caused you in in
in you know oh
no he's he's justified he just feels
horrible about it
he's you know he's he's like i had to i
had to and so
like but but but no other way like we
were all going to die everyone was gonna
die the world was gonna die
yeah so you both have this moment where
joan tries to turn it back on you and be
like
and that's exactly why i do the pow
thing i do because otherwise the world's
gonna die don't you understand
and terrifyingly you sort of understand
um although you know in your head you're
like
one person dozens of people
you know you're still you're you still
have some but but she has had some
success in terms of turning that back on
you
and and giving you you know
seeing like if you're justifying why you
had to kill him
you know that same justification could
potentially work for what she's doing as
well
all right i did not i did not anticipate
any of that that is all
very interesting so
you arrive in mombasa the journey takes
if i were a good gm i'd already have
this information
uh but once again
once again just assume there was a
hilarious vignette with the duchess on
board that
uh on board that boat trip that oh we'll
laugh about for years to come
am i rolling psychoanalysis for her as
well do you
put a dinner table together
i'm on fire right now i got i got sanity
back i don't know you guys
you need something yeah did i get any
more sanity back out of that thing with
hollister or just satisfaction
no just satisfaction i'll take it i'll
take it
i'll drop the dice sure all right
yeah sure you're gonna make me do the
voice
there there's the critical success i was
looking for
wow
i'm so sorry
so here's what yeah you have a lot like
it ends up being
like a long discussion in a lounge
like several hours long and um
you know the baroness starts you know
ever since i lost my dear bertram
it's just it's so hard to go on
you mean the duchess right duchess
you are so lucky she's watching a bardic
competition right now and not watching
us
there's a scene you'll find out sooner
or later you're so lucky she's watching
a bardic competent
um i've often said thank goodness for
bardic competitions
i mean they're pretty fun
it's been so hard i've
i haven't fenced since there he passed
and she becomes a quivering
um the word mass is
you know not not really she's just a
quivering
uh get it out of your system get it all
out
thank you so much oh
it's so nice to finally have a friendly
face
i have to tell you that um
the new bedroom he's
he's always in the shadows he appears
out of nowhere
it's terrifying i i think that's just
your mind playing tricks
on you trying to cope with with
everything that you've got on you
um
you you need to here just breathe deeply
very good yes i
um i used to be something of an opera
singer
i was
opera that's you're accomplished
yes well thank you so much you never
reach
it's you sounds like you already had a
large burden on you
it's it's amazing that you're you're
able to hold up with all of that
well it's so nice for someone to
recognize
how difficult it is to be me
no one no one seems to understand
i feel i feel somehow alone
yeah no but no that's that's that's
the human condition everyone everyone
feels that but
you have to get out there and you you
have to try to connect with people
yes yes well
thank you so much young man you're very
you're very kind
have you considered studying psychology
never been that good at it no i noticed
yes
i do what i can a weak chin but a kind
here
what
better a weak chin than no chin
oh god that voice thank you for pulling
it out that made me almost
sob laughing um
but yeah you terrifyingly have you know
you have
you have soothed some of the baroness's
well we'll have another shot donald
um god that was horrible i'm so sorry
i was like i've got it in the bag and
then it's like ugh i'm like five away
uh so while all that was going on dr
paramecium slid the players
500 bits to not politically destabilize
kenya i don't know if that's conditional
or not i don't know
no promises
speaking of which as you are um
as you are the trip will take six days
you're going to get in on june
i want to say yeah 17th right
yeah june 17th as
you are the
the the first newspapers that you see
when you're back
um there is definitely there is
definitely a new government
in place in egypt cairo has fallen
to a revolutionary army uh
and they uh
it appears the the the english have
been
uh have maintained control of the suez
canal
but it's like it's a it's a combat zone
uh where there is active fighting as
this army tries to take the suez canal
back
um and uh
yeah it is things in egypt are no
bueno
something that i realized that was
obvious that we should have done
yeah as to the us military base
would been to have fabricated a new
id
for alexandria since all of my idents
have me as a short white woman
not a tall statuesque black woman can we
let's see so you want to you want to go
that would we'd have the contacts for
doing that there or i would
we knew that fellow the english fellow
from the newspaper the spy guy
i'd rather get english paperwork than
american paperwork for this yeah
yeah yeah kenya is an english in
english colony at this point
but do we have the context for pulling
that off i mean
the context for for having rogers tell
them
do this so you know
i mean wasif is a secret agent yeah he's
amazing
yes you know you potentially yes
who knows he'd have to decide it was in
the interests of great britain to do it
well and
with everything going on with cairo and
everything i think asking for english
help will be a little
tricky you can always ask it's worth a
shot
paperwork than american paperwork well i
mean
they're not mutually exclusive is a
thing i can get the ball rolling on one
and it's probably a sure thing whereas
you you can still try to get the
you can get two ids true keep keep one
um so yeah you will go to the military
base and
uh make me a luck roll dr hollister
that's very good if i could get a
critical success on the left roll i
would have
well there you go all right yeah they'll
um you know they'll sort of
uh they don't even like go to rogers
for
uh go ahead they'll they'll start
working on it
um with that role it'll be ready by the
time before you guys leave so
she'll at least have a u.s passport
yeah um
[Music]
excellent and wasif
um let's make a luck roll for mr wassief
oh dear apparently nigel rasif has
left
town okay
he's he's fleeing before before
things fall apart yeah i don't blame him
and i could theoretically wire back to
madame
in london but there would be a lot of
explanation required and i don't want to
have to make that explanation
so i think i think i stick with it with
an american passport and do my best to
make my voice as american as possible
the other option is of course we spent
some money on an egyptian
passport just give some money to
somebody and then
they take a picture and they document it
they're in egypt as an egyptian citizen
the thing is is that i think the u.s
citizenship has more clout
it's easier the four is the egyptian
one and there's no way they can't check
it
they cut it and collapse at some point
so the u.s passport goes a lot of places
i'm i'm going to vote the u.s passport
it's going to be our best option right
now us passport had definitely has
pluses and minuses
is it that's the way with any passport
really
so you arrive in mombasa kenya
uh it is a low-lying uh
a port town you know that you want to
head to nairobi which is going to be a
train trip
uh to get there into the into the
mountains
uh so let's let's let's go over
briefly
um we for for our viewing audience
um let's go over briefly some of your uh
uh some of the things that you want to
hit in kenya you you have
uh you know jackson elias was previously
here
as was the carlisle expedition um
and you know from
uh brady that this is actually where he
grabbed
carlisle and fled from
so i'm waiting for
uh information from rogers on how to
seal this particular area how long are
we staying here
in mombasa you're probably gonna not be
you might not even stay the night
um the train to nairobi will you'll
probably get on the train tonight
and unless there's something you really
want to do in mombasa
you're probably mom boss is a larger
city so if you want to do shopping or
something it's probably better to do it
here
uh nairobi is um
up but it's it's closer to the area that
you're you know
where you think so the big things you
um nairobi is where jackson elias went
uh it's where
a lot of the colonial government is
which is a big thing to look into
um and it's um
it's where it's where most of the the uh
uh the white population of this this
neck of the woods is
uh so you you know you know from the
notes of jackson elias you have
like you have some names of folks who uh
um the guys who actually found the the
english soldiers who found the bodies
um you have the names of uh
i think let's see here
um you have the name of like a
politician uh
johnstone kenyatta you have um
[Music]
uh the colonial under secretary for
internal affairs roger corydon
um you have uh
a list of names that he questioned of
various people um
and you have uh
you also have the name nails nelson a
mercenary
that he ran into there
and mark selkirk and yeah you've got
yeah
that's right mark selkirk is the the
soldier he was the lieutenant who
who led everything and you know that
somewhere
there's so there's a number of mountains
like you on the boat will look
at you know you look at a map
of kenya and there's a bunch of
different mountains
all all along there none of them
unfortunately are called the mountain of
the what is it the mountain of the
bloody tongue
um which is what you're where you're
supposed to
where you probably shouldn't go but
where you're gonna go any where you
you're thinking about going um
you know none of them are there's also
no like you know you do the
you're able to do the sort of
superficial research of
none of them are that in french none of
them are that in swahili you know
there's there's no
like uh nothing like that
does do we have the rough idea of the
x's that emma saw
on the map when at the dark pharaoh to
kind of like narrow down like it's
probably in this area
that's good well that narrows it down
from a whole nation at least
right yeah eldebrad
uh is sending the players 500 bits to
burn down kenya
no problem can you narrow it down
to like us that's a lot of work it is
it's a lot of yeah it's a lot of force
it's summer in africa i feel like and
it's near the
it's near the equator i feel like we
could probably you know set a good grass
fire and just walk away
so as you arrive in mombasa customs
is super lacks they don't even search
your stuff
um actually only knight of chris's stuff
nothing else is and they like
when when you present your they look you
and they go like
and an american uh
so the rest of you are do you all
have us passports
i have a british passport yes donald has
british the rest you have us
so all of you with u.s passports get a
one month visa
any donald you have you can stay here
as long as you want
and i think emma and joan have the
passwords donald got for them i believe
because he got a bunch of really good
fakes in london that's right
english yeah but i think those were
american
because i didn't want to deal with it
jones would have been yeah i said there
would have been
might want to deal with accents yeah
um you could try one
yeah so yeah you
you everyone except donal has a one
month
uh visa although you know it's not like
they're going to track you down and kick
you out
um they're they're you know they're very
like
oh good tourists you know american
tourists
it's okay we don't have that many days
six months six months
um and you uh
you know you're you're here in mombasa
there is a train
to nairobi that will leave it's
supposed to get you to nairobi
at 10 pm it'll leave it'll leave here
at 2 p.m and it's about noon now
and the the shipping line will just take
your bags to if you want will take your
bags directly to the train
so here's a good place to buy supplies
right
i mean mainly just non-perishable
food
water and then i it doesn't look like
they would have any
native attire here if we need to try to
disguise ourselves
uh hold on though doctor let's go to not
really first then talk to people
before we actually leave the city i'm
not going anywhere until we know how
we're going
and nairobi you know they'll
they'll they'll tell you that nairobi is
a safari town so like
supplies and stuff are easy to get there
okay
yeah and i i would have gotten a couple
sets of clothes in cairo
but i would have spent most of the four
days just hiding because i didn't want
to be night of chris on the street
um so i definitely want to get clothes
here
because knight of chris is a foot taller
than alexandria
yeah yeah so you can buy a couple
outfits in mombasa
um their stuff the in mombasa it's a
little more
uh arab influence
uh so a lot of like flowing gowns and
robes and
you know coverings and that sort of
thing
um and and like you know neither chris
is still just like neither is not you
hmm yeah i'm monitoring that part of my
brain pretty carefully like if i seem
distracted to people
it's because i'm just watching you
haven't mentioned any of the stuff she
said to you today
nope not a chance in hell
like the only person i might have
mentioned it to is hollister and only
because
he's been digging at nidakras
um do you want to decide that or do you
i'll decide that she told him that that
night of chris was afraid to be here
okay well that just makes sense i think
we're all afraid to be here
so no like
she she she believes that we are all
going to die
that this body is going to die that the
she said the beast
deals in blood her husband deals in
riddles and games and the beast deals in
blood
so we brought those rifles with us right
all right
rifles pistols daggers all of that of
course we did
robar come on of course crowbar
uh i mean i don't know a part of me
thinks that she just fully appreciates
what we're going up against
there was something very specific about
kenya
well
i'm gonna state the obvious but we'll
we'll have to stay on our guard
if we if we teach trouble we can back
away and assess
i am never not on my guard with this
me alone that guy i'd i'd rather not
talk about that
it's important to maintain your
relationships and
i'm just going to leave that alone
um so alexandra one thing you will
notice
is that this place is super stratified
like there are whites only places
there are so when you go to buy clothes
you know you're going to
specific you you know you end up in
specific areas
um you reflexively you know a few times
you walk in the wrong thing or something
like that
and you are politely but firmly
you know sent in another direction um
usually with an implication that you're
really dumb
and they're like you know um
and so you're you're getting a
sense for that and that only
heightens when you go to buy the train
tickets
and the only car so there are
uh there's first class and second
class which are white only
then there's third class which is rich
black and brown
and then there's fourth class which is
lying on a you know a wagon car
um they will not let white people by
third or fourth class
and they will not let you alexandra buy
first or second class
yeah and by the time that i've gotten to
the point of actually buying the ticket
i'm on a knife's edge of just this
rage are you going to do third class
or fourth class
probably third i don't want to be lame
yeah so you'll be sitting on like a
in terms of making some sort of
exception uh
because oh no that is not that is not
from a medical standpoint like i need to
be there if i can say like she has a
condition that i have to observe you
could be risking her life you
have to make an exception for me to be
there
this could be life or death who is
this woman
uh and i is she like a princess or
something
and i just look at him and like with a
little bit of knight of chris in her
eyes just like
begging your pardon sir but it's just i
let it go hollister it's not that long
i'll walk away are the rest of you going
first class or second class
i need to conserve money i was going to
go second yeah i was like
what i mean you gave the ten thou back
so yeah what that wasn't our money
very true it's very true accurate okay
so yeah anybody who wants to go first
class should make me a credit rating
role
well i want to but oh i actually didn't
make it
i guess it's so yeah so so you're a
little short
of first class ticket money right now in
the pocket so you uh
oh i did actually make it what do you
know
if you want to go first class you can
emma
all right emma sitting up in her own
outstanding i put my sword next to me
like nobody can you know how you put
your book bag on a chair next to you
that's exactly what's happening i'll be
like and this is for my sword
you're in first class they don't care
they're not even like you know
they'll be like
and would your sword like a drink madam
it would
it had like a double this is
double-edged right yeah
so the train is
uh the engine then the flat car with
fourth class
then third class then the dining car
then second class then first class we're
not even next to third class
no no they don't want they're not going
to let them walk through to go to dinner
in fact they actually will change
the silverware between the dining of
first and second class and third class
and fourth class doesn't even dine
fourth class is like sitting out
under they're closest to the engine so
they're getting most of the smoke
first class is farthest from the engine
so they're getting a
relatively unobstructed move there's
one
car of each class and they are
um third third clap only fourth class is
like
jammed to the gills like people hanging
off the train
third class is full second class is
comfortable
um and first class is very nice
in third class alexandra make me a spot
okay
uh 50. okay
um so about
about three hours into the into the
train ride
as the um
as the train starts to like go start to
make the incline up
um and and slow down
some you
here uh
you hear what's i mean i mean you've
heard it before you hear
you think you hear chanting somewhere in
here just very quiet
very under your under the breath
i'm going to look up and look around
casually trying to spot where that's
okay would you like to make a cthulhu
mythos roll
the fact that you're offering cthulhu
amita specifically means this is
something i need to be aware of
so that means you don't have to check it
off right well you don't check it
through amitos anyway
oh no but if you make it they know
there's no there's no
there's no no check mark next to cthulhu
methods no but i mean ezra
is generally mean and yeah oh no i have
to i have to add a hash mark to the
knight of chris
yeah so um
nidaker says someone is summoning
something
you know what i can't i can't really
hear
i'm gonna like triangulate where that
sound is coming from and casually
like step a little bit closer okay um
make a listen roll okay
why is my listen better than my spot
hidden
interesting 85 on the nose the music
is 85. yes my list is 85.
uh so yeah you you
even though there's a this this is a
cacophony in this thing and there you
know there are chickens
there are people squabbling
that sort of thing
um you're able to see a small
um possibly indian maybe
a southeast asian woman uh
um who
is like almost like a rosary is just
like say
is like kind of nodding her head and
like doing this chant
and playing with some something in her
hands
is there anywhere near her to sit down
uh make me a luck role
uh 14 that's a hard success sure
yeah okay yeah
oh i'll spot her and
see the empty spot that's relatively
close to her i imagine and i'm going to
go and just
casually move and sit next to her or
near her
so that knight occurs can get a better a
better
beat on what's going on yeah it's
it's a it's a ritual of summoning that's
oh it's happened what
oh did lucy i was like wait wait what
are you talking about no it happened
yeah i was trying to piece it together
then you look back and i'm like oh cats
i was staring up at this screen like
this is new it took him longer than i
expected
uh he was probably eating yeah so
this person is just lying that is like
not even paying attention to you and and
and it's just like
um you know and she's like but the weird
part is it's
it's almost like the person like they
just keep saying it over and over it's
almost like a
a prayer or a wish it's not actually
like a
ritual i'll
like lean over and tap her on the
shoulder
all right she looks up like and
doesn't conceal like the don't touch me
anger
just watching her with a very calm
okay
ought to critical this woman recognizes
you
ooh
i'll look at her and say whatever you
are summoning you probably shouldn't
[Music]
i have work to do
i heard about egypt i'm sure everyone
it was the right time enough had
happened and it was time to move on
do you know who was on this train
who them
yes
no i'm not they are on this train
i have many enemies you'll have to be
who are you i am as you see
that's not an answer who are you
you're not giving me any answers why am
whatever you are summoning stop i have
plans
your plans are for egypt
be that as it may i am also on this
train
and does know you are here
unlikely
[Laughter]
play stupid games win stupid prizes you
have this is my last warning
all right so you're just gonna stab a
woman
on the train is
is is no
my intimidate score is awful
make the roll after you've stabbed her
[Laughter]
i would give you a bonus die to
intimidation after you know
after a stabbing no no i'm not going to
stab her i'm
sitting here i'm sitting fairly close to
her i
actually have the fingernail attack so i
would like reach over casually like i'm
about to touch your shoulder and like
and she will immediately jump up and go
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stabbed me
i'm like and still like
bring out the blood and a porter will
come over
and and that's when you learn a
little bit something about the standing
of casts
white indian black
good to know all right well then i end
up back and forth
in fourth class this will be fun they
yeah they will
uh bodily take you back there as you
leave
she smirks and starts chanting again and
just just just smile and let night
because that chris is still a little bit
forward
do do one of the one of the gestures to
the beginning of a spell
since that's uh
are you going to let knight chris do
that
well i let her forward with the cthulhu
mythos i imagine she hasn't retreated
very far
you can imagine all you want you don't
know how this works
fair are you going to let knight of
chris start to gesture to make a spell
no all right
so you get sent back to fourth class
and this person starts chanting again
and nidakris will tell you she has no
idea who that person is
why does she know you
she recognized you instantly i'm a
goddess
whippedy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do people still have to
was the woman who was with the carlisle
expedition
but benay yes benay is
her pretend like i'm an english person
name
oh well useful to know
she must run the cult here and she's
still alive
she's summoning something and she
clearly knows that your friends are
on this train i know
i'm aware there's not much i can do why
did you stab her
you're not good at this hmm
i'm just like sit like lean back against
whatever i can find at lean against and
close my eyes just ignoring her
you gave her blood
gave her her own if she if she was going
to use her own the best kind for blood
magic
well then why the hell didn't she cut a
finger and use her own
if she was so damn she's on a train
around
people because she's good at this she
knows that you can't do
magic in public and make it look like
magic
i'm not a caster i don't play this game
[Music]
you need to start playing any game or
you should just let me take over not a
none of that would have happened we'd be
sitting on a bench
yes because that's so much better than
sitting where we are
uh i don't like smog
um so that'll you know
you guys will bicker for hours oh
probably
everybody on let's see first
everybody in second class make me a luck
roll
okay
got half all right everybody who made
the
so joan about its darkness has fallen
and
uh you're coming back from dinner and
um you would swear that
out one of the out one of the the
windows
of the train as you're walking by like
a there was like a ball of light
briefly hmm
that seemed to be moving with the train
oh not like ball lightning or something
like that like something that was i mean
who knows but it was brief and then it
hmm out of sight yeah well i would i
would mention it
because we are need to be on our lookout
for
weird things happening so i'll mention
it
to donald and hollister
what did you see which side what
so on the right side of the train uh
jones says she saw like a ball of light
briefly yeah looked like i was with the
train and then
was gone okay well what does that
mean i don't know but i wanted to make
sure we've got to be
we've got to be up we've got to be
looking for things we've got to make
sure that anything weird we all tell
each other about
i'm just going to look at the look out
the window
yeah so in in second class the
windows open
so you know you pull the windows out and
you're looking around and you don't see
any balls of light is it daytime or
night time it is night okay
so i would have seen this i think if
there was something out there no no no
no it was brief
it it came and it was gone maybe
uh like there was a sign with a
reflective surface
light hit it just as we went by you said
out in the middle of nowhere right
i mean i don't see anything out there
john i don't know what you're looking
for what am i looking for
all right we can't see it now but beyond
just be aware that
there are things there's weird stuff out
here just be aware
there's not like a jungle out there or
something other than the savannah where
are we actually
there's a bunch of cultists too you're
you're heading up an
incline are we in the jungle terrain or
what's the terrain
um kenya the flat part of kenya is
mainly grassland
but now you're heading up into the
mountains um
um you're you're actually going from
almost sea level to 6 000 feet
uh where nairobi is so you're you're
you're a pretty healthy incline all
right just just be aware just be aware
all right nothing to look for but yeah
fine fine yes
all right fourth class you
uh are outside and um
uh forty-one find it okay make me a spot
hidden roll
okay what three
all right so you clearly see
a ball of blue flame
zip along the train and
like go out of your sight up past third
class
okay what are the cars of the train like
are they are they the sort of thing that
i could get on top of the train car and
like travel along the top of it to find
second class so there is a there is a
porter
whose only job is to make sure that
people in fourth class
don't leave fourth class so he's
basically like
standing at the door of the fourth class
train like just
you're pretty sure climbing up the train
how fast is the train going at an
incline
uh it's not going that fast but it's
faster than
you know like you don't want to get off
the if you get off the train the train
will leave you quickly
okay
all right i am aware that this is
probably what that woman was summoning
and i mean process of elimination it
seems fairly simple so
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is it just the one porter yep
there's just one
one one guy bored
okay i'll get up
and stretch a bit and as and uh
then like saunter over to him to be
casual
very you know studied casualness and
you're gonna have to open the door to
the third class car
to to to talk to him
is he between the cars i'm trying to
picture this so
the fourth class car is just an open uh
wagon
the third class car which is connected
to the fourth class car
is a close is a sealed car train so
you'll you'll you'll you'll step over
onto a small balcony and there'll be a
door there and that door has a window in
it and just
sitting in the window is this bored guy
okay um
that being the case so i'd have to open
the door in order to get to him
yes would it be possible then to
like shift up and get below his
his line of sight and and come come
as long as nobody else you know as long
i mean there's a bunch of other people
in fourth class who might wonder what
you're doing
sure but as long as they don't go
yelling firm for what for whatever's
going on
i mean you can so it's it's going to
be
fairly easy for him not to see so you
can
make a stealth roll and you'll have
advantage
for rolling against that guy and then
it'll just be a straight stealth role
against
everybody on the since a lot of people
are sleeping or just like not you know
so sleeping or bored and it's dark
yeah yeah so let's do the opposed role
versus the guy who's act
who's semi-actively watching you have an
advantage die on this
okay
31. yeah you he he doesn't he's
reading a magazine okay thank you bird
uh-huh thank you birds of paradise so
now against the people in the
in the fourth class
uh so can i spend a point of luck to
make that even
well you have to beat it ah and two
points of luck to make it a zero
i don't think that's a thing i'm sure
that's how math works
that's how math works it's not how dice
work so
you hear somebody say something in
african
as you duck around the side of the train
and you are now so you're going to try
climbing
along the windows of the third class car
my idea
i'm not a spider my idea was it was to
climb up to the to the roof
of the car and then like stay stay low
and move and move up toward the
the car of the second class and try to
keep eyes out for that light bulb
thing
okay so sure yeah you climb up on the
roof
um and from the roof you have an
excellent view
of that light ball thing setting the
kitchen caught the the dining car
on blazing fire it is like
it is it basically is just planted on
the roof and the entire dining car the
roof of it is like starting to buckle
and melt
and like the the the fumes and the
flames are starting to spring
and i think starting a fire is a great
time to go to break
the the car was on fire and it wasn't
our fault
uh it's our fault yeah
so we will be back just as soon as uh
six people can use six bathrooms





















a train was catching on fire potentially
so we're gonna go into initiatives um
but before we go into initiatives one
last thing
that ball of flame despite
not seeming to have facial features or
anything like that
looks at directly at you it like
turns to you and for just a second you
see
flame
uh all right there you go
[Laughter]
actually you know what since it's just
you tiana we won't go into initiative
yet
um so until until the award the
the warning is raised the rest of you
are just sort of blissfully enjoying
your
your time i will make a roll every round
um so tiana what are you doing okay um
how far away am i from the burning roof
at this point
it's it's so you're on top you
just got to the top
of the third class car so it's the
entire third class car
so call it i don't know 150 feet
and then the middle of the dining car
so another 70 feet so you're about 220
feet away
okay i'm going to start making my way
towards that
carefully because we're on an incline
and i don't want to slip and fall it's
true that definitely slows you down a
little
mm-hmm am i going up or down
to get to the dining car i'm trying to
picture it because the fourth class is
the closest to the end down
down which is in some ways even more
dangerous
yeah i know when when i was going hiking
this last week i preferred going up to
going down going down you slip and fall
it's awful
and you're you're just but
unless as long as you're going at a
careful speed you don't need to make any
rolls you just start to move towards it
so inlet but at the speed that you're
going
you feel like you know you're not going
to be in time to
the the the sec the dining car will be
on fire
okay
then i'll move a bit faster i i i want
to get there before
it is impossible to stop the fire so it
seems like this thing is sinking down
into like through the roof as it's
i don't have any good ideas for this my
my my best idea for this is like take
off a jacket and wrap it around it and
throw it off the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] car but that's
about as good as i've got
i don't think a knife will do much
against fire honestly what i was talking
about from moving quickly
on the top of the fair point no i
what i want to do is like move
move low and like keep a hand on on
the the roof of the train
so that if i slip i have something to
grab for okay
um you're not gonna so you're not
gonna fall off the train or anything
like that but
make me a dex roll and this will just
tell us like how noisy
uh 47 out of 65 okay yeah
you feel like you know i mean there are
probably like
unavoidable like footsteps
like you know there's no like crun bam
boom you know there's not huge amounts
of noise
right uh
and you so
yeah you make it about half the way
through this train
i'll roll for this thing all right
uh oh wow so um
like you can start to feel the heat
emanating from this thing
even from where you are okay this is a
this is a ball of plasma
it is you know this is not like this is
not oh
oh it's on fire this is you know like
um sensing that and sensing that getting
much closer is probably going to be
fairly dangerous with how hot that is
already
um i'm going to regret this
i'm going to reach for the nidacres part
of my brain and ask is there anything
you can do
some sort of fire spirit is there
i could try some
i could try a banishment ritual i
don't have
the materials i need what do you need
if i let you use mine are you going to
try to take over
yours you know what i mean
no i don't what do you mean whose body
is this
search yourself alexandria this is your
chance
it's mine anyway
look we'll be stuck out in the middle of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kenya if
if if this gets set on fire and it's a
so if you don't want your body
experiencing a great deal of wear and
tear
[Music]
very well give me control
all right all right so
i'm going to make you an offer i hate
i will wipe out every hash mark you have
on knightochris and i will have
i'll decide what she's gonna do okay or
you'll keep the marks and you'll add one
and you'll essentially have veto power
i want i want veto power so i'll add a
hash mark to that
i'm currently at four you sure are
okay so nidacres starts moving a
lot faster
uh and nidacres gets to the edge of the
third class car
uh and you can feel the heat emanating
from this thing
um and she
she lunges down to the landing
rips open the door pulls the guy out and
just
and is gonna kill him
there's like a poor porter right there
do i see any other porters in
in immediate line of sight
uh no then i'll let her do it
oh good 28. you're surprisingly okay
with this
this is me you're criticizing
her knife work seriously like like i'm
like
stilettos are not slashing weapons
they're stabbing weapons no there's
no knife involved
she grabs the guy and kills him.
covers her hand in it and she starts
chanting
okay and i'm just i'm i'm watching
intently
but i'm standing back and letting her
[Music]
um
she seems to be struggling with whatever
do we use inspiration
[Laughter]
wow all right you give knight chris
inspiration
yeah that's a sentence i never thought
i'd say outstanding
wow i guess i have to put nidachris on
the emma board oh
no you critically no no oh sorry the amy
board
um all right so yeah
she is struggling with this
um this banishment thing um
she is and and it's clear that this
is like she is she is focusing intently
on this and not really paying attention
um everybody in first and second class
notices that the train
is like jerking to a halt this is like
uh and in first class a very nice porter
uh is walking down the row of
of the little uh
the little cabins and it's just saying
up bag pardon
my stop there's been a small maintenance
issue it'll
we'll be going again shortly please stay
in your cabins
we'll be bringing around champagne
shortly
awesome
uh in second class you are all
um so you're you're sitting in like
nicer you're sitting in chairs you know
in sort of upholstered chairs it's
it's it's not benches um
but the you know the train definitely
lurches
as it's stopping and you get like bumped
forward a little bit
um and you see a porter
uh run the length of the car
from the front of the second class car
all the way to the back of the car and
he starts having
a a huddled quiet discussion with the
porter
uh at the other end back out the window
we're looking back out the window where
jones saw all right yeah you got you
you so you're staring out the window uh
donald what are you doing
i'm gonna listen on the conversation
behind me okay and joan what are you
doing
well actually i was going to try to look
through the cars to see because if he
ran all the way to the back
what's going on back there so i was kind
of looking through it when you get up to
this
when so he ran out of the out of your
sight because the bathroom
like it's not like a wide open there's
like a bathroom
at where the door is and then there's
like a turn and the door is there so
all right then i'm gonna go to the
restroom all right so you two get up
and you're gonna head back towards the
conversation uh
um you'll get there just in time to hear
uh one guy say
just tell everyone to stay calm
and then you hear the door the the train
door cl uh
close and um
and you come actually you you
i guess one of you goes in the bathroom
and donald you're just standing there
i'm just standing standing nearby are
you gonna be in sight of the porter
yeah sure okay so when he can see you
he'll say
uh i'm terribly sorry sir but if you
wouldn't mind returning to your seat
we're having a minor maintenance issue
uh it should be just fine to try and
stop i'm going to use the restroom when
it's
ladies well we don't know when we're
going to be starting up again so if you
don't mind just having a seat
please well i'll go in a few minutes
thank you
uh so he's gonna like polite he's very
politely in that way that the only the
english can
like trying to hurt you and you're
like
trying to obfuscate him and that sort of
thing i'll be i'll be just fine i'm
right here
train's not moving fella just tell the
other passengers do your job
so i'm gonna have to insist i'm terribly
sorry i'm gonna have to insist on you
return to your seat
yeah i'll be fine fella can't wait uh
donald make me intimidate
oh well no this you're you're he's
you're not i'm not worried about that
you know you're not going to move this
guy i'm trying to think of um
you don't even make meryl you smell
and hollister looking back um
you definitely see like a um
um so you're looking
you're actually looking up towards the
front of the train
and it seems like so the train is
stopped
but it seems like there's still smoke
a quick quick question are we right next
to the dining car is that the next
door yeah the door that he is guarding
uh and so joan you're in the restroom
yeah i was gonna see if there was a
window in there i could like you know
take a look outside from the window you
look back and again you see
smoke even though the train has stopped
but i don't see the blue
ball or anything do not see the blue
ball i do see smoke okay
all right then i'm all right then i will
i will i will go out and
all right so i think we're going to go
into initiatives for everyone but emma
here
it's not smoke right it's a steam stack
isn't it so no it is burning this
it is definitely a i mean it's it's
i mean it's steam but yeah so this
smells different that is a good point
this is this is a different this
doesn't have
this this is a different burning smell
i'll i'll come out i'll get donald we'll
go let's let's go back to our seat let's
okay i'm going to
set a little timer here okay
uh so nine um
90s 80s donald
all right so am i at the front of the
car which is right
next to the dining car or that's right
you're at the door
right by the dining car looking through
to the dining car do i see anything
through the two doors
so there are on both sides there's a
little curtain pulled down
okay all right but i smell something
burning but really i have no idea
what's going on it definitely doesn't
smell like the train normally smells
but i mean maybe that's the maintenance
problem
all right at this point i mean i can't
see him doing anything he hasn't he
doesn't really know to go into the
dining cart and know what to do
um i think he's going to wait and pay
attention and
just delay until something becomes
apparent
that you've actually make me a
psychology role oh sure
that's a 30 which is a failure all right
well
this guy the guy who is trying to get
you to go back to seat
hold on fella what's the problem it's
a minor maintenance issue sir if you'll
just go back to your seat we'll
we'll be going again shortly hold on why
what's the problem with the train are
you a mechanic sir
oh yes i am a mechanic you're a mechanic
yes can you tell i look like a mechanic
well it's i don't i'm not a
mechanic i don't know what the problem
is but
you know who does know the engineer
who can fix it so we're going to let him
uh so you two continue bickering that
was 80s 70s alexandra
i'm actually 65 now oh right throws
everything off

to chris she's gonna keep chanting cool
is there anything that i can do to give
her an advantage die on this
um
i'm trying to help there's no advantage
dice
i don't remember what it is in call of
cthulhu all right the bonus die
fine bonus time um
she will very curtly because she's quite
busy
all right
because there's nothing that i i know
there is nothing that i can do about
this fire spirit stabbing isn't going to
help anything
if we're going to survive this it's
going to be on her okay
i hate this and i still keep all the
check marks damn
uh all right so uh
i will give her a bonus die on this roll
then
okay she starts chanting a little
louder
um let's see here make me a luck roll
34 success no problem all right that
was 60s
50s 40s
to race between hollister and emma on a
on a very low initiative emma drink
finally gets her champagne hollister
what are you doing
uh you see model and joan coming back
no i don't i'm i'm pulling i'm pulling
myself further out the window to see if
i can
uh see what's going on where the smoke
is coming from like a size
roll
jeezy uh
hard success wow all right yeah you're
like
you know you're like an acrobat you are
like shimmying you're now out the window
up to your waist
and you are pretty sure that there's a
fire of some sort up
oh oh yeah okay i'll swing back in
okay and and they're they're showing up
yeah they are coming back
what do you say doctor there's a fire
something's on fire is it third class
is third class on fire
so you guys have just said fire like
five
times all three of you make me luck
rolls
oh my god i was trying to be quiet but
these guys you know my gosh
22. that's a four i rolled a four
i'm gonna be a hard successor 22. i'm
the one who's
so i deserve all the luck rule
um no donald also was like so it's on
fire yeah those guys now i was trying to
be quiet but no
but you didn't say anything so i don't
know why you're rolling you're rolling
uh so you hear
you hear someone go did is there a fire
it's i said tire it's a tire they're
replacing the tire
and i pick up my the jacket that has my
wait are you brandishing a gun no it's
it's wrapped up
oh okay um
okay and i hope they don't realize
that trains don't
have tires oh wow he rolls
not well he says oh well all right
yeah he points up all right we are
back to top of the lineup
so donald let me just uh
change the clock there all right all
right there's
still a guy guarding the door between
ours and the next car over right
it's true all right look at the
doctor
and someone is are we going
we're going all right she's she's uh
she's over there it could be
all right we're going that's we'll get
up is joan coming with us um
no i'm going to do something over on
this side that will make the guy run
over
okay so then the doctor and i will
very casually hit
into the aisle and start walking back
towards the
i'm in a dining car yeah and when it's
my turn i'm going to throw an entire fit
i'm just going to throw a fit
okay oh you're letting your inner karen
out
okay that was 80s
uh 65 this time this time nidacris
will go first
all right she like um
you feel her release some sort of energy
and you feel like elation in her
and you see her take those
and she's like she is feeling herself
right now
okay joan you start throwing a fit
i'm like like i can't believe it we're
sitting here in the middle
and i'm just doing the jersey thing you
know
okay offer me a roll
for that let's see what would be
i'm thinking ah
it's not like fighting it's more like
this is probably going to be either a
persuasion
that's outside persuade persuade i'm
going to persuade the guy to come down
yeah oh god
thirteen so you know so
he's like oh dear a woman's in trouble
yes
you will this is critical he will um
he will walk past the two of you and
he'll say excuse me gentlemen i just
need to
quiet this woman down here and he comes
over and he's like ma'am if you don't
mind please
uh we're gonna be moving as quickly as
we he he like you have distracted him
completely
can't believe you oh my god i can't
believe this is happening
and i take off my hat and her hair is a
different color than it was
it's almost like she's gotten younger or
something
uh yeah so you will start doing that
okay um
and he is like totally trying to placate
you and quiet you and all this stuff
uh that was uh
and you and so you two are at the door
and
uh next round you can you can do some
stuff
slip it open and slip on in quietly all
right
uh i will change that following his
slipping because he's
but we'll see how that goes uh
uh alexandra make me another luck roll
okay
uh 44. okay and that made it okay good i
made it
early but it made it so donald and
hollister you both
um you're just going in right
yeah you open the door for our car the
other intermediate so you open the door
and you are now outside it is
a hot humid night but there is the
unmistakable feel
of what is becoming a raging
conflagration in the dining car
a dining car is like when you get the
door is hot to the touch
of the dining car all right i think i
take my jacket off as well
okay and use that to open the door and
slide it open
so you're going into the dining car yes
opening stopped it stopped we can go
around
i'm gonna open the door first okay you
open the door and just
a wall of heat comes out
um and you you almo you actually hear
like a
i'm like no just release the door let it
slide back shut all right yeah
um yeah hop down and go around
all right i mean the train is stopping
we're gonna have to jump around and go
we're gonna get quite easy to do so yeah
so you open
you open the door while hollister hops
down hollister make me a spot hidden
roll
um
ha ha i wasn't expecting the thing to
get banished
so yeah you have jumped off the train
you are joan you are still
distracting this poor guy who is
and oh donald when you opened the
door
you saw a porter with like a
pump fire extinct a pump like water fire
extinguisher
like vainly trying to like put this fire
out
and that's like all you could see
basically past that
the middle of the dining car was just a
wall of flame
got it yeah so i'm hopping off and
following hollister we're going around
the side of the train
so you both come around and you see
knight across standing there holding a
dead porter
like his neck lolling back at an like
with an open spot where like his head
should not be his head should be more
attached um
and her hand and her mouth covered in
blood
and she has like a wild look in her eyes
i mean that could that could still be
i mean i haven't i haven't seen that i
haven't seen that
before yet no no that's not
that's not what she will i'm gonna i'm
gonna do
psychoanalysis like i've never done
psychoanalysis before
uh what are you trying to do here i'm
i'm gonna try to
but i'm gonna try to reach her
i think maybe alexandria her and not the
night of christmas
i mean if nidochrist wants to yield
control i can talk her into that but
that's that's a skill i'm not so good at
i'm going to try to to talk to
alexandria
and convince her to so
like 10 seconds before i do something uh
so
uh this is going to be you're going to
have a
a a a penalty die on this role
um because alexander gave up control
uh total control why i don't know that
but yeah yeah yeah
um gosh
okay and yeah so you just start like
you're you know you you sort of laid
some groundwork with the stuff you did
on the boat and so you like try to go
back to that
uh make me you can control it
so okay yeah is that a good hard
success
one if not for the other dice wow
so that's why i was looking you know i
was like
[Music]
all right so so nidacross looks at
you
and says as i was saving you you fool
and then alexandra you're back in
control
i've got my jacket out i'm holding my
jacket i'm waiting to see
did i have enough time to get the thing
damn it now throw it and throw it and
throw the body off to the side and like
wipe my nails on my pant on my on my
leg all right make me a luck roll
and i lean back to the donald is that is
that that's an alexandria thing
wait 36 made it okay
uh i took an uneasy step towards naughty
chris
all right as you take an uneasy step
forward you hear
a familiar voice to alexandra but not to
you two
you hear a woman say oh my god she
started a fire
and she killed a porter
who is this woman i'm going to kill her
and that and and like you you actually
say that and you look back
and that indian woman is just smiling at
you as she like screams
that and i i i don't even
pause i just i i draw one of the daggers
and and move toward her and just like
so she's behind the door you're gonna
need to like open the door to the car
and go in
is she in the in the dining car no she's
in the third class
okay
now that's definitely alexandria right
just like not even pause like drawing a
dagger and moving and it's like yeah no
anyone who knows her will recognize that
movement
um you've got blood on your face
thanks disgrace all right um
let's follow her so yeah you will
bur you like tear the door open and
um the indian woman goes before
you and she runs back into the third
class car
screaming she's mad she started a fire
and killed a porter
she's ma and she stabbed me earlier
she's mad
are you chasing her into the car i'm
stalking her at this point i
knife knife slightly behind me just like
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you everyone in the third class car
sees this woman run down the aisle
and then sees another woman just like
walking forward purposefully
covered in blood with a knife
um all right i'm gonna this will be
let's make
um and you two are gonna follow her we
have to follow her
yeah we we have to okay so you two go in
all right so alexander this is gonna be
an opposed decks roll between you two
okay
[Laughter]
hot one that's better than mine
um all right so um
you will catch up to her and do what you
want to do
so okay there are there is a loaded
third class car
that is just like watching with wide
eyes
okay and as soon as i catch up to him
into this woman i'm just like grab her
by the hair on the back on the back of
her head and haul her back against me
and just stab her through the heart from
the back
because i am done and it's i
i don't i'm not thinking about
consequences i'm not thinking about any
of the rest of this i am a predator and
i love it all right make me a sand
roll
okay
um
this is what you do all right um
so you jam your knife
into her heart and um
she just goes imueru
says hello and
a porter with a shotgun
a porter has a shotgun pointed at you uh
where where is he in relation to us he's
coming from the fourth class the
he's coming from the back of the from
the front of the train
from he heard all the screaming okay i
i'm gonna hang on to this woman and just
use her as
a shield oh we lost nick we lost
somebody
uh oh this'll be fun we get to now amy
gets to do more obs
fun
well we'll we'll get nick when he
gets in here we'll figure it out
um we might not be able to do a whole
lot because amy does
is doing this remotely not in the in the
studio thanks for
bearing with us as everything continues
to go to hell
um yep emma drinks champagne lucky her
uh so this porter who looks scared
um because there's a crazy woman who
just stabbed
somebody through the heart is
pointing a gun is pointing a shotgun and
lie down lay down so you
too donald and uh
uh the doctor you come through
and you see you see alexandra
with this indian woman just stabbed in
the
in the heart holding her and this porter
has a shotgun and is looking right at
her and is yelling lay down
i wanna keep the doctor back so he
doesn't run there and get
shot like he always does cover behind
the door
and at this point everyone in this uh
train
is just like diving down mm-hmm
ma'am you you've just killed someone
and apparently set a fire i need you to
lay down
one of them great deal of trouble one of
those two
[Laughter]
sorry that was so awesome good timing
lucy
not much so this this poor porter is
just are you going to start backing out
yeah i will back up a few paces keeping
the the
i mean the dead woman is still impaled
on my dagger
i'm strong enough now to hold on to her
and keep her
like against me as a shield as i back up
a couple paces toward donald trump
i'm glad i'm glad i'm glancing back at
him like it's me
you feel everyone in this train
memorizing every inch
of you yeah a them
i'm i stand out anyway i have a 90 size
and a 90 appearance i stand out whether
i like it or not
not in maasai country you don't
um so doctor you donald
like pushed you back so quote you didn't
get shot like you always do
uh end quote oh come on we were picking
on him while he wasn't here that was the
point
i don't think we can use that but i
don't either um
and the the porter
um they're running out of porters the
you know the porter is
just like he's like super freaked out
because
you know they tell him he he had like
one day of training on the shotgun
but he's just like just lay down please
just lay down can i like lock eyes with
him and be like this is above your pay
grade
i have i have nothing against you
this is above your pay grade walk away
this is exactly what i'm paid for you
committed a you
killed a woman you're not paid enough
for this
you're not paid enough to deal with i
want to give props to amy
who laid out the obs stuff and got
everything back where it should be uh
well done while like doing it not from
her normal computer
it's a nice job thank you so much amy
for that well done
thank you so much you're still muted so
i can't hear you i'll kill you last of
all
uh all right i can read her lips pretty
well um
so so you're but you're like you're
backing out
right donald has his gun oh my goodness
out but it's behind the wall
i'm sorry hidden behind the wall i think
i can't see what i'm doing i'm
not looking at anything but the woman
who stabbed another woman i'm well i'm
watching him to see what he does as soon
as his gun's out
mine's out i'm holding an action
i'm i'm actually pausing here and being
like just walk away
you you killed a woman and you you
set the dining car on fire i killed the
woman who set the dining car on fire
so one of those things is correct yes i
kicked you out
of this car for stabbing that woman
earlier
yep she was shipping she was working on
setting the the car on fire and then
dooming all of us
well done just back up it doesn't mean
we're sitting in a
chair ma'am do not leave this train
the police will be the police will meet
us in the station
sir you do not want to play this game
with me i am good at killing you are not
that's a terrifying thing
better write that down wow this guy this
guy is
he needs a heel steel nerves going on
you know a good therapist there are more
of us
and we have another gun just a few more
steps just
sir i'm gonna need you to be quiet this
woman is a dangerous person back away
from her
get off sir back off the train you're
not even supposed to be in third class
oh you should be focusing on her right
now
[Laughter]
you really should be this one knows how
to deal with my brand of dangerous
um so unless unless you try to leave the
train
he's just like holding you there okay um
he's like yeah he's just holding you
there
how far away is he from me at this point
uh you are almost back to where donald
is he is almost in the middle of the
train he's 50 feet from you
okay movement is tough
we're accomplices in any way um
i'll actually glance back over my
shoulder at donald and raise an eyebrow
i've got this
i got you and i'll shift forward a
couple a couple of steps still holding
the woman's body against mine it should
be noted
you're lucky he made it as soon as you
move forward you're lucky he made his
sand roll
like you see the finger like slide
towards the trigger
you wanted me to come i'm coming no lay
down
lay down i'll just look at him inside
and in one fluid motion pull the knife
out from behind
from from inside the woman and fling the
body at him
all right i mean
i'm going to say he's going to make a
sand roll to not just shoot the dead
body
this guy needs a promotion it's too bad
to die
because he has made four sand rolls in a
roll
i'm impressed annoying this is back up
character material and his sanity
i rolled randomly for it it's not good
he was already on edge
um so you throw the body and
um he will you it will have the you
know
uh he like lifts the gun up and he's
just like ah
he briefly he's definitely distracted
and and when when that happens i'm
moving
and and moving with i mean imagine
with the guys and out
all right so you are all leaving the
train all right emma
hold on she moves past me right yeah i
shoot the guy
[Music]
he's following us he's all right so
there are 40 people in this train just
like
oh the shotgun donald no
all right yeah you who you making take
um
i guess you pull out your pistol is that
oh
make a pistol roll it's just a regular
success all right that throw your damage
72 that's a 10 plus two right
yeah 10 plus two 12 damage uh
he goes down i was going to say that
that would have knocked me unconscious
i'll run up and get the shotgun in case
he's still
so you're going to move towards the guy
because at this point people in the
train are starting to stand up
and they're like you just killed him
i'm a doctor hollister come on
no they're leaving let's go we're going
one minute we're let's go if you're
gonna continue to move forward
yeah i'll i'll run up to him all the
people in third class are just like
murderers you're all murderers
so i'll neither chris and i will take
off
where are you running to back to where
joan is
all right back to the second class car
we we're we're passing the dining car
um i mean
it seems like the fire is being
addressed
so i would i be able to guess then that
the
fire spirit thing is gone you have no re
i mean you have no idea
well if the fire is being if the fire is
being addressed and actually being
fought
would i be able to assume that something
that is like keeping the fire going is
gone
or would that not be a fair assumption
who knows
you're dealing with like things that you
can't assume about you know that night
of chris
felt like she felt some sort of she had
some sort of celebration she felt good
about something
um when she was trying to banish it and
you know
you know that as you run by it seems
like
that poor guy with the with the fire
extinguisher might be making some
now he's got a like a bucket of sand
that he's throwing on and all this stuff
um did you start but the dining car is
slag
the dining like the middle of the dining
car is just like
bowing down and
uh you're not sure this train will be
able to continue on
did you start the fire no that woman
that that i stabbed was summoning
a spirit of some variety it was fire and
heat and horribleness and it settled
down in the middle of the dining car
and night of chris was trying to get rid
of it remind me to kick hollister in the
what do you what evening night of
christmas what happened
let's save that question until we can
sit down we can't sit down for quite a
while we've got to move
well then we don't talk about it for
quite a while fine
uh hollister so you're still alive
you are moving towards the guy people
won't let you near him
he shot him he did i'm a doctor
uh all right they'll that starts to get
through to them and they'll like
um they'll they'll let you buy um
and you see at least two weapons
coming out at least like two long knives
um from several people
are they but are they moving towards me
are they this is like
this is just like you know they're like
what the hell is going on
i'm gonna like all right yeah i can get
to the guy
all right make me this will be a
first aid roll yeah i'm not
fumble is 96 and higher right
oh god yes yeah okay i didn't fumble
all right you 95 it i-95 did
[Laughter]
all right he
seems dead as the day is long
so there's a big hole in his chest
that's what i do
yeah oh yeah that's that's uh
that's pretty bad i'm not that
good of a doctor
[Laughter]
you're not a necromancer man
necromancer is just a medic who's too
late
so you come running up saying i'm a
doctor and then you stand up and go
not that good a doctor and you just walk
away i
i mean i'll be more apologetic than that
it's like there's a hole in it
like that that was square in his chest i
so now you're trying i don't want to
uh so they will not that now they've
decided they're not going to let you
leave
they're like you're gonna stay here and
answer
like we're not letting another
accomplice get away
i i didn't do this no your friends did
what makes you think they're my friends
i saw people coming this way i i just
saw what happened i wasn't gonna
he had a gun you'll wait here until the
police come and you'll answer their
questions
if you saw what those people did you're
fair enough and you were like
well let's see here how smart are these
nope all right yeah yeah they don't they
don't they don't have a second backup
point but they're just like you're a
witness
you're all witnesses you're a white
witness
yep and unfortunately that's more
important
uh all right so emma
make me i'm waiting for another
opportunity though i'm going to act
compliant and safe
oh we might lose nick again i hear what
you're saying nick i get it
yeah you're looking for a place to run
um
emma no i didn't know if someone else
would say something yeah i'm gonna add
complaint and if it looks like they're
gonna be
11 yep that's a extreme success all
right
you see two you see a porter and the
conductor
like full-on running
uh from the front of first class which
has a small little lounge
where usually the conductor waits and
there's a bartender there and actually
the bartender as well
and the bartender with that roll
you'll see it the bartender has a pistol
okay and they're all running towards
uh towards the engine
okay which is towards the dining car
right yes towards the time
okay so i'm gonna discreetly put my
sword someplace that not everybody can
see it
and start moving forwards in the
classes so i'm gonna go to
the next car over which is third class
or second class second class
yeah so you will make it you'll open the
door to second class and you
joan joan as you the door comes
open
and you're sitting there and you're like
uh haranguing this poor guy
no okay and
um the guy who's talking with you
like suddenly turns his head towards
the lower classes and the door
to the second clap to the first class
cabin opens
and in run the conductor another
um the the last porter
uh and the bartender and the
conductor
will come in and say ladies and
gentlemen i'm gonna need everyone to
take their seats
we are having an emergency please
sit down and start crying but he's
saying this as he's not
like he doesn't stop moving i'm going to
start crying at the guy oh no don't
leave me
i'm just crying the conductor will come
up like as he passes you he just looks
at the port of the unit says
handle that and come on and the guy
who's in fro
the guy who's in front of you like
looks at you and you can clearly hear
him he's trying to say this quietly
but he says to the conductor i heard a
gunshot
and and the conductor looks at him
and says
damn it ma'am sit down now
and i sit down because all right what am
i going to do with all those guns out at
me
uh oh that nobody was pointing a gun at
you no i'm just saying with all the guns
out what am i going to do
uh there's only one gun out right now
only the only the the bartender
okay so so if there's only one gun out i
can say
you because i was thinking if they all
had guns i'd be like okay but i was like
what you're not gonna stand protect us
from what's coming you need to stay and
protect
us we're all just sitting here sitting
ducks
you handle this the rest of you come
with me so the the poor porter is going
to stay with you and the others
are are going and the porter is getting
more and more frustrated with you and is
getting more and more strident
um so alexandra and donald you
will make it up to the second class car
and you know the window where
where i believe we were sitting we're
going
to try and climb in the window well just
signal check it if i can see somebody
through the window outside
so you see the back of jones head as she
is like carping at some poor
uh oh
yeah i am definitely keeping low and
against the side of the train because i
do not want to be spotted this close to
first class
to second class in first class though
donald wants to be seen
i do not so there's a guy behind like
you see the porter like lock eyes with
you for a second
and he's like what the hell the the fire
in the dining car ma'am sit down
you get back in the train the train's on
fire you idiot
uh the train is not on fire this car is
not on fire please
everyone remain calm down train's on
fire he does that like
that we're all getting up we're all
getting
all right yeah everybody starts
jumping up and running uh
uh like both through both aisles they
are like clearing out of this place
um the people who go towards the dining
car are
not happy and they they try to turn
around when they see the actual fire
so then they're coming back this way so
emma you have just launched into this
whole mess
okay is it easy
it's not easy to get past this commotion
so my best place
got it so i'm basically fighting like an
entire train first so i'm
am i is there a way to get out between
first and second class okay there are
two steps down at the end okay
the porch of every train all right i'm
out all right i'm outside
so you both you both step down yep and i
go around to go look
i'm like heading back around to kind of
go back where i was initially following
the porter
and the bartender and the captain or
whatever
okay um
so they they seem you see them
have they have stopped at the fire um
and they have they have the door open
and they seem to be
having the they're yelling inside about
something
you can't hear what they're yelling
until you get closer um
so donald and nidacross people are
starting to stream out
of this of this second class car
first class remains blissfully unaware
lucky them just wait till they discover
i want i want to know that's awesome
yeah so a guy a guy like pokes his head
out and sees everyone going out and goes
everyone
seeing all the commotion and people
emptying out of the train i'm going to
look at donald and say
it's going to be better if i'm not near
here i
imagine your part of the train will
empty too in just a few moments just
think
just hide for a moment until it's we can
hide in the crowds or
better i'll get the i'll get the bag out
i'll get the baggage
everyone in third class knows my face
i need to i need to not be here
you can go just i don't know where do
you want to go
i'm gonna look i'm gonna look around and
see what the terrain looks like around
us and try to find somewhere to go and
just lay low
okay yeah it's it's pretty
it's it's hilly but you can you can
easily i mean you can easily find a spot
where you are still in sight of the
train
because it is all lit up in various ways
uh
and and easy to see you're about
um you're about 50 yards
off to the left of the train okay so so
i will look at donald and point
like a very slight hand gesture to
indicate which direction i'm going and
then
just take off and go hide
i want to talk to joe and get our
baggage off the train
uh so the baggage is all but down by the
engine
which is the front yes which is by
fourth class
um all right dr hollister so
you were looking for an excuse make
me a luck roll
actually can i can i tell can i ask
someone to
go up to the second class car um
i made the lock roll but my my met my
medicine bag
is in the second class car i keep that
with me
can i can i ask someone to go get that
to see if i can
yeah somebody will go do that did you
make the luck roll yeah
okay so one of the guys with an with a
with a knife will go and do it
okay there's one less weapon in the
cabin
um but yeah he'll you tell him where it
is um
he's going to have to somehow convince
them he's not stealing it yeah i was
going to say
i want to do with a guy with a knife all
right um
i have suggestions mike can i talk to
joan jonah
um no joe yeah joe as every now that
everyone's flipping out
the the the guy who is with you is
just like fine and he starts to head
towards where everybody else is going
okay so yeah donald what's going on
john i need i'm gonna need some water
some food some pliers or blankets or
something i need it right away
okay all right i'm not staying on the
train
all right so a good sign that he
doesn't know where
he's gonna be nairobi we're going to
nairobi
and i guess that's where we're going
we're go wherever we're going the end
we're going to the end
um wow all right so do i see anything
around here that i can like throw in
luck what um
sure make me a luck roll yeah i'm just
saying if everybody's running around
maybe they left some stuff
you also steal first class i got a
lounge or something back there
no no no no i i fumbled my luck like
some people have some jackets
and things like that but not like
there's not like days worth of food or
anything here
yeah i know i've totally fumbled the
luck sorry
you find like a flask of whiskey that's
a start
i know i know he'll like that i know
he'll like that so i'll give that to him
like all she throws out is a flask of
whiskey
it'll keep you for a couple days right
no
um i in the commotion i can run the
first class right so
the stairs of the first class yeah sure
you start so as you're running up that
way you see the
engineer and the other guy there are
two people who are up in the front with
the uh
piling train they're coming walking back
and one of them has a shotgun
okay and the guy sees you and
he says sir just get back on the
train but he motions towards the first
class cabin
fine i'll climb my climb upstairs climb
inside
um and they are like they are doing a
um they like they are doing like a
check the entire train
so they are like walking the they're
walking the length of the first class
of the the first they've gone all the
way to the back of the train and now
they're walking all the way up
i want to just find some some water some
food or something from the lounge in the
first class some snacks whatever they've
got here
you can yeah you can find i mean it's
not going to be like you know
a there's not a day's rations or
anything like that but you
you you get some stuff so you you're not
going to starve anyway
looking i'll jump the train again yeah
so you're you're looking for all that
um all right so emma
you ran into this flood and now you're
moving up following those guys
and you see that they are detaching the
um
uh the dining car from
okay how was that
so i suppose is there's nobody near
me
that i could ask them how how are we
getting back
um you can ask somebody sure
yeah so one of the guys who's outside
you know detaching because i'm sure he's
like
underneath uncoupling it you see the
first class the first class guy is
here and he recognizes you because
that's his job
and he says oh i'm terribly sorry madam
we're just um
we're just separating the train there
should be a
uh where there's a switchback
we're gonna take this ruined part uh
there's a switchback about five miles
back that way that they're gonna take
uh the the engine to and a new train
will come through in the morning
so we're expected to wait here until the
morning we're very sorry
we're so sorry if you return
we'll have we'll have champagne
and cheesecake in the lounge
i was like maybe donald is taking a
whole cheesecake out of the yeah
um so i'm going to just look around a
little bit
um you know i just say okay and then
just kind of turn like i'm gonna walk
away
um and then just what does what does the
car look like i mean is it so the dining
car
seems like it's it it seems like it's
not on fire anymore it seems like it is
or at least it is only smoldering now
but it is just a it is slag
it is okay although the it looks like
the undercarriage
it looks like the fire didn't get to the
undercarriage so it's still like movable
okay all right so i'm gonna head back
and see where
joan is all right you find uh
you find joan outside okay
um and outside of the second class
and you both see a an african man
okay so i'm gonna let's just watch him i
mean like okay
so he'll come out a a about a minute
later he'll come out
with what you clearly recognize as dr
hollister's bag and he starts to head
back down the end of the train okay so i
poked joan i'm like let's go let's
follow this
okay let's go you followed that
um you see him stop this guy
at the where the where the conductor
is
he's like talking to the conductor
and the conductor and the and the bar
and the bartender who you now see has a
pistol
they both like start and they like run
okay something's going on that he's got
holly's stuff we need to find out what's
going on with that
somebody's probably been injured so i'm
like let's walk casual
let's walk casual all right they are
running this
leaving this poor this poor guy who
clearly only sort of knows how to do
this to finish
like on on connecting the train
uh disconnecting the train i should say
so they they are running ahead you guys
are just walking casually
yeah as in like you know we're just sort
of outside wandering around kind of like
what's happening what's going on that
damage looks terrible
um the the door to the third class cabin
bursts open
and the conductor and a
a man in shirt sleeves with a pistol
both
come running in and uh
immediately as soon as it opens i start
shouting my medicine back give me my
medicine bag
right right here's the doctor get him
his bag get in his bag and the conductor
comes in and looks at the poor man on
the ground
um makes his sanity roll the bartender
whoo the bartender is gonna make a
con roll
the bartender runs to the edge runs
back out the train and starts throwing
throwing up over the side of the train
um so you guys will see that as you come
up to this one
the bartender is like leaning over the
train throwing up
um and the conductor is like um
uh the conductor is sort of just trying
to get everybody calm and in their seats
and he's like looking at you like
you're a doctor
and he's like what
who shot this man i i only saw him from
behind
uh and like there's a cacophony of
voices in the train
uh it was the african woman who killed a
uh
who all who killed a porter and started
the fire
she she killed that woman right there
she she stabbed her and then shot
and then like donald is kind of getting
left out of all this for the african
woman
say i did not i don't use guns
um i look forward to that being your
in my defense your honor i don't use
guns
like the the that you're going to parry
mason it isn't it true your honor that i
do not use
guns i mean to be fair i would not i
would
i would not i would not throw donald
under the train like that
uh ah so to speak so um
uh they're like describing uh
like nick they're describing knight
across fairly well
you know and the the conductor is
like writing things down our little book
and he's like all right
no one's leaving this car we're we're
gonna get
once we're detached we're gonna pull
forward
to to the switch out and then a new
train will come through in the morning
and that train
will have we'll send a a wire that
train will have
uh until then we're just all gonna stay
here
[Laughter]
well that's what i showed up
for for tonight yes i was literally
about to warn you and then things
started moving i was like
that was amazing and i was worried about
the kitten
wow there's a there's a little easter
egg clip that somebody
so so after after
uh they finished taking statements from
everyone else i'll i'll pick up my tools
and apologize and say
uh there's there's nothing i i could do
i i did
i did see the woman run by though can
we step outside
so the conductor oh yeah sure he'll say
yeah he'll
and and all try to give a slightly off
description i'll try and mess with it
like no i got a good look at her face as
she went by
yeah and joan and i are trying to like
you know slightly like baby step closer
like we're having a conversation
like this like yeah and then just baby
step closer
uh yeah it works you guys are right
there the bartender is like now
starting to like get himself back
together and um
he's like looking at the conductor and
the conductor says go in there and
um and yeah you've gotten all your
stuff
you've gotten stuff off the train uh
and that sort of thing
yeah wow so
alexandra basically yeah you you thought
that she's
she told you where she was gonna be so
that's no problem
um so they're gonna let
doctor they seem to this guy the
conductor seems fine with just letting
you
go he's like come on your help um
if you don't mind i'd like to ask you
to come with the train to the
switchback to speak to the detectives
can i can i get cleaned up there i hope
i
tried to obtain yeah of course of course
uh
you should you should go yeah
uh please were you were you in
second class doctor yes oh well
well we have we have an extra room in
first class a sleeper i'll i'll get you
set up there
thank you the train the backup
train will be through in the morning
um but you know you can at least clean
up and then when
when in about an hour we should be ready
to
take the third and fourth class back and
i'll just ask you to come with us then
okay of course
um and and he'll like he'll he'll he'll
uh
um the other or
yeah there's an order here i don't feel
like i i fudged the description enough
do i think that he
took me more seriously than everyone
else in the third class car
um yes okay you are i mean
you are significantly whiter than anyone
in the third class
car yeah i i mean
it's still you know tall black woman you
know that's kind of where
it ends you know that's okay um
so so they they an order
a um
uh he'll take you up to the to the first
class and they'll put you in a sleeper
um that hat you know and and show you
where the restroom is and get you
cleaned up
um and they're trying to get everybody
back on the second class train
now that they're separated um
and as as they undo it the
engine will pull forward it pulls
forward about 50 feet
to separate the smoldering car um
from the sec the second and first class
cabins
um the second and first class cabins are
now um
uh they're they're they're totally
uh isolated they they don't have any
means of motion
um they have been they've they've
locked the brakes
and they're just sitting there waiting
for the backup train um
if you guys don't do anything else in
about an hour the train's gonna take off
uh i will try and look get out and look
for people
all right you easily find um
uh you find joan and amy no problem
we're outside waiting for them yeah
they're they're right there yeah we're
eavesdropping so what are we
the earshot of people or no no no yeah
you guys are off by yourself
okay so what happened why is
everything on fire
where is everybody you're
you're not used to there being fire when
it was yeah
how did this happen without me um
so yeah donald and i slipped out the
back
uh and and when we
came because you slipped out the back
because everything was fine
oh no because because the dining car
was on fire
ah okay yeah and
nida chris had taken control when we
got there but alexandria seemed to
take back over did anybody see the big
ball if i mean did the the ball i saw
nobody saw it so did knight chris summon
the ball of fire
i don't think so she said that she was
trying to help
right before uh
she lost control and then
alexandria murdered a woman and then
donald murdered a man
okay great
i wish we could use that as a title
because it's a nice wrap
up nice wrap up holly so
and there we're in jail heading to jail
they're not around when i was trying
to keep all the porters and things in my
car
so should we look should we look for
them or do we assume that they just
follow the tracks to nairobi and so
there is nobody around here i can say
donald wanted me to get him some
supplies and they were going to be
out here somewhere and meet us in the
town
okay and how are they going to meet us
so
so we can we can kind of estimate how
long the trip
was going to take and how long we took
to figure out like just
roughly were we close were we halfway
there
you were about halfway so you were gonna
it's a you were gonna get in
um you were about three quarters of the
way let's say you were going to get in
in about three more hours
um by train so it would probably be
you know a 12 hour walk you know
depending on conditions i mean the
problem is also
um you know you know from the guidebook
that
there's also like you're going from sea
level to 6 000 feet
so the elevation you know that's gonna
make it take even long you know there's
a reason the train is the best way to go
there
i wish there was a way we could get them
back in and like you know maybe hide
them in the first class or something
well we have to find that i just got a
cabin in first
class do they check inside of those
often
no so there is turn down service
so they come in and they like set your
bed up and everything
but is there like a do not disturb or
something oh yeah you can easily do that
you know
um but now remember they they want you
to go back with the third and fourth
class
car with the engine oh you tell us that
too
huh
well but if no
so i guess well well you have you have a
room though if you could
alexandria you could potentially
uh getting her on and off is
yep ortega so maybe that would work but
not only that does anybody know where
they are and i'm like looking out
around obviously sure with it
within you know once you get within 20
feet from the train it's all darkness
yeah so i do something really dumb i'm
like cacao
so i i would be watching the train
and especially with all the fire going
on in the bright lights exactly
um so unfortunately you don't have
binoculars
and you know you're you know you're 50
yards away so that's a fair distance
and there are a lot of people milling
away from the fire you know you don't
know who is who
okay but you you hear emma's caca
the unmistakable majestic
um hearing that the original bird of
paradise
seriously i'll look back i look over at
donald and then call
back a similar cacao just to let them
know
we're over here i don't know i should
recognize your voice
[Laughter]
she won't recognize my voice but anyone
responding to her is good from this
distance is going to be me she's not
that stupid
[Laughter]
[Music]
emma you hear a you hear an unfamiliar
kaka
too feminine to be donald come on
it's like cacao all right
you you can go back and talk to them but
to keep to the shadows they did
recognize you from the shooting
i can do that it's not a problem you
stay right here i'll be back i'm not
going anywhere
i'll be back i'll i'll sneak back
through
sneak through wander around
they are starting to get every white
person back onto the train
all right i'll wander over to where and
then yeah and we've kind of wandered to
the outside to the dark
area so that we're not easily found
and in the direction of your the boring
cacao
you're standing away from the train like
out of your you're okay
yeah on the dark side so wherever the
cacao came from we're kind of out there
always on the dark side yeah so you
definitely see
at least at least the engineer has a
torch
and he is like walking up and down the
train he hasn't really
he's not really turning it out yet um
but
um and the conductor is doing a a
count we can't stay out too long they're
going to
know where they're going you're going to
want to try and get her back on the
train and you're going to want to get
back
there it's fine they're looking for her
there's no point getting back on the
train
but how do we how do you find us so i
don't know any hotels i don't know where
we're going to stay
how do we how where do we meet you and
when all right
tell me a place maybe a church location
um looming in the background yeah
go to go to the biggest church thomas
you missed one of the great moments in
quests in chaos history
can you guys probably not
no because i brought my headphones in
what do you consider one of the great
moments of quests and chaos
which one remember when i had a green
what green screen the cat took care of
that
good
we'll times you the largest church i'll
be there at noon on each end
for let's take you guys an hour and
we'll find you
by the way cameo
your dog you know as much as i don't
like dogs
they wouldn't have pulled the stupid
things no they wouldn't have they were
sleeping over there
okay so like what is it like so assuming
it's like two days from now at noon in
the biggest church or something
right so we'll be there every day at
noon the largest church in the city okay
all right all right so that would be the
19th
donald if you can if you can get back on
if you don't get back on they're going
to suspect you
it's fine it's just i can't have her by
herself i'll take care of this
but they they know your name if you can
smuggle her into one of the first class
cabins
and you get back on we're
we're together yeah it works out really
well
they the people don't even think that
you shot him
so you you you were the witness for
me then right you told them a good story
i'm covered i tried to i i fudged her
description
uh they said that she shot the man
um i didn't correct them and and
but i i they're still looking for a tall
black woman
how do we get her on the train and how
do we get her off the train
well that's that's her skills i have to
get
up to the the second and third class
with the engine they're gonna take me up
early
is there a window room can we go to your
room
sorry nick just to be clear the
switchback is back the way you came
oh no sorry no you're right actually
they're going to take you up early
you're right yeah sorry yeah
uh is there a way to get into the room
from a window can we open the window
my question is is there because like i
already have a first class cabin so i
could
i'm assessing yeah there is a window
um you know for obvious reasons they
don't make them
you know hey person why didn't you climb
in the train size
yeah so it would be a tight fit um
but possibly
okay so i explained what what
like room i i'm just like i'm kind of
right there so i will
like
a tall black woman climbs in hello
i mean and that's the point where
alexandria gets to act out all of her
rage against the english aristocracy
what if she's super friendly after the
chat i had with her she said
to more people be like duchess yeah
turn over a new leaf so so donald you're
saying you you'd go into the first class
and bring her in
or what no she'd climb in the window
yeah so if emma can open the window
we'll walk over
the window i'll just go back to my seat
in second class and it sounds like
i'm clean sounds good
we'll meet you there quickly as soon as
we can yep sounds like a plan i'm going
in
right all right back into the forest
so nick the they're they
they the
one of the the the first class guy and
the conductor
have now gotten most everybody back on
the train
and they're they're looking
for you know then now they're saying
hello uh
we're looking for and they say your fake
names
yeah oh i got my real name
unfortunately oh all right
i wasn't but i want to
i want to get their attention and
actually turn them away and talk to like
get them to
face me in the other direction so
they're not looking forward well doctor
we need you to get
on the train because we're going to be
leaving
oh excellent so they'll
one of the one of the um
porters will take you up to the third
class train
and um
when you get on the train there's just a
lot of stone-faced people who've seen
things they shouldn't have seen and are
just like
you know not not happy at all the
porter is like i'm gonna wait outside
uh the the bodies are just sitting on
the floor with
jackets over them or just laying on the
awful and like
yeah everyone is just like staring
straight ahead as like
you know trying to like ignore the
awfulness around them
and the train starts up so um
you're heading towards nairobi
uh now um
uh so they start look and they they
will call out
um amy you're you're in first class
so they call it your fake name first
yep that's annie not emma not
emma yeah exactly that's annie hathaway
by the way
and hathaway yeah so i opened my uh
door and just said you're on the train
oh wait sorry you're on the train
already
yeah as soon as donald said go open your
window i was like peace out i got
strawberries and champagne they're on
the train they're not calling out your
name
okay and they but they do a count like
they come by
and they like check okay here um
and so then joan joan and donald they
start to say your fake names
trying to get alexandria on the train so
i'm away
okay so i i i will be i'll i will come
up on the train
uh you're your seat mate uh
have you seen him um
well dr hollister he he's on the other
part of the train no no not dr
hollister
mr donald oh i have not seen him i
have not seen him recently
um he may he may just be he may be
outside he was kind of upset about this
whole thing
i see i see well yes
uh well we'll we'll take a look
for him thank you
um thank you let's see
here what sort of role is this gonna be
um so walk me through alexandra how you
are going to
get into emma's window
okay so first class is furthest away
from the engine
donna will at least get close enough i
think to let me know
hey this is what's going on get into the
window get in now
um i would what i'll help lift your up
lift you up
you don't i'm tall enough i can get
through the window on my own now
i'm not five foot nothing anymore man
you know he's gonna help anyway though
dude
hold habits die hard you know this is
this is what we do as they do
um but yeah i would get to that window
as quickly as
as i could in cover of of the darkness
to like circle around away from
um because the engine would have a bunch
of lights but first class might not so i
would circle around the back of the car
and look for the open window and then
climbing through the open window
hopefully
hoping there's only one uh
42 success all right yeah um
there's one so one brief moment as you
are donald has gone back into the train
you are alone
out in a cops a small cops
of scraggly trees
looking down at a train that
full of mayhem that you know you have
been part of um
and in your head nidacra says we
could leave
now
very well they'd be a little bit too
worried they'd spend all of their
attention and focus looking for
me you feel a weird little itch in
your head but then
nothing and she just says very well
um so yeah make me a size role
and this is an opposed role now you
because what's your size
90 yeah yeah i know
she got tall yeah real tall 55.
so here's some bad news
you she got tall
she also got back and
um you can make it to about your waist
through the window and then it gets hard
okay
yeah i'm gonna just like plant my hands
next to my hips and push as hard as i
can i've got reasonable strength
i'm willing to just to cut up clothing
if necessary
um so you can do this
fast okay
[Music]
eighteen birds of paris a
a right right on critical success you
just got birds of paradise
it's my turn to roll the ought one
andrea
uh so
um you are hanging your legs
are hanging out of this thing when um
you hear a voice say uh
ma'am
and you you like emma you see a
flashlight like go across your window
okay so i get down on the ground
and i basically like kind of reach up
and grab alexander and try and tug her
down
i'm helping with my hands like something
as hard as i can because i'm assuming
she's got
pants and you can't see what color her
legs are right
uh
make me a luck roll let's see what sort
of
i always wear pants i don't wear skirts
um
yeah wait i mean 10 6 is normal it would
be weird if it was 10.60
yes sure 10 6 is good
okay all right what is what's your luck
again 26.
so i either made it by 10 or it's 106. i
don't know
it's a normal success um
uh so so does she slide in
she does but and and she
and she is wearing pants but they have
been pretty well torn up
and there is like the window slams
shut and there's like a piece of fabric
and the guy grabs it and he says ma'am
you look you lost this
uh yeah he'll just hand it to you
okay a slice of fabric yes you do yep
have a good night and i like take it and
just do that and then slam the window
shut
all right we have we should have a
a replacement train by the morning
excellent thank you thank you for the
update i'm
gonna have a good night i'm just gonna
crawl under her bed and stay there
at first because alexandria is used to
being smaller than going
to none of them swearing under her
breath in italian
how can i hide alexandria like to me i'm
trying to make her a coat rack at this
point
that might be the only way is to just
feel like if
somebody shows up here's my coat here's
a
here's a thing just stand like this like
she barely fits
in the you have a you don't have a
bathroom you have a
um like a sink area yeah you
no you know what this is not the orient
express you don't even have that
there's like a there are two communal
bathrooms that are quite nice
but they're not but those are at the
edges so you literally have your one
one room with a little friend not french
door what are the doors that like
collapse open and closed i don't know
not pocket doors
or are you talking about the kind the
accordion type that yeah yeah
okay you have like a a tiny closet
that that has those kind of doors
does she fit in there it's it's not she
if she crouches
okay let's let's
let's agree to this if there's someone
comes knocking at your door
i'll go hide in there okay it's either
that or like i don't have enough clothes
with me do i to like
take everything out of my suitcase and
be like and then just hide under a bunch
you're just gonna have a pile of clothes
on the bed and hope she's
and i don't know i was looking at emma
with like this huge
look of exasperation just like i want my
old body back
i don't like being this tall emma
yeah emma like looks at you and like
gets a fire of inspiration and just
starts throwing clothes on the bed and
it's like
in there and you know you're just like
you get in and it like covers your
midriff basically you know
that that would have worked when i was
five foot nothing okay
and now six foot tall all right
i'm sorry maybe we should
cut your hair and put a hat on you i'm
don't touch my hair you
uh make me a power roll
[Music]
uh 25 hard success all right
you feel a weird little tingle when you
said you shut up
he's like
hollister's going to give me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] later
for letting her take control
we're going to talk about that later
okay but currently it's me in control
so how did that go were you able to just
come come straight back
or he talked me forward
i think is the best way to describe it
he knows me
well enough after all of the therapy
sessions to pull me forward
but i ha that's no good i mean
if it takes someone to pull you forward
i i know
i gave her control because she was the
only one who could possibly
banish this fire spirit thing the damn
woman
summoned that's at the fire in the in
i mean i kind of understand that
sometimes you do
dumb things because you think it's the
only way to solve the problem
not saying bicycles and grenades were
the best idea
just saying it was the way that i you
know that i thought you solved the
problem but like
i think we've got a bigger problem if
you do that again
and what happens if hollister doesn't
talk you forward
what happens if halliburster doesn't
of you know fakes fakes her for you
you know what i mean well donald and i
have a code word
to tell him that it's me
or at least that i'm in control
otherwise
i don't know i imagine if you see me
start doing blood magic
question especially if it's before
breakfast
well yeah that is that's always the
worst time you gotta have breakfast
first
okay i'm so tucked over here okay
so then i like after we settle in a
little bit i just kind of want to sneak
my sword out and see if it's
if anything is weird about it it's like
on fire yeah it is definitely like
um it seems a little more
corporeal than it was before
i'm like eyeing it out of the corner of
my eye
i mean i mean as someone who sleeps with
a dagger under her pillow i understand
however you don't just check in to make
sleeping with my weaponry is the like
death metal album i never knew i wanted
to buy
that was i mean i slept with my bag of
grenades what makes you think i'm not
sleeping with my sword
so there's a uh
there's gonna be a very un well for
second class a somewhat uncomfortable
night
as you're sitting
you know in your chairs basically all
night yeah
um there is now the porters uh
in in second class there are two porters
um
one of which has a has a a a not so
subtly concealed shotgun and
they are they are watching they're
just making sure everybody stays in the
train
uh in first class it's a much more
comfortable night
uh you know they they bring by
you know they bring by tea and and
then
and then in the morning they'll bring uh
uh they have pastries
uh but it's gonna you know it will be
until the morning before the backup
train comes
uh professor hollister you dr hollister
you
um have a similarly uncomfortable trip
riding in a car full of uh
very angry people with two dead bodies
and one
freaked out porter and
the engineer oh they do
you know it's not all good times in
first class they announce the bar is
closed
ah poor emma
uh so and
and you will
when you you pull into nairobi
uh there's a switchback and um
you're about you're about a half mile
from the station
and about five in the morning the backup
train
pulls up next to the switchback
and you see several uh
gentlemen get off and come towards your
train
and clearly some police detective
types
uh they get on and one of them
immediately sees you and says sir can
i can i speak with you please outside
of course i'll pick up my
bags and take them with me and
uh the other detectives are talking to
people in the train
uh and to the to the porter and that
sort of thing and
um and he will basically you know you'll
you'll give him your fakes
your sorry your your your bad
description again
um and you'll you'll sort of um
what is the story that this evil woman
did all of this
uh yeah i didn't that i didn't see her i
came in
um after she had killed the woman and
was using her as a body to move forward
to
shh do i to shoot the uh
the porter okay
uh and um
and they'll they'll ask you like
um
you know they ask you the cause of death
they ask you know about the two people
one was shot one was stabbed
i don't know i wasn't expecting it
for sure as she was moving forward
uh i assumed that she had another knife
and and once i heard the gunshot i just
moved back out of the way
it was quite shocking so you didn't see
her have a gun
no no i heard i heard other people
say that yeah i heard other people
say that uh
she had shot him i see okay
um well thank you very much sir um
i we can if you if you wish to wait
here
uh we'll have once the
once this train links up with the other
two cars we can return you to
nairobi
