last time
nick noticed that
and emma's spot on the overlay is just
an empty box that shows the background
and we really really wanted
to have a burning hotel room
in that space or something but it's
surprisingly hard to find
a non it's probably hard to find
creative commons pictures of burning
hotel rooms
that aren't attached to awful stories
so you know we'll just you know if
you look like you can barely see
nailathotep behind amy which
seems appropriate the the power behind
the throne
so yeah last time you guys
uh got a you got a a
a ticket to an exclusive art auction
uh and then the person that gave you the
ticket was mystery
well not so mysteriously died you met
a an italian crime boss
who seemed to have an insect problem the
problem being he was an insect
uh oh god oh scar of eddie there we go
i was like did i oh we have a picture up
for emma now
that's awesome what's burning it is the
kyle hotel
it is a burning hotel for emma that's
absolutely incredible that's
you know in the true lawful neutral
sense
elder brat has given me 500 bits to kill
someone comma anyone
does that count tom already wants to
just
get get this game over with and move on
to uh
other ideas so you know i can i can
sir no
i'm just excited for the next idea but i
just want to give them
you know no rush we happen to spend a
nice long time with this group
i i i want to see them succeed or fail
come december
uh so yeah you you got the invitation to
the
uh lovely the lovely auction
man tamagotoro slides me
500 bits come on guys he doesn't need
the help
also to bring in some more backup
characters
i like it no more backup characters i i
don't have any ideas
and i like wilson but i want to stay
with alexandria for a while
so and lonely yeti
thank you so much lonely yeti a thousand
bits to the players
i mean being being entertained by our
downfall counts is liking us
right that's i guess yes i will be very
entertained by your death
uh we have squirrel that's all we need
as long as we have squirrel
we'll make it thank you so much for all
the bits we really appreciate it
uh that is what keeps the lights that
our
thomas is enjoying in the studio on
right now and someday we will all be
enjoying
uh i'm just jealous because the studio
is air conditioned
and my home is decidedly not
you're making it worse man
wow all right elder brat is no longer
lawful neutral
uh now it's a thousand bits to the
players to keep me from killing you
thank you i i
you know lawful neutral is everything's
even there keeping it all
so this is this is this is chaotic
neutral
uh i think it's chaotic good really
i mean only if you cast yourself as evil
deer
have you met me yes which is why i don't
believe that for a second
um so yeah you got this uh
that picture of the hotel is very
distracting
this is why i have this dream up man out
of the corner of my eye on my other
monitor i keep like seeing fire
uh you you got the um
emma is in the vatican getting
uprated for
probably just for being emma really uh
and you had
a little bit of time to spend
in in italy you you met one of ali
you met one of dr
uh lamb's
uh old compatriots marco brunetti who
uh hired you to go to this auction for
him
uh and then it turned out that he um
yeah i think stole is the word he stole
the capstone
when you when he felt like it had been
uh when he felt like it you'd been
holding out on him
and then he tried to sell it back to you
because it turns out
he owed scaravetti a great deal of money
uh the good news is he no longer owes
scaravetti a great deal of money
the bad news is scaravetti has the cap
stuff
and scarvetti apparently doesn't want
money he wants souls
yeah scar betty is is mainly interested
in souls uh
so we're buying a bunch of shoes there
it is
um well you know italy is the place to
roam more like milan really milan is
your
your clothes place but italian shoes man
shoes
true that's true so you went to this
auction
and immediately started to notice
weird things happening and you
placed yourselves around the room before
the bidding really got started and
um the auctioneer
started to auction off a bejeweled
dagger and
something horrible took him over and
he then took over most of the audience
who started
to blindly walk forward
and be sliced open by his knife
uh and you know there have been
i want to say like three or four people
have been killed
uh and you uh
at the same time dr lam professor lam
had gone to the back
of the place when things started getting
crazy uh
to look at the items that were there in
particular a couple staves she saw that
looked somewhat familiar
and she was stalked by
a man in a golden mask with
the staves and we
are going to go into initiative
so let's see emma's not here so the
lowest initiative is gone
so i believe that's me still right
all right new character throws
everything off
uh so donald you have an 80
it is right yeah okay so
looking at pretending like i'm looking
at numbers 80 goes first
uh and what are so you are in this room
uh there are very few wet there's
no weapons you're you were in the back
of the room uh
close to the curtain because you heard
noises behind the curtain
uh and so you've now seen up at the
front of the room
uh the ritual sacrifice start to begin
all right donald remembers alexandria
rushing um
forward before him yep she had the first
one to go out there so his action will
be to follow her he's also pulling his
pistol out
did he tucked away behind him sure pull
that out and ready that as he runs
behind alexandria um
towards the auctioneer the guy with with
the the dagger all right
uh and alexander you have a 76
i do 75. 75.
all right players go first so go ahead
okay um
i i did manage to get one dagger through
the the security check so i'm drawing
that as
as i go okay and i'm getting this
auctioneer as fast as i can it may take
my entire turn this turn to get there
but i'm getting there
like on the double all right so as you
approach
the the deus
uh there is the floor is now slick with
blood
uh there are four
not lifeless corpses lying there
lifelessly just bleeding
out as they just stare up not reacting
at all
uh and as everywhere the floor is
covered in blood on this deus it's
starting to drip
towards the stairs the deus
is you you is marble and
as you as you sort of look up as you
head towards the dais
the air is kind of shimmery and you see
like
you're outdoors and there are marble
buildings that look
you can make a history role do i have
history
i have the base oh you know thank you uh
one of our
chat ninja people i should mention once
again
uh amy has real life she is working
crazy 10 hour a day longer than 10 hour
days
uh and is she would
much rather be here i promise you than
the crazy work that she is doing but
uh as always amy
we miss you and i hope the surgery is is
a success
no there's no there's no surgery amy's
fine she's working
i'm i'm sure she would prefer 10 hour
days at this point yeah she might prefer
surgery
so so yeah as you you you will get up
to the podium this turn
uh or sorry to the steps to the dais uh
you you know you can decide next turn if
you want to step
you know into the blood step into the
blood
well it's not like it's the first floor
that i've crossed it's been covered in
blood
true on a set and so also as you were
coming there
there is a line of these
of the the of the people in the auction
and the other thing you notice is that
as they come up the steps and as they
are in the blood
the audience are changing they are no
longer wearing their clothes they're
wearing like togas
did you make that history roll do you
even have it i didn't even i didn't even
try
i have the base in history it's a five
percent i'll give it a shot
why not well on your so you haven't
actually seen this happening yet don't
you'll see
okay i'll i'll i'll give it i'll give it
a try this is what inspiration
yeah no that's a of 68. do you like to
push that role
no i really would not i have i have five
in this
often think back to history class you're
assuming alexandria ever got history
classes
uh in my home game rachel pushed a role
in the last
in the le in our last session while she
was in an airplane
and she snapped she snapped off the one
of the struts of the wing
and so this biplane the white wings
started oscillating oh it was awesome
look i have after falling into a into a
pool
of goo the the one time that i pushed my
roll i don't
i don't do that it's too dangerous it's
so yeah on a 75 um
the the auctioneer will
now that you're close enough you hear in
a not
loud voice at all he says some do you
speak latin alexander
uh i speak so so so i speak italian and
the last time that we dealt with
sure i'll throw all through my birds of
paradise dice across the room why not
oh yes ought seven
that is the oh not almost a critical
success right
so he says uh
he says in in latin the closest that you
can kind of get to it
is let history live once more
uh and more more blood and the person
like it's it's almost this robotic like
uh the person whose throat gets slit
they just sort of sit down on their
knees and then fall off to the side and
the deus now has
five bodies on it and
and blood once again is just kicking
this thing um
and all right that was 75
uh 60s professor lam i believe
yes so oh right well i guess he's slow
so what i'm gonna do i see this guy
and i'm gonna say who are you
what are you doing with those items
while i'm rummaging in my bag
because i brought my my backpack right
looking for your crowbar
um he will he will simply say
uh
okay and i'm i'm getting out i'm going
to get out to my crowbar and i'll say
we'll see about that
all right we were just raided by
bird screams welcome welcome
bird we are playing call of cthulhu
and birds are near and dear to our
heart
whether you know i mean parrot sharks
are pretty mad birds
uh but we are playing
cthulhu right now the party is at an
auction where people are being ritually
sacrificed to apparently bring ancient
rome
back to the modern day and that was
uh 60s also on a 60.
um you reach out for your crowbar you
grab your crowbar
and this guy with the
with the guy in the golden mask who is
facing you will
just take one of the staves and he'll
just touch you
and he'll say he says
you speak do you speak latin yes you can
make latin role
no all right he says something in latin
that seems to have the word for history
in it
and he touches you with the stain and
you should make a pow
roll okay i should make this power roll
the the folks who rated us the mad
birds
they say caw in the chat which is
awesome
yes right back at you folks
um i got just made at 55 okay
uh you feel
something you feel a weird kind of
static electricity passes through you
and for a for a brief moment
uh the clothes that you were wearing the
the the sort of nice clothes you're
wearing became a toga for a brief moment
does it feel like the the stay of action
that i'm used to
or this feels very different
uh 60s 50s
hollister not nowhere near 50 but thank
you
thank you no there's no one in between
man is there is there anything along the
way
uh any like do i think i could easily
rip down a curtain just anything i can
get in my hands before i
charge towards the the stage so i'm
not like
if there's like a fold up chair that i
could grab i'll grab one of those
but the baroness is correcting my
history
uh apparently women didn't wear togas
you know what else didn't exist parrot
sharks or
knives that caused ancient rome to come
back
don't beat that person don't be that
person
i love the baroness too much to ever say
i won't have a word set against
her don't be that person this is all
fantasy
none of this has any bearing on any real
world
except for the fire extinguisher filled
with poison right that actually happened
i would bet all right but yeah
i'll grab a chair and i will make my
way towards
the guy that is slicing people's
throats open
all right extra careful if i get to the
slick blood on the uh
on the marble oh but i will get on it
yee huh all right so
you yeah you are joined donald
charging forward next round you'll see
the whole
shimmering blood history coming alive
thing
all right and that is the end of our
first turn
okay back to donald so donald you
make it up
next to alexandra and you see
um you see uh
looking out you're looking up and you
see like
one of the things on the stage was
actually a marble statue and as you look
at it through the shimmer of blood
the statue is actually vibrantly painted
it's like
painted with all the clothes on it and
and it looks beautiful
uh and through there you're outside
you're looking outside and you see
marble buildings there are um
incredible uh
why am i blinking on the word art
made with pieces of stone
mosaics that's the word that's right
and it but it is not
at all where you are this is you know uh
uh
somehow you are glimpsing into the past
you if you have history you can make a
history role
i'll take a stab at it why not why not
that's the first thing it happens
dan's pretty good since close yeah
fantastic close so you're looking and
you're like
is that ancient rome yeah
romer greece one of the other he thinks
all right so uh
are you i mean
[Music]
okay so stay stay back alex don't go on
that stage
so as you sort of come to the
realization
that whatever this guy's doing is
causing ancient rome
to come about to reoccur
uh you should make a sanity roll hey
fun times
as the fabric of reality is being yeah i
failed that
we can we can inspire that we can
inspire that
i'll take the inspiration if we got it
i'll do it we got it i'll try again
please
yeah 56 please i succeeded on my sl
no i'm at 54. i failed the second one
too
you lose to sanity from
the from realizing that time is being
frayed
in yet another way that you were not
um and all right that was 80s
70s alexandra so i hear what donald says
at my shoulder and i'm just like tensed
ready to jump up on this thing
um stay back recognizing that it will
probably send me back in time or
something weird because
temporal distortions are something i've
at least been passingly familiar with
if i could turn back time
well there was that temporal distortion
and then there was also you know
watching a world die under us i was
re-watching that episode today
um i'm gonna look around for anything
that i think i can
huck at him and and if i can't find
anything i'm going to throw my dagger
and just try to like peg it at him all
right
make me a make me a luck roll okay
uh that's a fail all right then you
there's nothing to hand
so you're throwing your dagger at the
auctioneer yeah
all right you're gonna get a uh
a difficulty die here because to not
well actually i'm gonna make you an
offer you can throw that thing
and the and not try and avoid the crowd
or you can try and avoid the crowd and
you know take a penalty die on the throw
so my question then is which stat am i
using
am i using my knife stat or am i using a
throw stat because that will affect my
answer
all i use knife sure okay then i'll then
i'll take the penalty die to try to not
hit people
okay
i rolled exactly the same on both dice
which is a success that hits roll your
damage
excellent that is a
he's gonna have to make a roll now uh
six max damage
nice so he does not dodge this at all
there's no like movement on his part
uh the dagger hits him and he doesn't
react
it it slides in and it definitely cuts
him
but whatever has taken him over
is you know um
yeah is not it he is not reacting to
any sort of stimuli okay um
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seeing
that i'm i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna go and
try and try to grab one of the nearby
chairs to try and just like
huck that at him next turn
up megan i've got this if you can hit
him with a dagger i can definitely hit
this fella
get him all right you know hopefully
he's
an evil high priest and not an innocent
person taken over by a knife he picked
up
look
uh speaking of which uh
he will say something else on in
latin
um then well he says the same thing in
latin and he slices another person
and another another person
drops and more blood and
every time one of these people falls
that's now six that have been killed uh
every time one of these people falls the
shimmer becomes a little less
vague and rome ancient rome becomes a
little more alive
oh and and i'll and i'll translate what
what he said for donald because since
he's standing right next to me
so he knows what we're dealing with
right
okay that was 70s
uh professor lamb so what i'm going to
try to do
is grab one of the staves with
my crowbar i'm going to try to drink it
out of his hand like try to get
i'm gonna call this an opposed
strength roll so i roll straight for
this yeah you're gonna roll your finger
now i would love a re-roll guys yep
oh that's better zero seven holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
that's better
yeah zero seven so yeah you will yank
that stave
out of his hands it's a stave so i gotta
have it
oh 98 all right you yank that stave
out
it hits the ground it shatters
and as it shatters this weird
purple mist starts to come out of it
and the guy in the mask looks at you and
goes
you fool what have you done you you've
released them you fall
he like as soon that hits the ground
he just goes you fall and he just turns
around and he's running back
into the back of the exhibit hall
away from ancient away from all this the
stuff there he's running into like the
staff
area but he is just taking off can i get
can i run after him without going
through the purple or
uh we'll find out next round okay uh
dr hollister i was just hit with
what might be an intelligent idea um
throw it away yeah part of me just wants
to charge onto this stage
but during this time did they have
the did they have the fire extinguishers
that you could
break the glass pull out and like not
the fire extinguishers but the fire
hoses
right it may shock you to learn that
italy in the 1920s
did not really have a fire code okay
then i'm going to stick with a bad idea
i'm going to get on the stage and i'm
going to walk over
because you know it's slick with blood
and i'm just going to slam his
uh dagger arm with a fold up chair
all right as soon as you step on
stage
yeah hard success nice all right so
you you step up there and there is a
shimmer again
uh and you feel briefly like your
raymond is going into some
unnamed ancient roman uh
uh garment period appropriate uh
and but it it's gone and you are back on
that stage
and yeah i'll let you make a brawl
roll on this guy
yeah did anyone else feel a breeze
god i wish i have a fan running just off
off camera i don't know if anyone can
hear it but
screw it my chances of landing with this
fold up chair
are not stellar but do we want to
inspire just for kicks
yes
you know what i'll actually not roll
with the dice that fumble
all the time yes please thank you
did you fumble i fumbled i hate you yes
that's a 98. that is an evidence you put
him on the emma board ezra
oh god you said this is slick with blood
wham oh yeah oh trust me we're getting
there
so yeah you come running up trying to
hit
i don't run up i'm not crazy you come
walking up and you step into a
swing and as you step into the swing
with a chair like your foot comes out
from under you
and you flip over and you are like
almost like
carry covered in blood as you are
rolling around and
make me a power roll with a penalty die
am i like flopping around like a fish um
i yeah i make it
all right regular success okay so um
i'm gonna regret asking this question
but
have you ever been covered in warm human
blood
i mean defined covered i i have
performed surgeries every so often stuff
squirts out
like not covered like this if that's
okay this is like yeah you are rolling
around in it and you are acutely aware
of blood-borne pathogens and things like
that
oh which said it you know what these are
gonna pay off now
gambler's fallacy well done mate
all right you lose one only one sanity
from this you're surprisingly okay
with it
uh and you feel that same weird like
static tingle
uh briefly and but it but it passes
uh we have now that it's the end
of a round we have 500 bits from the
muffin mage
i'm just gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm
gonna go before ezra kills us
for that us there's only one person here
that's going to die
you also have infectious 37
who has subscribed for two years to
question chaos
here's to that he subscribed before we
were actually doing things
he might catch the end of our barney
solari was running at
at about this time two years ago it was
it was before
chaos agents started but solari was
around now well two years
that is outstanding thank you infectious
uh really my favorite of the infectious
foods
you know some people say infectious 69
but that's trite no
infectious 37 is my favorite of the
infectious
is so are we committed to two more years
now is that what i'm taking away
for two more years and now we go to
the top of the initiative
and the muffin mage's favorite call of
cthulhu gm
tom what would you like to do this round
well clearly it it we it can be hit so
donald's going to put a bullet right in
the face of this uh
possessed auctioneer all right some sort
of field around him which makes you slip
so firearms 24 and that would be a hard
success
wow lamb all right roll your damage
so that would just be
the 10 d10 plus two so it'll be 12
damage yeah so you do 12 points of
damage
to this poor man
uh there's an awful moment
where uh
there's an awful moment where this man
you break whatever spell he's under for
a minute
for for a second as you shoot him in
the gut
and all of a sudden this man goes ah
and then he's gone and back is the like
red eyes and the knife is taken over and
like he went from being doubled over to
just continuing without what it is he's
doing
go down he does not go down but that
you know that was a that was a that
was a significant wound
uh all right alexandria
okay i saw hollister go up go up on the
deus
seeing that i'm i'm going to abandon the
the chair idea and just like back up a
few steps and
run and i'm and i'm going to stay low
and
like plant my feet and slide across them
across the die
it's just another kind of liquid on
marble it'll be slick but if i stay low
and
and keep my balance i should be able
to make it over all right make me a
power roll as soon as you hit the ground
made it okay there is again
that brief second where you
uh you feel like that static electricity
go through you
um and then you are sliding and you
are
once again it's it's kind of like you're
sliding through
warm chocolate sauce that's the
consistency it's thick
it's gooey for lack of a better term
it's cloying
yeah and it's awful so make me a
sanity rule
i will argue that i've been covered in
blood before
completely covered in blood more than
once
have you no that's if you have sure oh
absolutely
either there there there's been a couple
of times where it's been
leave no person alive and there's a lot
of people involved
okay i mean so again this is innocent
blood but you know
sure yeah you are a cold and heartless
killer i i have i have i have the
innocent part walled very firmly away
from the rest of my brain right now
you gotta collect that with some blood
that's useful so
i'm sorry make you a wet roll ezra uh
maybe a dex roll for the slide across
the stage
oh yeah 14 critical success so you
slide up and you notice that um
among the blood on this stage is blood
just pumping out of the stomach of the
auctioneer
you have now reached the auctioneer you
see your knife
in his shoulder you see a massive
almost assuredly fatal gun wound
if not fatal now soon in this guy's gut
um and as you get there you see you're
sliding up
another person just slice falls right by
you
and there's another just wash of
blood and that is
seven so now with seven dead people
every time everybody on the stage
there's a as soon as this person hits
the floor there's another pulse of that
same energy
that happened before and everybody in
the auction
all of you and a couple of other people
that
i won't go into need to make pow rolls
everybody does yep
[Music]
even backstage even backstage okay
nice
we can do that oh how much inverse
inspiration do we have
not much mine we have nine you just wait
no we've you we've gone through i have
been keeping very
careful track you should have seven
according to me because you got nine
and you had we've been going through it
you got
six and you had three i thought we
started with with four
we start with four though
so you should have then you should have
uh
so then that would put you a ten so you
should have eight
okay you see the cheating i have to put
up with i have been keeping very careful
track on here i
i don't know what numbers are you were
keeping very careful tracking yet you
were wrong
either way 500 from squirrel 500 from de
bruyne
oh wait a minute no you are right
because of the muffin mage i don't
acknowledge that
um i'll i i won't hold my breath waiting
for an apology but
ask the ask your favorite call of
cthulhu gm all right
good man good job oh i do have
so now we're at eight oh yeah now that
was a hard so
all right so everything's fine uh
and that and that okay uh
so yeah another person hits the deck
there are seven
dead people i was not aware that tiana
is always right with a hashtag
you didn't no oh yeah no there there's
been some amusing mistakes
uh when when thomas reads that because
the the capital i
team yep
wow thomas apparently did a double take
the first time that he saw that
to figure out what they were trying to
uh well there you go if i watch i'm not
i'm not always right i just try not to
be assertive on something when i when
i'm when i'm not
sure you know thank you
my high school choir teacher best advice
i ever got
loud and strong is better than we can
write
of course that really only pertains to
choir but
um so uh
all right that was 70s professor lamb
yeah no i'm gonna i'm gonna take off
after this guy ev
he is a bad guy i'm gonna scream for our
you know my friends it's like you know
they they're very busy i know i know but
i can't i don't know that do i
probably not no no so i'm gonna scream
for my friends and i'm gonna take off
after this guy
yes all right so
you managed to avoid this purple mist
that is starting to coalesce
okay cool i that's and you are taking
kicking off after this guy
no problem he has uh
now he has two rounds of running on you
so we'll
we'll deal with that in the chase
uh 60s dr hollister
yeah i will stand up recompose myself
pick up that chair
and take a swing all right roll a fight
brawl
part of me wants to critical fumble
again just because
if you if you hit me with that chair i'm
going to have words for you
just a regular mist do we want to leave
it at that this time
what what is your fight brawl do you
have anything above the base
it is bass yeah it's fine all right
so
yeah what if i push it it's all about
bass dude it's all about the bill
i mean it's all about lining it up if
anyone gets in the way i apologize
i i am i am low and on the other side so
i
shouldn't be on the other in the way but
is that acceptable
uh i don't see you on the other side
but i i i've i wasn't i wasn't sure
which which side of the desk we came up
on because i know donald trump
you ran up next to all the crowd there's
only one way up
okay so mike
would you like to push that dr
hollister
i hollister
strongly feels that he just needs to hit
this guy
it's like it this is this is this is
escalating
yeah just bear down people are dying
yeah
first do some harm that's a hard success
yeah hey holly
yay holly well done what do you roll for
uh a chair a chair would be a d4
plus your damage bonus which would be
nothing
but i'm hitting him with a fold-up chair
all right for
two damage all right so you crack him
like you'll haul back and you just crack
him in the jaw
and he his arms fly back
the knife just drops out of his hand
and he falls backwards seemingly
i wouldn't touch that with your skin man
well i don't know if anyone else is
gonna go for it though can i put a foot
on it right there
i'm not sure if i like the idea of you
tell me when i can go to put a foot on
it because that's what i'm going to do
with the first possible opportunity
oh my god i do not make it but i don't
fumble
all right you're you lose the knife
and the
you know in the celebration over
cracking him with the chair uh
the knife slides so it slides away uh
all right
back to the top of the lineup donal is
this guy's still standing or is he
collapsing
he got knocked down by a chair he
literally like
his chair hits him in the jaw and he
just like flies backwards
all right is is he getting up is he
moving is he
indicating yes he seems either
unconscious or dead
all right and there's nothing no one
else up here are the victims still
walking up to the is they still walking
up to the stage
they are standing but the same blank
eye
all right where where's the knife
where's the knife
alexander do you see it i mean do i
see it
i i was i was close enough and i would
have had eyes on it did i see where it
landed
okay i think donna wants to go up to one
of the people who's just standing there
and grab their jacket um
just pull their jacket right off of them
okay
i imagine they're wearing a suit jacket
so just yeah off of them and throw it up
on the stage towards alexandria
so she can use that to just grab this
knife and wrap it up
and you yes she knows where the knife is
uh
so at the start of the round i should
have had
everybody may everyone who's on the dais
so alexandra and dr hollister need to
40. made it okay all right you have that
same feeling but then uh
it passes okay all right
so yeah donald tosses you that alexandra
your name
yeah i'll turn and catch the jacket and
like go for it for the dagger and
wrap it up in the in the suit jacket so
i don't physically
so that my skin does not touch it okay
and let me know what kind of success you
get since you guys are making every roll
tonight
hard 24. all right you needed a critical
you
um so alexandra touches the knife and
all of the sudden
she is wearing a a gown from ancient
rome her hair is
her hair changes to this plated braid uh
she has the knife in her hand around it
is some sort of cloak
alex are you there are you are you there
uh
on a also on a 75 the poor auctioneer
dies
he he like has one moment where he
just goes
but he died himself he gave him that
oh god well i didn't i did not make it
well you didn't fumble so nope you get
you
game you are now one you see this guy he
like tries to like throw
a cart in your way as he's you're now in
like back hall of this thing
um he tries to throw a cart in your way
and it actually gets in his way and he
like stumbles over it and it's really
kind of sad cool i can launch myself off
damn it okay i'm gonna move in between
alexandria and anyone else who might be
stepping up for i'm going to try and
make it hard for anyone to step up to
get their throats
so there is a line of
um people without you know who seem to
be
i'm at the head of the line all right no
cut no
cutting no oh there's going to be
cutting
it's more slicing really i mean i'm not
really trying to
like how do you i'm too afraid of what
she can do with the
knife to do like a full swing against
her i'm more like
using it to like okay can i get an
opening and then take a swing
oh like right now it's just i will allow
you can so i will allow you to
essentially
use the chair as armor and that will
give her a penalty die on her roll
as you're kind of like holding the chair
and that's not gonna do anything
i was like on my knife rolls okay
um oh god everybody that's not
alexandria well actually
donald and dr hollister make me make me
spot hidden roles
all right success
oh all right so donald you are aware
that this auctioneer when the auctioneer
was taken over
like he wasn't um
almost almost sort of ritualistic
[Music]
oh it won't be my knife skill i hope not
anyway
well i didn't i didn't make that i'm
doing what i said i was doing i didn't
make the check
so i'm i'm terrified that she's gonna
come at me with her skills
and slice me to pieces all right uh
lay me if you will uh
all right this is now our eighth round
or no nobody died this round so we're
still at seven
um okay
all right so now everybody that's on the
stage so that's out
that's actually just dr hollister now dr
hollister
you need to make a power role
uh and that's a critical man you guys
all right yeah everything's fine you
guys no problem
uh donal what is alexandria doing right
now
uh she is standing there wearing
different clothes
holding that knife that same knife that
the auctioneer had
all right and she she's acting
robotic acting funny acting possessed my
eyes are blood red
so there's that that's bad okay got it
yeah all right
is she moving towards anybody or the
victim's moving towards her or moving
towards her
but she's staying still yes and that was
also consistent with the auctioneer who
didn't move
um i think donald's gonna have to run to
where the victims are and try to
knock the first victim on the floor
sorry so
the one behind dr hollister who's yeah
welcome all right
are you gonna wrote them down because
they're just standing there on the blood
you have not been on the stage yet so
make me up
a power roll when you're up on the stage
would be a hard success there you go all
right so
there's that brief moment of static
electricity but
you you are fine and um
you yeah you just tackle
one of the you just tackle one of the
the you know one of the guests out of
the way
uh that is that is no problem make me
a dex role
there you go yeah you you manage um
you use the person to keep from getting
blood all over you
as you as you tackle them down
um all right alexandra
this feels to you a little bit like
being in the tub of goo
because you are aware
um you are aware of what's going on
and you can see it all through a sheen
but you can't do anything
uh you you can see everything that's
going
um yeah make me a power roll so here's
mechanically you're going to make a
power roll and if you make a power roll
you will resist
the the call of this knife
okay do i need anything more than
a normal success we're gonna find out
okay
uh 48 just made it is that a
regular success right this is an opposed
role
nope the knife is good so um
can i get a reroll on that friends yeah
that's good
yeah i will second that yep thank you
yes 10. that's a critical success you
beat the knife
you hear a voice in your head
history cannot be denied and another
pulse
shoots out from the knife and everyone
in the building needs to make
another power rule so joan donald
hollister
you don't slice anybody this round um
but every time you don't slice
uh anybody the knife is going to send
out one of those pulses
um get this thing out of my hand oh also
uh
um so it says history cannot be
denied
and you feel like a little cut in your
hand
and you take a point of damage and you
notice that you're you can see that your
honestly i i would imagine based on how
powerful this thing is that if i
move beyond just like holding it out and
away
i i may lose control i mean
if you can try just putting it down
that's the very
like what what what are what are the
other options
are you trying to are you trying to to
to psycho her dr hollister
break my wrist take it off of me you
trying to psycho her
i can't do that i'm not asking you i'm
physically incapable of
i know i'm not asking you all right
that was on a on a 70 the
auctioneer finally dies
60. professor lam yes
do i see him yeah you can see him
right ahead
there was a brief when that pulse went
out like he like
paused for a second but i i i could
catch up to him because that's sex role
this would be that opposed next role
finally i'm sorry
you broke up a little bit for me uh
i didn't make it guess
what do you think you could also spend
luck or push the roll
luck wouldn't do it but your dex is
like 60 something
mydex is 65. push it push it
push it okay
it means you're you're you're going to
be a little reckless like if it goes
wrong something bad is going to happen
you have to describe like
what are you doing
pushing the roll means you're going to
get a re-roll you're going to like
tell me what you're doing that will
allow you to sort of redouble your
efforts if you make it
great everything's fine if you don't
make it
then something off it's like you phone
okay that's it i am going to push it
because that's where jones is
right now she's after this guy yeah
all right they don't say that he one of
the cards that he threw in front of you
was a sliding cart and you jump on it
and you're
like you're you're skating on it i i was
going to do something similar but i was
going to jump off the cart on you know
like
oh perfect yeah you're like you you use
yes i got 39 this time so all right so
yeah you this thing rolls up close to
him and you've now
caught up with this guy no problem
um hey i wonder whatever happened to
that purple cloud um
i it won't come up it'll be no i
i gotta get this guy because then if i
can get his stuff i might be able to
take care of it so oh sure that sounds
like something could happen
yeah i wa at the end of the i want to
take a second to
uh thank elderbrat one who is this
i mean apparently this episode is
brought to you by elder brown
uh she just gave out ten subscriptions
in the chat oh my lord
nice thank you that is uh
uh really what are you thinking that's
epic
that is outstanding so thank you
elder brat
uh very good um
and wine turned nightingale is asking
for a salt and pepper emoji
i guess it would be a silt and piper
it's only eyes that get changed you know
that
i don't think there are any vowels in
her world um
all right except there's an e in her
name but that
sultan pepper all right uh
dr hollister so is has alexandria frozen
so yeah you see the hand with the knife
like twitches
and starts to come forward and then it's
like
the like this the muscle in her arm is
like holding itself back
if if i i'm taking full i will drop the
chair
and grab her hand okay
yeah so this is going to be an opposed
strength role between alexandria and dr
hollister
you know better me than just about
anyone else because my strength is not
good
ew oh just say that i hold on
all right so a slap fight ensues
uh and your hands are very
slick with blood and her hand has blood
on it and nobody has hold of anybody
uh back to the top of the lineup donald
uh
do we do we actually want to inspire me
i'll second that here i'm good
go for it i want this thing out of my
hands and if it gets a bottle i'm
getting my wrist broken
oh god no it's a an amy but not an emma
all right well you are not an undisputed
amy king
yes that is painful
we need amy back so she can reclaim her
throne
dr hollister dropped that folding chair
right yes
dropped the chair and he is like trying
to wrestle with alexandra russell
he he hates to do this but it's he's not
going to think mud up very long it's
going to be
it's a quick moment it's quick he knows
what he has to do he grabs that folding
chair
and with the side of it i'm not flat but
slide going down
it's basically going to try to nail
alexandria's hand
right where she's holding that dagger
just trying to knock it out
and it's going to hurt but he's got to
get that out of her hand all right
my hand is right now sorry yours is a
little bit
down on my arm i think make a fight
brawl
roll all right that's a 30 on a versus
so regular success all right so that's a
uh what did i say a d4 plus your damage
bonus
all right which i think it's just
regular
yeah that's two okay so alexander you
take two points of damage
uh no reaction at all as you crack that
thing down
and the knife is still there yeah and i
uh
the knife is still in it well you've
loosened it you've lost
i was gonna say he came like right down
at the very least tendons might have
jumped open
uh it's gonna take more than that it
took a gunshot of 12 points to get the
other guy to
do it no it only took two damage from a
after the rest of us softened him up for
you dear yeah
i'm pretty sure the the magic powers
of this folding chair have just been
disproven it is not a folding chair of
knife
cancelling maybe not when i hold it but
uh all right that was 80s alexandra make
i've lost my shield beat the knife
25 just just a hard success well again
um so again there's a
a a a little snick in your hand you take
another point of damage
and donald you see that now
through the knife guard like through her
clinched fingers blood
is coming out of her hand and
like all the muscles are just standing
on on end just like
no no no no no no yeah
okay he's dead nobody died this round
all right
um and joan
you now are right up with this guy you
could tackle him you could do something
what do you want to do
um i i want to try to
um to tackle him and get the the
the mask off okay that's my
thing so make a fight brawl i'm gonna
give you
a penalty i'm gonna give you a bonus
die sorry oh good
okay he would you make that poll i'm
going to
uh i'm going to uh
so elder brat is giving a thousand bits
to the players
to counter the ones that she knows are
coming from jade
the ball is in your court mr matthews
[Music]
so i made
ultimate success i got an o seven with
my
second die the bonus died does it
yeah
yes thank you it would have been bad
otherwise i died of the ground
uh and uh
because it's what you want uh
uh the mask well yeah you tackle this
guy the ground and you just rip the mask
off
um and um
there's just a you know a guy underneath
who's like looking up at you and just
like
um he's like the mask is nothing
you've you've already destroyed this
dave you've doomed us all the curse
tell me about the curse tell me oh
you'll know
soon enough how mean he takes the other
stave
and he throws it down and it shatters
and another cloud of purple mist and he
just looks at you and he says
if i can't have them no one can
uh that was not my first thought
no i i don't know if too many guys who
are uh
bring the world to a freaking end so
it's if i
if i can't have them no one can i don't
know
whoa i'm way over here you can't hit me
where's that table now i'm bringing it
on the bar
flies across oh that's
that's okay that's the bit we need
forget the police story bit
we need a bit where like somebody like
goes like this
off screen and then bam somebody gets
hit you know like
that's the bit we need that would be a
great bet
uh so yeah you uh
uh professor lam it's at that point
when this purple mist starts to coalesce
into something
yeah you hear like um
clap clack clap
this sound these very slow steps
okay so this guy is not doing anything
he's
no he's just working now angrily
as he threw down a a whole bunch of
stuff
you're just in a hallway so it's not too
it's not too dark
yeah okay you know anything yet all you
see right now
the guy is just looking scornfully up at
you purple cloud coalescing to your left
something awful coming towards you that
you can't that you can hear coming from
okay
uh that was his action dr hollister
excellent we're having our wrastlin
match i'm gonna try and try her face
jeez i mean
it's just a med roll i'm 12 away but no
you can spend luck all right not that
but you know what
i'm i'm pushing digging in
do it or i would love it if you push
this
i am just like so up until now i've been
trying to avoid
getting cut while getting now it's just
like
funny story like i can't i'm turning
i've turned my arms around i'm just
trying to get in there and if i get
sliced i get sliced
okay i made it all right so yeah you you
now have both hands
on alexandra's knife arm
and it it you can feel
um there's a weird there's a
weird tension
it actually feels like she is pulling
her
arm back with like all the strength she
can
so when you grab on there's like a brief
second where you're like whoa what i'm
why are you we were trying to pull this
the same direction what's going on here
um all right top of the lineup
donald and dr hollister need to make
power rolls
i got 20. so all right yeah everything's
fine oh i forgot uh
all right i forgot but i did not send
out a pulse of energy last time even
though it didn't kill anybody
uh donal so right now
um the knife is still in alexandria's
hand yes
and dr hollister's holding it like
with both hands trying to keep her arm
from with blood trickling between her
fingers
well i'm not trying to keep her arm
still i'm trying to pry her fingers off
of it
interesting all right well we'll deal
with that when we deal with that
all right i think donald sees it
looks like the doctor is actually making
some progress he actually has a couple
fingers loose
does it look like he's doing something
positive here no he's just finally
gotten
control like he now has control of her
arm the ground is very slippery
that's my excuse donald's going to step
in
um right behind alexandria okay
and basically grab her from behind with
both arms
and put both hands on her wrist all
right keep first just keep her isolated
keep her wrists set try to help the
doctor
so 09 it's a good role for me
that's the extreme success on strength
that's a good role for me and i have low
strength
so so dr hollister
you will in the opposed in the
opposed fight with alexander next
in this round your your role is just is
going to be one success better
because of what he did because he got a
critical success
oh thank you so your si your success
will be one better
in that opposed role um
all right alexandra make a power roll
okay please make it
ought to there you go all right so now
uh there's another uh
uh you take another point of damage man
i'm rolling crappy
i'm not you know why this is not a bird
of paradise though i am glad you're not
only a word of paradise because i am
slowly bleeding out through my hand
i need to be rolling a bird of paradise
that's what i need to be doing probably
with like bruises growing on
on my wrist and arm where these people
are grabbing me it's
it's yeah your arm is not feeling great
um all right
uh and everybody in the building
needs to make a power roll
i just made a ponytail if 50 is a
success
now he fails failed
oh the dude all right so joan the guy
below you
uh his eyes glaze over and
um the smirk leaves his face and he is
oh okay well i'm i'm gonna get the heck
out of there that guy didn't he he
the staff the purple the whatever's
coming after i'm gonna go back and tell
everybody else
well that's that's not getting out of
there that's going towards it
oh i thought it was coming up the purple
thing is behind you the purple thing is
you and the party you'd have to get out
of the building yeah
all right yep yep yep well wherever that
purple thing is
i i was thinking there was something
else coming you're about to find it
yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna i i this
point i'm running
okay where are you running away are
you running out of the building are you
running towards your friends
i need to get back to my friends okay so
you are heading back
towards whatever that quack quack quack
okay yes
yes so i've got my i've got my
crowbar
you let up you let this guy up and he
starts to walk
like in a trance the same direction
you're going
um and you are zooming ahead of him
and as you turn the corner coming down
the hallway
taking up most of the hallway
uh is some a
a figure a statue that you had noticed
in that exhibit hallway it is one of
china's famous terracotta
warriors and it is
clack clack and all through it is this
purple energy
that is just just like coruscating
through it
and clack clap it is implacably
uh all right that is uh
that was 60s and there's
and and it's at that point you think hey
there's another one of those purple
clouds around here
okay that was 60s we get down to dr
uh the the terracotta warriors go dr
also what's your decks
uh 35. they go before
wow i thought it would be great to put
my dumpster in that there you go
all right i mean if you want to make
sure you go last in combat sure
so on a 35 this massive terracotta
warrior
um for dramatic effect will um
just absolutely crush the poor guy in
the uh
the poor guy in the trance was like
keeping up with you
and the terracotta warrior just goes
clap
and his head is in between its hands and
his head is no longer there when his
got memories i just have memories oh
crap
what all right ezra and his terracotta
warriors
yep the terracotta warriors before he's
although this is this is kind of
merciful he's he's thrown them
he's used them in much worse ways i
don't want to go into it but yeah but
yeah
yeah okay well running sounds like a
good option right now all right so yeah
he
brushes the guy in front of you the the
warrior does yeah
uh all right it is the top of the round
uh
oh hollister sorry yes so i'm going to
make that strength check
do it and you're one more than whatever
level you get
and i'm still like at this point given
everything that's happened just
in advance i'm i'm pretty much frantic
and i am not
like again if i slice myself open trying
to pry her fingers off like that's just
oh oh my god okay so that's a critical
so what so i got one higher than a a
step higher than higher than a critical
yeah wow they're true all right because
the pinky's the the one that gives the
easiest don't
okay all right so alexandra this
is an opposed strength roll so make your
strength oh please
my strength is 35 yeah i got a 40 i got
a 48 that was a fail
all right uh
real good man make it real good i just
like yeah i was hoping this was just
gonna drop on the ground
it's it's a regular success okay well
with a regular success like
as you go to like pry her fingers off
like your
thumb grazes the hilt of the knife
and in your head you hear a voice that
says
history will not be denied
and you just like shake it off and you
continue to like try and pry the hands
off
but now you are giving you're giving the
knife a wide berth
uh all right um
so that's now donald and dr hollister
you both need to make power rolls you
are
on the stage come on guys 47 regular
success
all right i finally failed a power roll
oh let's inspire that we want to inspire
that i really do
you're the one getting this thing out of
my hand
oh god i feel like an emma's coming on
oh god that would be outstanding no
that's that's a a hard success all right
so there is a brief moment where you
feel like
again that static electricity passed
through you but then everything's fine
uh all right donal all right we're
making progress making progress
and and alexandria isn't resisting so
he'll continue to hold her still
as best you can okay do that just keep
her pinned in there
and let the doctor finish getting her
fingers off make me that strength roll
another strength roll this is uh
yeah but another hard success all right
oh wait a heart or a critical
that's a hard success okay so so
you're gonna have
for for a hard success not a critical
success you're gonna have a bonus die
on your role dr hollister i like how i
pointed at you as if you could
as if we could see you i know the
telepathy was working i got it there it
was there
uh all right alexandra power roll
40. made it sometime you guys need to
miss a
i i have birds of paradise man they're
working for me too
uh so yeah the you you resist again
and they're like and like lean i can
feel it i imagine i can feel them
because there's a haze but i'm still
aware so i can feel them
helping me yeah and being like get this
uh you take
three points of damage thank you birds
of paradise

for the moment the knife is sitting on
the ground so donald you
are going first you see this bloody
knife
uh lying in a massive pool of

what are they doing step over this guy
yeah i i'm i'm stepping over as well

can't really easily be identified yeah
you are though you guys aren't listening
to me
do you guys joan there was a dagger that
was making people kill people
we were dealing with kind of a lot no no
no but now
now now we're still moving you talk walk
and talk yeah
a time portal was being opened up to
ancient times
i don't think i stopped to make a
history role oh a gown
i felt a gown but that i thought that
was just
okay i thought that was the purple haze
on my brain but what have you been
doing
i've been was trying to track down what
was happening to the staves
and some of the other things all the
boxes are empty in the back
okay all right um
so you are now out on the street of rome
three of you
drenched in blood um
how such a good question
right there you can stop just you could
just stop it how
i don't know i don't know does anyone
have any ideas
yes we're going to the hospital right

travel the streets of rome
back to your hotel uh
with three bloody people
one unbloody person

thoughts vis-a-vis a terracotta warrior
and some other horror that has been
unleashed on rome
so we will be back just as soon as five

[Music]
[Applause]
welcome back so let's get right to it
you are in front of the oh

thomas
to the point that he decided we're gonna
give away a mug
so it is hashtag mug to win
a mug i'll just say mug one more time
uh there we go so that's that so you are
standing
outside of the um
of the the auction house
and you are several of you are covered
in blood
three out of the four joan probably has
some brain and stuff on her from uh
the guy who got squished and
where are you going what are you doing
is there are there any when i
came around did i see any water faucets
did i recognize anything like that i was
like just going too fast
you were running for your friends yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah what's the vehicle
situation like all the guests must have
had cars in there they arrive
uh so the cars were all uh
ballet valet thank you that's what i was
anywhere so there's like two guys
hmm what can we do can we can we do
anything with
uh clothing do i have extra clue i can
give somebody a vest we can try to
put over somebody yeah so most of you
actually ran out without your jackets
uh because you just took off
uh so i have my daggers though i've got
all my tigers back on
yes you've got your daggers
i can buy a new jacket yeah i was just
trying to think of how to get us out of
here
right now because you guys don't want
to go and
on a scale of one to the world ending
what would you rate it i don't know
that's the problem
all i know is that there is a a a golem
of
and something else that was in a crate
was it was it like the lion back
chased us all the way through the city
that we could not fight
well this is more it it it shuffles
um but it's
it's it's it's it smashed the guy's head
in front of me
right comparing it to that lion who was
chasing us of the city of
shanghai what do you think is it better
worse the same
really i got that let's see
got it give me a thumbs up all right no
no
50 50. all right i'm gonna roll 50 50.
can we find somewhere to clean up please
that's stoked you hear the you hear the
familiar whistles
of police uh
a police activity and somebody
just walking by the street looks and
like
sees three people covered in blood and
like
um you have no problem in in uh
in italian alexandra he's like oh no are

like standing here sort of
watching what's going on very concerned
okay um
which direction did we come from to go
to the hotel do you get from the hotel
you took a cab here yeah but which
direction on the street
uh you would go left okay words the
whistles are away from the whistles
i want to go away from the whistles yeah
the suit right
dr hollister make me a luck roll
that's an 11 which is very much a
success all right so yeah going towards
your hotel is away from the police
whistles sweet okay
all right but yeah i i will i will make
a bit of a show of of being hurt and
leaning on on them but like
moving away toward it towards getting
help unless we need to get her out of
here
you're making a show of being hurt
i'm for some italian well it's i'm not
going to say that
so this guy this guy is like no no
you're hurt you stay you stay
i i'll i'll i'll reply this this man is
is my doctor he's
he's tending to me i'm all right
tranquil quilo
and it's in spite of in spite of
everything
that startles a laugh out of alexandria
uh okay yeah so uh
you know he once he sees the third
guy carrying the bloody chair
i dropped it i put the chair down that's
true he he hit the person with the drop
dead
that's right oh i dropped it outside
there's a block
outside this guy is just like maybe i
don't want to be around here and he
starts to like
walk away very quickly we're walking
away very quickly now too
sure thank you so it's going to be
your hotel is a couple miles from here
so let's go okay
on the way i want to like try to find a
a restaurant or a bar or something where
there's like a hose in the back that we
can hose down at least
so fountains are all over the place you
can easily find fountains
um as far as the restaurant um
you can find restaurants but you know
asking them for their hoses
you know three bloody people walking in
asking
joan's not flooded
uh every time like joan seems to be like
constantly looking away like very
extractedly like
yeah yeah no i i keep thinking those
things do i hear anything do i hear the
clack clack do i hear anything else
you you will be hearing that clacking
sound for the rest of your life
let's let's just use a fountain first
fountain we'll take a dip
all right so yeah you you find a
fountain and you can
you can get reasonably cleaned off
tourists you know
at night away from
people you know away from light it won't
be obvious that you
are covered in blood it will be
obvious that your clothes are very wet
but you know that's
uh something else in rome we did
yeah and i'm i'm still like holding my
hand like a wounded bird and feeling
like i
hollister i'm gonna need you to have a
look at this yeah you gotta get back to
the hotel and get to my bag
please but not the worst injury i've
ever taken but
it's my hand so joan you're you're
friends
i'm sorry about that are not doing
anything about this danger that has been
unleashed on the city
yeah you unleashed on the city
at night now you're like sitting on the
edge of a fountain that is now like
blood red as they like rinse off the
blood
from themselves it's diluted it's more
cool red
okay so i understand that you're hurt
and that things are happening but
they there are two at least two
things out there that could start
killing people do we want to be
responsible for that
what happened how are we responsible for
in the back room when i went back there
there all the boxes of everything were
opened
there was a guy he had one of the masks
on which i have i'm going to show them
the mask
yeah does it look like that golden mask
that
i i would remember from when emma
handled it
no the this is a much nicer very kind of
greek or roman you know much more
stylized mask that that
the mask from um
peru was like block just a like a block
of gold that you put on your face this
is much more
of a almost like the the traditional
greek
drama mask or something out of curiosity
hasn't done it here i'm just curious
does it feel like it is a gold mask
yeah this is made out of solid gold and
so and he also had
wow yeah he also had these two staves
now
i wanted the staves but he
threw them on the ground and when he did
they exploded with purple
haze sounds like he dodged a bullet
there john
i i we could have done something good
with them but he
he said now i've unleashed it and now
and so
but i went to go i still went after him
he ran away
and then when i i finally caught up to
him again
i should have seen it man that was a
great leap anyway i i got
i got him and i was that's how i got the
mask
and he said you know you've unleashed it
on the world and we heard this crack
but there was this terra cotta warrior
you know those you saw those
those those big statues that they had in
the front those terracotta warriors
one of them became alive
and squished the guy's head
right in front of me and i i knew
you guys would be able to help tame or
get rid of this creature i couldn't do
it all by myself so i ran to get you
you guys can do that no no
come on it's terra cotta we could figure
out terracotta where do i put a dagger
into that
how how can i do and how can i do
anything just something
all right we have explosives we have
guns we have things to shoot
we have things to crack with but i
couldn't do it myself
look you said it just like that was it
yeah we don't have
any of the explosives with us they're
all back at the hotel
and you're not going up against one of
those with the crowbar you'll die
be clear you don't actually have any
explosives yeah we do oh
oh that's right you have the dynamite we
got the dynamite because because donald
and i drove the the
the truck all right so and
and then so he had one one more stave
and
that one got dropped to the ground when
he got squished
and that came out purple the purple haze
went into a crate
i did not stick around to see what
happened but i heard
i i thought you said he threw both
staves at the ground no one
so joan just to be clear you're not
you're not talking about the fact that
you yanked at this thing for whatever
reason you're not telling them the story
and that's totally cool
um but i just want to make sure that
like if you're trying to intentionally
deceive them that's one thing
um i didn't i did tell them i tried to
get it
yeah but then he threw it on the ground
right yeah you said
yeah and then but you also said he threw
this you said he threw the first one on
the ground which is yeah
yeah okay yeah just checking yeah i
tried to get it
um and then you know that she she's
got some problems with that in her mind
too so anyway
and i don't know what it created
i genuinely don't know what we can do
against terra cotta with a handful of
daggers
a gun and the ability to ko someone with
a folding chair
in a crowbar also her hand is sliced
open
and influence of some sort of
ritual sacrifice magic all right well we
got we got to tell the higher ups then
we gotta tell
when he says that everyone's eyes turn
to that shoe box sitting on the edge of
the fountain
well that should not just be someone is
definitely with that at all times
so yeah are we hailing a taxi now that
we're mostly playing not bloody
let's get back to the hotel fix up and
we can discuss this problem
i think we walk a little bit further
just so we're further away from
where all the whistles and sirens are
and then get a cab
is there any way anywhere to get
yeah you don't even you like it would
be
you could find a concrete factory or
some cement
factory or something like that but it
would be uh
um definitely during the day and you'd
need to like ask some people
they don't just have bags of concrete's
not a thing right now
cement is but you know you need to find
like a hardware store
yeah a hardware store okay yeah tomorrow
uh that's that's on the top of my list
shoe box full of concrete
and one dagger here's here's the thing
joan i
don't like leaving things undone either
i really don't
but i don't know what we can do about
that i think the best that we're going
to be able to do
is get a hold of rogers and tell him
what happened
and see if we can't get delta green
assistance on this
all right at that point somewhere
where was that yeah we're all turning in
uh you see you know you're you're in
a us
you're in a fairly urban area so you you
know but
you definitely see like an orange cloud
kind of in the distance lifting up
hers are more subtle they creep up on
you and then you realize
oh the city's on fire you almost made me
snort my drink
yeah that was pretty good that was good
but yeah i i think i think we get back
to the hotel yes
and we report into rogers because this
is over our heads this is
a big enough that we will die probably
and i
i'd rather in a hotel picture is back
just make sure rogers doesn't think you
did this john
right it wasn't it was nothing to do
with this
right this is this is this this is the
man in the mask that you told us about
he did this absolutely that's entirely
that fellow's fault
in the masks yes yes he's the one who
had the staves
right okay because when you first told
us you were kind of like oh we're
responsible for this
i was hoping that we could solve it
since we are the people who solve things
okay but that's just not the same thing
as we're responsible for the carnage
that it unleashes
just clearing that up should i make a
psychology role you might need to man
i don't know what's the lying
[Music]
it's not who's lying stating the truth
fortunately my psychology is not super
high
i'm just enjoying i think our episode
title might be we are not responsible
for the carnage that results
no idea i like it that's ours that's our
subtitle of every episode
we wash our hands of this look if there
if there's anything that a lifetime of
doing this kind of work has taught me
it's that you use the right tool for the
job
and we are not the tool to handle
massive terracotta warriors
especially right now this is an idea
yeah i i i can see you guys are beat up
just
just it's hard to turn away from stuff
no i i understand that and
i like looked i looked down at my hand
briefly and just like nope can't look
i'm really hurt joan and there was kind
of a lot going on in there my head is
but your hair looks great you know what
i will take that
so you eventually make it back to the
hotel very good
um and the
uh the front desk guy when you ask for
your keys
uh he's he he says oh
are you all right you you you weren't in
the explosion were you
you look hurt he speaks english right
yeah we fell in a fountain it was funny
what explosion what's what explosion are
you talking about brother uh
there's in the in the garment district
there's
some sort of have been a
a couple buildings have fallen down and
well i have to make a psychology role on
we'll see what jones reaction is you
might have to
uh it is yeah the police are
trying to figure it out in the fire
department
and there's been some sort of mass
murder
downtown oh my god what is this city
coming to can i use your phone
what on earth is going on
um this is a terrible night it's a
terrible night
we thought we had it bad yeah
yeah yeah yeah there's a he'll he'll
take you to the back office
yeah well we'll go up to the room yeah
yeah
and i'll make a a call to delta green
all right you have
uh it's late at night so it is kind of
early morning there it's about a 12 hour
difference
um so you are you know you know the
you know the the code word to get put
through to rogers
oh i don't have to go directly to rogers
i'm just leaving
just a message yeah i'm leaving a
message
someone else will rush it to rogers um
so you don't have to deal with it yeah
but yeah all right so so you
what what do you want your message to
say
that that some sort that that it some
like what two
apparently two golems were unleashed
and are currently destroying buildings
in rome
we are not equipped for this um
it was caused by some sort of evil
sorcerer that was stopped by
uh professor lam we
also obtained a
incredibly dangerous relic and
we are we're we're doing our best to
keep it secure but we
would like to request a secure pick up
for it
uh additional additional
measures are going to be taken before
we're comfortable releasing it
but just just have something but just to
have something ready
in over the next couple of days to uh
all right yeah you leave that message
[Music]
okay yeah i think they're five hours
behind us
over there in dc oh right i think of
everything as the west coast
five hours then it's the evening yeah
late afternoon or evening
yeah you leave a message there
uh and i'm gonna get you know what
before i get changed i'm gonna
work on alexandria's hand all right do a
little first aid
uh not i'm not so much for first aid can
i just go directly to the actual
uh medicine so medicine is is
so medicine is much like psychotherapy
it's a long-term treatment thing
yeah i'm not i'm not like putting gauze
on it i'm looking if stitches need to be
done
okay sure make me a medicine roll i mean
first aid can also tell you that but
you're gonna yeah sure make me a
medicinal
usually someone else has done that
for me by the time it reaches me
uh that is a hard success all right um
it seems like she has deep but not
not like there's no muscle damage or
anything like that
but she has deep cuts in her hand
all right then i'll look how how about
is it doc will i be able to use it again
uh eventually but i i think you need to
uh
lay off it for a while i can if i can
fashion some sort of like
well i think are the are the cuts do
they look like they need stitches or i
can i tape those and then i figure i
want to
inhibit her hand movement so it can uh
it look yeah it looks like wrapping her
hand
will be the the best result that's gonna
be fine this is this is
this is nothing for alexandra she's been
hurt a lot worse than this doctor
well that's not an excuse to aggravate
it
and it's not usually damage on my hands
you know how i need my hands the tendons
for now yeah it looks good but again
like let's make sure it doesn't get
infected
don't aggravate it and
painkillers do not
do not for the love of the gods do not
give me morphine or i will stab you when
or just like aspirin but aspirin's fine
i need to be cognizant more fiends for
me
that's how i get through the night fair
enough
do i do i get any hp back from him uh
no he did medicine medicine was seo
sorry
first aid would give you some back
immediately you'll get one
uh back for resting overnight
do we want to do first aid for other
things like the bruises or
i i could try some first aid yeah go for
it you can yeah go donald
you can yeah i failed i'm sorry do you
want me to follow up
yeah it looks fine may i yeah put some
dirt in it
man first april sure yeah um
as everyone stands for that i'm just
like
y'all need to back up no i'm i'm not
i'm not just hovering i'm not hovering
not my thing
uh you guys go to sleep i guess
uh precautions are being made with this
uh this is the evening of may 8th
yeah that shoe box um
god how badly do i need to say no may
8th 18.
oh yeah may 18. i did i have the one on
one side and then i scribbled out the
the 10 the the ones and so i was like
wait a minute we did that delivery on
the 16th
18th the evening of may 18th well thank
you
ah donald do you want can can you take a
watch tonight
okay that's not a problem like yes i can
do that all right
just to put barriers around this shoe
box like taking out a drawer and putting
it on it upside down and
yeah sure you can do that i i think we
should take turn taking watches
so that no one is well you need to rest
yeah you if you take a watch you won't
get that point back
take a rest i will i will i will take a
watch i will take a watch
dan i'm not tired anyway it's fine i'll
i'll keep an eye on things
all right i'll make make my slow
exhausted way to
to my bed and just like face plant
yeah as usual you guys have somehow
every hotel has a suite of rooms with
like a central
foyer so you have like a central foyer
area so
in the like in the middle of the floor
of this boy is a shoe box with a drawer
on top of it and like
okay i think and yeah okay
so you all go to sleep
uh professor lam make me
no all right so
you are just wracked with
guilt and dreams in your dreams
a that terra cotta warrior
is just like almost
comically killing
increasingly like innocent groups like

basically as soon as he's out of like
the close of the door he like sprints
away
close the door be nice if we could do
well how soon do we think until a
hardware store is open
well it's about eight probably ten ten
well
let's get some breakfast and i've got
the the satchel under my arm
so the newspaper
the english language newspaper is full
of stories
about destruction all through
there's been some sort of
bomb all throughout rome and
um the more lurid parts of the stories
refer to a mummy and
a walking statue neat
look at this john those are
troublemakers
i i i would also ask for an italian
language newspaper
to try to get the more well news side of
things and
then the yellow journalism side well you
should not go with the italian press
the english press is any better uh
so yeah the the italian press is full of
just like
there's a mummy walking the streets of
rome and it's
an and a st a walking statue that is
knocking down
buildings
a gas main blew up because of this
destruction
and the police have shut down the
entire garment district no one's going
joan you can't blame yourself that
fellow
he he unleashed it when he when he
destroyed the states
those sorts of things hold a lot of
power and the staves i think controlled
it
you can't blame yourself i wanted them i
now that fellow if you got those stuff
what was he going to use them for
exactly he might have done worse than
we are caught between a bunch of really
except for breakfast it's a good choice
oh that is long but that is an excellent
episode title
between a bunch of bad choices except
for breakfast
yeah and alexandra isn't using her her
right hand for for breakfast she's kind
of picking at it with her left
i'm gonna get i'm gonna get such an
omelet
[Music]
okay uh
dreams they're kind of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] aren't
they
when you when when donald says do you
want to talk to the doctor about it
you hear a voice say you could talk to
me
about it i visibly flinch
and like try to try to figure out where
that came from
and like stepping out of the veranda
of your room
like just forcing the door open
what have you done to my city
we didn't do a damn thing i think i want
to kind of slowly re
walk casually just to my room just
casually
he's totally not yeah um
i'm standing in front of the chair that
i was in my hand near one at one of my
dagger spots but not on
this moment we didn't do a damn thing we
were in the wrong place at the wrong
time
things exploded a dozen people a dozen
souls
and i got none of them you poor thing
yeah 12-gauge shotgun
12 there were only eight there oh
and you know the guy whose head got
squished also you know there were cut
there were some other
that's fair did you release
who is controlling the mummy no one
i want to be like if you want us to
i smell magic
fantastic we seem to seem to get the
stuff around us
have i got my fire extinguisher yet i
got my shotgun was waiting by the door
just for
just in case yeah what's in that
well now i'm interested you were
i'll give you the capstone for it now
actually i'm going to kick hollister in
the egg and if i close up to hollister
and kick him in the ankle
give this thing give this thing to that
thing
oh he'll just end up killing himself
with it
i don't know i i i don't think his his
chances are very good
possession you had souls
what oh it's in her dossier
of souls am i thinking of something
different
yeah i don't know souls the sucking
of pow
oh okay oh yeah that
but but newer magic
she's been spritzed
you got the staves at the auction
no we did not or
you wouldn't be here
you broke the stair you
you freed them no there was another dude
i was trying to get the staves
i have to go
and he like starts to walk you guys
with all your guns can come in the room
he's walking to the uh
to the veranda
well should i should i
should you let me be in the room when
you do that
i'll do it if you do it i got your back
he's about to fly off
get him i'm waiting on you go
right i'll i'll i'll use the all right
both of you make me luck rolls
gonna say i will stab both of you
costello rookie i got an o5
so for good luck thank god i mean i i
made it
uh yeah so you uh
you you stop the after you know after
you just in time you can each
yeah you can each take a shot right he's
just like
um like it it's it's almost like a um
you don't need you you sort of expect
this but it's very much like
a a ladybug where his back
kind of distends and wings come out of
it
what is what does one roll for i'd
have to go up to him but what is
yeah you have to be very close
um you uh
i'm i'm basically holding my action
until after the doctor does his thing i
don't want to
shoot him and make a big loud explosion
if i don't have a deep breath
and then i'm a fumble here
come on man and then i roll at 21. well
there you go
all right so everything works just as
you hoped
you pumped this thing and a thin stream
of insecticide
just goes shooting out highly
pressurized oh it's not
it's not the no no this is like a
straight line kind of zapping in oh i i
i i was thinking
okay that'll be fine this will be fine
i'm going to dart for one of the rooms
and close the door i do not want to be
in the room
to breathe this stuff because it's not
it's a powder it's all powder
yeah so it's it's powder but the
the accelerant is what makes it not is
like
the you know the the the liquid is that
so it's
it becomes it's a liquid as it's coming
out
and that's why you're glad that it's not
a cloud
possibly no i i'm just use i've i've
used different kinds of fire
extinguishers so in my head was it
different
okay so you shoot this thing out
and it it hits him square in the back
right as he's about to take off
i totally could hear that he makes a a
very good
con roll and he is still gonna try
um
one two yep he's still gonna try and fly
away so
before he flies away donald i'm gonna
make you an offer
so you have a shotgun is what you picked
up yeah
so doctor you can take a penalty die
and not shoot dr hollister
or you can take a regular shot and you
know
gotta break some eggs break some eggs
cool i mean i i guess donald's hope was
that the insecticide would work and the
shotgun's like a backup plan
but we have no idea in this moment if it
actually has any effect
so that with that lack of knowledge
he's not to get shot but i don't want it
the doctor so all right so
so take the penalty die no don't take
the penalty die don't take the pen
don't take the penalty die i don't want
to kill you don't take the penalty guy
you wouldn't don't take the penalty back
i'll do that no no here's the thing oh
my god
here's the thing if he shoots the doctor
the doctor is it close to point blank
that's 46.
yeah i don't hate the doctor i got a 69
with my firearms rifle my skill was 82.
so shotgun is a different skill than
rifle yeah
fire rifle shock in the same category
michael's stock gun all right
then yeah blam all right you uh
you make it so roll 2d6
for damage or not so close but
there is a a loud blam
all through the area and how much
six points all right and
one thing you do notice is that it seems
like scaravetti
is normally like very armored
but because the pesticide is like
burning out and because his wings are
out
the shot goes right through and like he
dips a little as he flies but he flies
away
oh wreck that
watch him fly away all right can i how
fast is he flying away
you hear police whistles again oh crap
as a shotgun goes off
all right what's our story guys somebody
tried to get into our
oh no we're still how fast is he flying
away do i have time to grab
my handgun and take some parting shots
uh
sure yeah you can draw your handgun and
i am but you'll you'll get one more and
uh donald your shot he's going to be out
of shotgun range pretty quickly
this is great i'm going to miss all of
these because i'm taking
my three shots at disadvantage oh nice
he's going auto blam blam blam
you roll 100 i swear by all of this
okay so the first shot hits okay for
nine damage
okay now from here on out we don't have
to work
there's no way that i'm going to yeah oh
i fumbled but nowhere near and
humbled no no fumble oh not a fumble
nope so i i managed to hit him once
you get him with the first one and again
there's like a dip and he
uh he looked back and like over the
winds
doctor that pesticide do you think it
worked any effect on him at all
given its size
might be a couple days week month
then he might just croak
it definitely like was there was an
immediate
almost like kind of acid reaction where
it hit his carapace
you were saying at that point there's a
knock on the hood on the door
all right i'm going to stash the shotgun
probably a good idea oh i hand you can i
hand you hand you the uh
the handgun hello front desk hello
um he's hello
we're watching the television sorry the
sound was up high
what's a television crap radio
is the time period correct
um were those uh
were those gunshots i need to please
open this door
yeah i pop open yeah we're watching a a
a crime
listening to a crime show
um we had the that was a very loud radio
yeah we're sorry about that i see
um i mean would you like to inspect to
make sure there's no
bullet hole or anything crazy like that
donald make me a luck roll
please that's a failure for me
okay yeah yeah i think i should
um scoozy um
and he points in like the the shotgun
cloud
um at the veranda has like
torn into the wood there's like pellets
all through it and the curtain is all
in bad shape you fired buckshot yeah
that's how you do 46 at close range yeah
it works that works much better okay if
there was buckshot
sorry my i just assumed if someone's
using a shotgun
you you assumed a slug i assume a slug
like you're shooting an armored carapace
insect buckshot is the one thing i would
expect not to be used
so my apologies i i i could not fathom
didn't have time to change the ammo on
that thing it was already preloaded the
guy from the hotel is like
um my english is only so so but
um why are you what buck shot and what
did you shoot a shotgun in this room so
so but it no if it's
if it's buckshot can i uh
uh retcon that because i was under the
impression that we were
like just do it do it uh
what you want you don't want to let the
guy in the room not no not if not if
buckshot was fired and
the pellets are all in the all right
yeah he's like um
please i need to come you
i need to come in and make sure
everyone's okay
let me put pants on one minute you

off a crime drama
yeah and i'll just like rattle it off
i'm sorry that our volume was up too
loud that was
uh incredibly impolite of us and i'm
very sorry
i will need to search this room all
right
he looks at the guy from the front desk
and he says

i'll translate quietly for him for the
others
can i call out if we can order breakfast
we had breakfast what are you talking
about my breakfast yeah i was sitting
picking at it
yeah i missed oh no tell me
um a a ceremonial
uh dagger we are a ceremonial
d a knife it's not sharp we're
we're we're are show it to me sir we are
art purveyors
we are we are here for we were here for
an art auction
and we obtained a dagger art auction
were you going to be at the merloni
house
no different dart auction i saw i saw
what happened in the newspapers that's
terrible
open it show me the knife i'll
very care actually i'll i'll be like
dr hollister would you be so good yeah
i'm making sure there's distance and
you know this is it is
it is an incredibly valuable piece and
we we have
holy crap he rolls in 0-1 why are you
acting like you're afraid of that bag
it's delicate it's delicate and and
and very expensive and weird being
gentle with it as you would understand
if you understood anything about art
sir yeah and i slowly open it up and i'm
just making sure that when i do
it is not within reaching distance and
if he reaches for it i'm closing it
immediately
so you open the box and there you open
the bag and there's just a shoe box
there
oh box no
the knife is in the box right as far as
we know it's in the box no it's in the
box
have i not opened the box no you just
opened the bag
okay i'll i'll reach in and like
touching the very corners of the shoe
box to avoid touching anything very much
i'll like pull it up so he can see it
all right you have been touched by this
knife before make me a power roll
damn it i you were a bad choice
why why did you because you were the one
holding the bag
no i'm i was taking it out why would you
oh thank god it's ought to all right so
you
you reach in let's see if this guy
remains
oh man italian police are on their thing
um you reach in to get this thing and
there is just the slightest
like you are you're you're super in
control of yourself
there's just the slightest trimmer as
you like
and a little exhale as you take the
thing off
um but you you like know that the cop
and he steps forward when you when
you take it off
i'm pulling back equally to him pulling
forward
it is a very valuable art piece sir
please do not handle it we are doing our
how valuable quite
that's not a number how valuable
that depends on the better yes we need
to get it assessed
and bid it on
now as this is not a gun can we close it
the shotgun pellets on this
now look at that what the hell happened
there
yes what indeed i'm putting the lid back
on the box if that's what he's yeah i'll
i'll pass him the lid because i'm like i
felt that trying to take over me again i
like nope nope
still warm i know that you shot a
shotgun
in this room i'm the greatest detective
in italy
you give me that knife i will be rich
and i will leave i will say i found
nothing
not a chance in heaven it's already in
the bag at this point yeah right right
and he's he's been watching that whole
thing he says or
you find out what italy's firearms laws
are
especially for foreigners
like very deliberately look at donal
well he's in his room but he's got his
rifle ready
at this point like just waiting for the
if i had to do it
yeah you've broken up you have
slid the you know you've slid the
door open and um
you could probably i mean he you would
have to step
my hand is not far away from one of my
daggers at this point because i'm not
playing this game
about five minutes before more officers
are here
and five minutes to make a deal with me
in my mind italy's greatest detective is
apparently a corrupt officer
able to be bought off sir
out of curiosity do you know the guests
that we had this morning
you had a guest yes is that who you
you're not aware of what
i'm aware that you're gonna give her
from the u.s
embassy stopped by so would you like to
create an
incident
you're changing the subject not really
oh i'm about to make a phone call
yes no there the phone is downstairs
and they know not to let you leave this
floor
i mean i have thought of everything i
mean they can try to stop us
it'll be entertaining what floor are we
on by the way
will you kill more men you were at the
i bet if i search this room i'll find
bloody clothes
what floor we on no he won't because i
all right fourth third third won't
probably
kill him i thought the same thing
it's very simple give me what i want and
all of your problems go away
sorry i i i i whispered a hollister very
you know just
because you know we're sitting there
with that and i said what about the mask
i can give him the his mask
gold show him the mask
so what i will do is i have my bag
the mask oh his eyes
light up when he
what is that solid gold
it's a mask more than the knife
at least as much if not more solid gold
beautifully worked
old moving this knife would be
incredibly difficult
that gold makes it we have some people
who might
who are looking for the knife so but
this
i would i would trade you this for your
lowering the amount of officers and
and
for your future cooperation yes
for helping us get back out when we need
to
does it turn him into a gremlin or
something what does that mask do
that feels like real gold this must be
this must be a kilogram of gold at a
minimum
and it's beautifully worked so if you
decide to sell it as an art piece it'll
be worth more if you decide to sell it
as the gold
a little bit less but still a king's
ransom
but from here on out we're good friends
yes
yes this this is just what i wanted
i accept and he like slides the thing in
here
if you'll excuse me sorry what is what
is your name sir if we
screw the rifle apart pack it back in
the bag
yes now that now that we are acquainted
yeah
what is your name sir i am i am
i am i am detective vessi
detective vesey pleasure to meet you sir
yes very nice to do business with you
right
now if you'll excuse me i have to go
tell a front desk to not
call some police officers you have a
story to spend
go for it yes have a lovely afternoon
you too and he heads out
oh god thank you
thank you well done thank you joan for
giving that
up yeah i i don't want to shoot that
fella if i didn't have to
yeah no that would have given us a whole
other thing a raft of things
uh i wanted to i wanted to mention that
scarab guy
but scaravetti guy but i mean
is attached to the mob i almost thought
that's who you were talking about when
you were asking if he knew who came here
today
that's what i was thinking maybe if he
had said oh yes i'm well acquainted then
yes but
he seemed to be of the same ilk of
wanting to have
fine things yes we need to get that
thing sealed and concrete as soon as the
store opens
yes out of our hands maybe we can find a
lock box or something too
uh for now a uh
a shoe box full of concrete i think it's
a good first step
and i'm i'm gonna like put some
significant difference between me and
it because i'm remembering the dream
that i had and i do not want to be
anywhere near that thing
just like nope
yeah as soon as as soon as i think that
we can leave
i am and i would love company
i'm like look at my bandaged up hand
well
good thing i'm ambidextrous yeah so you
you uh
you essentially about 10 minutes after
you give him the mask
um you see vessy walk out of the hotel
sort of whistling happy and you know
he's leaving
okay let's go all right so um
who's going with harloff there to get
there together these are errands
john or myself i like how you left me
out of that equation dear
you need to like rest you can stay it's
fine
you don't need to be picking up concrete
away from the knife exactly i'd like to
be well away from
that thing i had a very bad dream and
i'd like to be
i'd like to have several buildings
um well i'm walking out the door who's
coming with i'm going with you
okay all right so the knife is staying
with joan and donal
no but i'm staying with me oh the knife
is going with well wait what
alexander is going to no i'm staying at
the hotel
if you're taking taking the knife with
you i'm not going with you yeah
i know okay who's coming with me and the
knife
that that was the question to ask
fine if the knife is going with him i'll
stay here
you got the knives and stuff we need to
to watch the room
well who's who's going with the doctor
someone ought to take uh
help him out with his arms one of the
two of us
can you go all right i'll be back soon
i'll help him
do the construction project we need to
do and see if it happened
by lunchtime and and and make sure that
nothing happens to him or the dagger
right i understand thank you
all right yeah that's the case can
you tell me how to conceal a 38 on me
there's a couple different places we can
hide that but i'll show you before we go
right here
there's there's there's there are ankle
holsters or small of the back holsters
there's options
yeah so we're gonna pat him down a
little bit and find some loose
portions of his clothing and this is a
good place and all right
probably lower back yep uh
we have one of my favorite call of
cthulhu gm's braden braden5 ash
is in hey he gives tiana a thousand bits
for a tiana for a texan tiana moment
which
uh i'm a little offended by personally
i i'm afraid i'm a little i'm a little
scared to actually try to do texan
because i'm more of a southern bell kind
of
kind of southern accent all right the
key to texan
yeah is the word fire
but instead of fire the word is far
right yeah there you go you got yourself
that kind of thing there
yeah got a lot of fire under their ass
no no not fire
i will tell you i have practiced
southern i have not practiced western
yes so yeah no southern is much more
lilting
and kind of you know a musical texan
is just it's all about hitting the
vowels elongating the vowels
and dropping the ends of words i i used
to be able to do it because one of the
preachers that i listened to a lot as a
kid was i was a texan boy west texan boy
um but it's been easily over a decade
and i've done as much as i can to scrub
that out of my memories
uh apparently when i am when i am
uh tired when you're tired
when i am tired i will say i'm tired
uh the other key to texan is that
in texas y'all is singular and all y'all
is plural i honestly really like i like
that
i i think that's a really great thing
and i've i've borrowed that yeah i i
totally use that one
yeah no i'm it is about as gender

his weird idiosyncrasy and i don't know
if this is the indiana
accent or something he says evra buddy
who's this everybody my friend
stephen host
the spiel podcast like here's what i'm
you know here's what i want to tell
everybody very interesting to
everybody all right we could nerd
out i can nerd out about
i can nerd out about accents forever all
right we'll go we'll go new jersey next
jersey is so hard for me to do one of
the audiobooks i'm working on called for
it and i'm like
i can't i'll just make it let's make it
kind of getting kind of rough and brash
oh man no you just got you got to be
able to you know move the lawn
and do laundry i mean that's your big
thing right there washington
that's that's more like boston though
like park the car no no park the cab
that's totally different
you know so your a's almost become use
yeah okay whereas in in boston you're
saying ah um
park the car shout out
the car in boston yard accents are
genuinely fascinating to me i am not
very good at them which is hilarious
because i'm the professional voice actor
my so you know much like much like
impressions
accents i i have a phrase that gets me
into it yes
and the boston one which you know boston
the boston accent is almost as much a
mindset it's
you think you're better than me yeah
yeah they go there you go i i i i
borrowed a phrase from david tennant for
my scottish accent
the elephant emergency oh nice emergency
you can taste every syllable it's
beautiful
um andrea just said we're like
aaron and warren
talking about movies but we're talking
about accidents
okay fine right the ones
uh that is that is a that is a
castigation well
taken andrea yes yes well happy beer
uh so yeah you you guys head out
to the hardware store and that's it's no
problem
uh you notice that the streets are
pretty empty
no surprise time it's the garment
district though right
are there reports of it escaping
there
not so far oh let's just not go to that
district
let's go quickly we're going to the
so you find you find a hardware store
and you buy
um you know you buy some the guy now
buying concrete you know you're gonna
need to either mix it or have someone
mix it you know
yeah well i mean if it's a small amount
all we need is like uh
like a shovel a bucket we're gonna need
gravel we're gonna need the concrete and
we're gonna need some sort of uh
something to hold it together and i'm
hoping they have something like a
chicken fencing
that we can use to rabbit that is the
voice of experience right there
yeah well if she starts asking for lie
no not for this um
i i really like it kind of looked like
you were haunted tom as your door like
the screen door behind you opened and
then closed
i saw that all right so
uh yeah you can you know you can buy
all that stuff and then
make cement in the bathtub of your hotel
room
well i mean not literally we'll use
we'll use the the bucket that we bought
for action but of course we're doing
the buckets gonna be in the bathtub
because we're not you know barbarians
i mean you've already you've already
lost your deposit on this room
yeah yeah
so you and so you're just gonna like
put the are you gonna put the um
the shoebox in the bucket and then fill
the bucket with the concrete what is the
no we're gonna have to so the tricky
part is we're going to have to
somehow set up the chicken wire so that
we can drop
the chicken wire onto the uh
the chicken fencing and then start
wrapping that around it
and then cut that put that in the shoe
box
and then pour the concrete and the
aggregate and the the fencing will
hold the dagger in the middle and it'll
give it the structure that it needs so
it can't just like break apart easily
ah all of those were words that i
recognized no no no no
you you there's no way we're going to be
able to pick up the knife and wrap it in
wire
there's no way yeah there we go if if
it's uh
pick it up with a poker or or or the
fireplace tongs
like we could we could take two chairs
put something heavy on each side of it
then cut the chicken wire along so if
it's rolled out
so it can wrap around and then we
fold up the edge and we can like twist
that off and then we can place that in
the shoe box i did
not agree i did not expect to get an
education on concrete today
yeah no no no no well you got accents
and concrete yeah
but sorry this is stuff that dr
hollister wouldn't actually know but
it's stuff i know really well and
this obvious this is if you're gonna put
a cursed dagger in concrete
this is how you do it yeah okay
alexandria is going to be
in the room that is the farthest away
from this thing because
she her her entire arm from the shoulder
blade on down
is sore from the fight to keep it still
yeah i was saying
he can barely move it and then cover it
in concrete and call it a day
i mean phase phase one is is the shoe
box um
i think that should be sufficient for it
being dropped off but like we need to
i mean it's gonna take
i probably want two days for it to cure
but like we can we can wait
one and and take it down tomorrow and
see if they're ready to actually
transport this in like like some sort of
big case that can be locked or something
like that
but by the way okay
this much concrete is gonna be heavy
yeah yeah
yeah oh this is it's like a cinder block
yeah right
we can get a baggage cart well no i mean
a cinderblock
it'd be painful and it'll leave i
don't know if you've carried anything
heavy in a case like you'll have all the
the bruising and the broken capillaries
along there
but it's like you know i am actually
significantly stronger than alexandria
is
apparently i carry a lot of heavy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
yeah like i i'll be able to carry it
sure why don't why don't we just leave
it in the bucket in a big
chunk then you carry the bucket right
it's easier to break it that way
i don't know if it's a whole bucket look
i'm not doing a bucket full of concrete
that sounds horrible
i can't i can't carry a bucket full of
concrete
you wouldn't do that so no just a shoe
box full of concrete just a big old
cinder block i can i can manage that and
all right
should be secure john how how how about
we leave the boys to deal with
this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah
yeah no that's good they can deal with
that
i'll i'll i'll order a luncheon while
they're working on that
yep yep yep we're just gonna
um so you're essentially going to spend
a day
and a half building this thing in your
hotel room
yeah and and when hollister is not busy
with that i'm going to have him look at
my hand again to be like
hi how's it doing help
this is kind of my livelihood i'd like
this to be in a decent place
yeah do you want me to make a another
roll for that
yeah sure you can you with uh
everything's
all right come on nick you can make it
come on back buddy
come on well the the joys of of
internet in a fire zone
although nick is not in a fire zone
probably everybody's watching netflix
and that's why it's
like yes the joys of internet in a
quarantine zone
yeah so he looks so lifelike
we'll see if if nick makes it back um
but so as i understand it you are
gonna
basically spend a day and a half putting
this thing together
that's no problem nick will
successfully do a dr hollister will do
he'll give you three hit points back
because he actually does first aid for
once
um it's beneath him but he doesn't ma
and there are we
we officially lost nick i'm sure he'll
reconnect a little bit
we'll get him back in a second sorry
thomas with the overlays
yeah so yeah she's she's she's still
definitely very careful with that hand
and arm but she's able to start doing
more stuff
yeah okay and donal
make me a power roller
all right i failed that yay here let's
inspire that troll let's inspire that
wire
if we've got some left we've got it we
have eight okay
yeah all right roll it again yeah i got
an 81 on that second roll
oh did you just say me that that's gonna
be a failure in my part
so did you aim it was it worse than the
first one eighty-five to eighty-one so
yeah was okay well at least it wasn't an
amy yeah so
you was almost a nick but you
uh you know you are
you actually have to leave the room as
hollister is working on the knife thing
because you start to feel the urge
uh i'm out i'm out i'm out to grab that
knife
all right all right so
hollister is in there doing that that's
no problem
um and that is unless anybody wants
to do anything that's going to be the
whole the day of the 19th
got it yeah i i think i think we
basically stay in and
eat and deal with with this thing and i
don't know maybe
maybe talk maybe talk for a bit but
that's
yeah talk about dreams and
yeah yeah yeah i i i imagine that while
the guys were out at the hardware store
joan and i would have
talked a little bit about that yes yes
talked about yeah no it's it
i i'm gonna feel no matter what i'm
gonna feel
bad about this for a while and the guys
aren't really listening to me and that's
starting to piss me off and i know it's
not their fault
right back now are you guys doing it no
no we're we're we're this is part of our
talking
previously all right we got nick back
hey hop
in there there we go what'd i miss
um not much oh not much donald bugged up
because it was starting to take
control he got he got out yeah so
uh so you are basically that they spend
the day of the 19th you get that all set
up donald leaves
as he's like starting to stare at the
knife you
seem to be fine with it yeah you get
that set up
now it's just a point of its setting so
um
that takes care of the 19th so it is now
the morning of the 20th
but does anyone want to talk my my
office is open
now that finished my work and i'm all
cleaned up
honestly as as soon as he says that
alexander's like hi
can we chat all right absolutely
make a make a psychotherapy role dr
hollister
i i wasn't going to ask but if you're
offering
oh yeah everyone everyone is welcome
yeah
i'll talk to the doctor well so that'll
be
basically one a day unless you know
unless you've got something like we're
in a boat
because he is like he's coming out of
the bath
bathroom where he has made the concrete
thing doesn't just like wash concrete
dust off his hands
right yeah what'd you get nick oh uh
just a regular success
you you moved the little box move so
now you're behind my camera
stop hiding nick god what do you have to
hide uh
all right do we just for do i just want
to
we want to talk anyways like have a
chat with donald just to
kind of have progress i i think that
that you know if there's stuff you guys
wanna jones got a few things
anything you want to get off your chest
which of us who are you asking that yeah
oh i'm asking it openly but uh
hey that was delightfully non-specific
for your conversation you'll get back
one sanity
um the evening newspaper
reports that a mummy
and a terracotta warrior robbed a bank
you know i i almost wish they were
working for us
sometimes this is
do you think scarabity did that no
you think they just decided to do a bank
how would he be able to do that though
how could he control them
he's a magical beetle creature
he's magic he's made of magic you don't
put anything past
that doesn't mean that he can control a
magic that is from
jones said they were staves right like
what we saw in
egypt they're they're being used for
for crime now i'm just going to assume
that
yeah why would they think of doing that
a mummy in a in a
terracotta warrior it depends on how
intelligent whatever the purple mist is
we need to get superhero costumes on and
we need to go stop their bank robberies
yeah i i mean i i appreciate what you've
done with my hand that wasn't that you
missed nick you did a very successful
medicine check and giving back some hp
thank you well for a shade check
is it possible there's some other relic
that controls these fellows
you know like you know like a golden
mask for instance
it sounds like a job for someone who has
library use
well the thing is is that that golden
mask obviously
didn't because those things came after
the guy but if they're doing something
like robbing a bank
maybe bestie
has taken control of them with the mask
now now they're doing something that's
just beyond blowing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up
you could have given away the thing that
i okay
we are not giving away something that
would cause ancient rome
to come into this city thank you that
might be good to do the research that
you do you know where you look at what
these things mean in the history or
whatever
the library yeah
more library make me an intelligence
role
joan
that's hard so um
you recall that the guy in the hallway
you knocked the mask off of him before
and you took the mask before anything
happened
yeah but then
you never put the mask on no no i didn't
maybe they figured out that you can't
live in the society without money
which this terracotta warriors
how do i get things which i mean raises
the question of their
it raises the question of their
intelligence but that's not in the
conversation i'm willing to have right
now no i mean
no i i just because the way that the guy
acted who had the the
the the mask on i didn't think that
he could control them the way he
he was saying he was saying oh you know
you let them loose
well why would the detective guy have
them
rob himself detective go see what he's
doing have a comment
with him why would the detective who
tried to shake you down
oh that's different the corrupt
detective why would the corrupt
detective rob a bank and the answer is
for the money
inside well and also why why why does
the firefighter set fires
sometimes you just want to see the thing
why does the firefighter start fire you
anyhow joan do you want to have a
conversation with that detective cut out
tomorrow
yeah i think that would be a good idea
what do we want to talk to
what do we want to talk to him about
sorry i
will tell him that we noticed that there
was that they were
robbing banks and what was he going to
do about it basically
the greatest yeah do we
do we really want to approach it from
that
angle yeah i think that back actually i
think we have that conversation's going
to cause more trouble
if he thinks that we know his secret
that we're in trouble
if he's doing this corrupt business
let's leave him alone he's our friend
now maybe he'll give us some of the
money right he's not our friend
and and if he is controlling
a terracotta warrior and a mummy
he would be an excellent ally against
garavetti
which would be which would be
competition to him
yes i wonder i wonder what he thinks of
scaravetti
yes if he's the greatest detective in
italy with the mafia boss right under
his nose
now that's the discussion i'd like to
have with him yeah
i can see how that would work in yes
okay
we need we need that bloody capstone
back a couple of you have had many
dealings with the police
anyone who calls themselves the greatest
detective in italy
is probably an incredibly crappy
detective oh yeah
yeah but here's the thing if he if he
has that reputation that he's trying to
propagate
then using him against the mob boss is
is is a reasonable lever hold yep
uh so it is now the morning of the
20th
all right 20th or 21st 20th
right yeah you spent the whole 20th uh
uh doing psychotherapy and concrete
which by the way
maybe that should be the episode
concrete psychotherapy
the night of the 20th uh
about 10 o'clock at night there's a
knock on the door
i'm immediately up with with my hand on
a dagger just i
got it i'll go look at the people and
see what it is there's a
um there are uh
three gentlemen one of them is uh
uh jim carmichael again
uh at the door
uh carmichael looks very uncomfortable
the other two
look very um
bored remind me carmichael was which one
was the embassy attached the guy who
came yeah
to pick up the item uh
doctor is that ready is the item rating
i mean it could uh
how long has it been set for it's
been set for about
almost 24 hours it should be good let's
see what they have to transport it in
all right so i'll open the door and just
wave them in
uh carmichael like looks around and
um sorry to bother you so late
uh we just
about an hour ago we got a cable from uh
a secure cable from washington
uh your colonel rogers sent us
uh that he he well he he asked
me to give you this
and it's it's a
a cable that says uh
um you know uh
how whatever this artifact is uh
needs to be in one of our vaults uh
release it to the state department
they will they they will ship it to
america
and what's all this i hear about a mummy
and a terracotta warrior
oh god all right oh come on come on in
fellas come on now
um is there some semi out of game but is
there a
like a a code word that would be
attached to a telegram like this
to tell department yeah this is a
state department
eyes only you know this is not this is
not a telegram this is a diplomatic
article i am really suspicious of things
being intercepted it keeps happening
good call good call do
you gentlemen have anything secure to
transport it in
uh one of the guys goes um
i brought a bag oh no
it should it could be relatively safe if
it's sealed up in the concrete
carmichael i just want to reiterate i
don't know
anything about what this is is it heavy
yeah and i come back with a block of
concrete
uh wow okay
um that that's the thing is it's not
dangerous is it if if it's broken open
yes
no treat it with care treat it as if
it's very fragile
actually i so i'm thinking i should
bring it do you have anything at the
embassy to put this in that is secure
some sort of uh
container someone might have the impulse
that they cannot fight to smash this
open
um i you're worried about someone
robbing the american embassy
yeah no i'm worried about while
transporting if i give it to you that
one of you will try to break this open
why you don't need to know finally just
we need to put it in
inside another box a locked box and
then make a larger locked box
we have a safe at the at the embassy is
it going to be transported within the
safe
no the safe is bolted okay we need some
space that can move that's not how what
do we have something safe that we can
transport it in
uh i got a bag no no
we need a lockable box we can put it
we can get a a foot locker or something
we can get a locker that we can put it
in for the
for the sea voyage something to put as
many layers between what's in there and
the people on the outside
as possible and we're gonna need
something soft to buffer it so it can't
possibly
uh crack or break open on the voyage
he's becoming a like poor carmichael is
becoming more and more worried
the whole as you're essentially you know
telling telling him he's carrying a
nuclear bomb
i mean it's not wrong though
it's a little worse than a nuclear bomb
but we wouldn't know that because they
don't exist
yet and so um
he will happily accept dr hollister
if you will
they have a car downstairs if you
want to carry that thing into the
embassy he is a hundred percent okay
with that
yeah i'm gonna go with them and make
sure that this is properly handled
do you want somebody to go with you by
yourself
if anyone wants to come with me it
would be appreciated i don't want to get
near that thing i'm sorry doctor
i will go okay no one goes all right
um thank you so yeah you two
are you know you have a
a lovely car trip it's by the time
it's all set up and everything it's
about 11 o'clock at night
so you drive through the dark streets of
rome to the
um the the very large it's almost
like a manor house the
the us embassy in italy uh
in rome and carmichael
uh will take you into the embassy he
flashes his badge several times
and brings you back into uh
the back office area and
uh i i guess until we get the the foot
yes absolutely it should be at all times
somewhere where it's locked up
all right you'll excuse me the only
way that we can open that safe
is with a key that the ambassador has so
i need to make a phone call
okay and
um he explains that you're gonna have to
wait a little while the inve he just
woke the ambassador up
um but he's like yeah the only way to
get in there
is with a key that the ambassador has uh
and and
uh he'll you know they'll there's coffee
and pastry and you know
like they they they take care of you but
you're there until probably about two in
the morning
before you want to try to call rogers or
anything let them know that
we finally got it here you
send a secure cable from here okay
uh i mean we will mention that i'll
probably
mention dissatisfaction with the
level of
security that's being used for this
and i want to follow up on his question
about the
uh the mummy and the terracotta warrior
and mentioned that they appear to have
taken to robbing a bank
we are going to be investigating them
further
all right so while that happens back
at the hotel uh
alexander and donald it's you know
around and
it's it's late both of you make listen
roles
you know and donald's distracted so he
doesn't hear anything all right donald
is donald is fast asleep
uh alexandra you would swear that you
heard the outside door to your
okay i'm up and moving and like tapping
donald and being like
up you each have your own room in
this foyer
so there's like a a a hall that is kind
of yours and then you each have your own
i mean
unless of course there's you know we've
just learned something about alexander
and donald that
you know well after our chat fans are
very happy
broke in wouldn't be surprised if we
justified yeah uh-huh
that's a good reason all right so yeah
you get enough reason uh
alexandra taps donald who's tired for
some reason
and he uh
you're you're awake and
she says she heard something outside a
mob of
yeah i'm i'm already moving with with a
dagger in my good hand
um and like use the fingers of the two
fingers of my of my bad hand to like
open the door very slightly and peek
through
and so he's he arms himself quickly and
then it's very quiet at the door
yeah yeah so alexandra gets the door
first
um and uh
uh you look out the door and um
it looks like there are two men that are
um trying to be very quiet searching
the area searching the the hall okay
um do they look like
what nationality do they look like they
belong to it's dark
it being dark i want to like
very quietly slip push push the door
open and come
and come up behind them with with a
all right all right yeah you are the
knight
yeah just just like like reach back and
ta and tap donald's like tell him
to be like i'm moving slip slip
slip through the door and come come up
behind them and
i mean knife one of them in the back
he's
he's readying a firearm so if it turns
to combat he'll have a quick reaction
uh it has turned to combat because she
just stabbed somebody in the back
all right you will you know
you're not just to be clear you are
do you do the hand over the mouth knife
into the kidney sure
yeah i'll i'll i'll do that i'm not
particularly tall but i will like go up
on under the balls of my feet and like
grab a guy and hold
uh one of my stiletto daggers the point
of it at his throat and be like and say
and ask an italian
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing in my room
all right so you aren't stabbing him no
i'm not stabbing
yeah told me you were stabbing someone
and i i just wanted to if
that yeah no i i i thought i was going
to and then i reconsidered
all right donald rushes out of the room
once she does that with the gun point of
these two fellows there's a whole
you know quick show of force gun out
she's got the other one um
so you she grabs one guy puts a knife
to his throat
um and you
come out with your rifle and standing in
front of you
uh is a
a very weird um
kind of broken uh
what did you do to me and that's where
we're gonna end
okay so that's gonna do it
