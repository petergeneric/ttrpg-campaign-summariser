you find yourself
in this truck and
uh there are i i mean you see at
least
a half dozen crowding around the back of
the truck of these little dudes
and they are all saying the same thing
in a weird
sing-songy chorusy kind of way
sounds like i'll eat you yeah i'll eat
you i'mma eat you
there you go they are not like
they're not like you guys opened the
flap they are not trying to do anything
else
who someone was going to show them one
of the
artifacts to see if they would chill if
they saw it yeah i think i think joan
was like silly sticking her arm out
i i was had my crowbar
and this i was going to click oh look at
that we've got an hourglass
slide did did slide the toe make that no
he didn't make this one i've had this
one but it looked like it was uh
we're trying to figure out we should we
could make one that was exactly to the
specifications
oh well of my made-up specifications
but that so that's what i was going to
do is is is because i i actually want to
try to get to the cab and
see if i could help our buddy so you're
going to try and get okay so you're
gonna climb over the
the the jeep basically not get down
so you're gonna like climb up the back
of the truck over the roof
and down to the engine that's what i was
gonna try to do
um it's gonna be hard with a crowbar and
a hourglass
because you're essentially doing a
pull-up well first i had to show them
and did did that help at all all right
so you you rip the thing open
and you look out on these little guys
and they're just kind of standing there
and you see like their teeth are
serrated their teeth are super sharp
and their nails where the you know
there's like
their nails are super dirty but they're
very sharp
all right and that nothing happens when
i i show them they don't react to that
at all
okay i did want to i did want to try
to help our buddy
all right so you're going to try and
climb over all right
um
so i'll make you an offer you can
make a climb roll and just get up
and and make it all the way over or you
can do a
strength roll to just pull yourself up
and if you fail the climb roll worse
things will happen to you than the
strength roll
all right i'll i will do a strength roll
okay
because i just want to get up at the
first thing yeah sure sure so try me a
51 out of 55. i got it all right
so yeah you pull yourself up they are
not like scrabbling at your boots or
anything like that
okay they come their heads come up to
about
the bottom of the truck they're about
maybe two and a half three feet tall
so i'm way above them at this point yeah
now you are up
on the v you're up on the fabric top of
the truck and you're making your way
um and you see creighton uh
has been pulled out of the truck uh
and he is surrounded by these little
guys uh
and he's just sort of standing there
like not sure what's going on
nobody's touched him yet i mean they
haven't
no they're not trying to eat him that's
good
all right so you are on top of the
roof uh
uh let's let's see here donald what are
you doing
i've got a sawed-off shotgun i'm seeing
doctor no doctor
i pull out the revolver no put the
bloody revolver away man
take something a little stronger i'm
gonna take something i know how to use
you'll get six shots and then eat your
and how many shots are you going to get
on that shotgun no i've got another one
this has eight shots the revolver does
what you
should 22 what is that oh it's a 38 38
with eight i've
never seen all right i'm impressed with
fine
all right so i thought i got one shot
yeah you've got the second shotgun ready
to go and the first one
is wielded i mean the problem is
you're just like right now everybody's
crowded around the door so you need to
like i mean it wouldn't be that hard for
everybody to get you just have to get
everybody out of the way
so you are well and truly armed waiting
waiting
alexandra what are you doing if i'm
close enough i
i want to take a stab before backing out
of the way so that donald can shoot
so you're just going to go ahead and
stab one of these things sure you know
okay
oh no alex yeah i was just saying
let me know if i do a per well where am
i in the front i'm in the front seat
right
uh no you're in the back only creighton
and his dog were in the
in the cab you guys were all in the back
of the truck i see where we fall in the
uh
i mean you said you were gonna stab so
yes i did
do they appear to be like threatening
are they about to
like jump in and chew our faces off does
it seem like they
for for all the world it's like
um three-foot toddlers
dark-skinned toddlers chanting my to my
two
with incredibly sharp teeth and nails
but they're does it look like they're
trying to climb in i guess
i have a nasty feeling that nidacres can
translate
only if i'm in control i feel like
you you can almost certainly translate
with ears without needing to be in full
control
yeah no yeah i'm just gonna
back up and get a little further out of
the way so that if they if they start
attacking donald can
go at him with a shotgun all right uh
emma
okay so go ahead i am going to
um my e2 let's see how so that sounds
very much like latin
perhaps well i mean to me it sounds like
latin because it's like something and
and you to emma it does not sound like
latin
okay
um your latin is good enough that i'll
it's clearly german yeah definitely
especially when they spit at the same
time to talk um
i'm gonna put my foot over the edge and
see what happens like swing i'm assuming
it's one of those trucks where you have
to kind of swing over the edge so i'm
gonna hang my foot
down and see it's gonna be for it
oh boy we're going fishing this this
episode titled
fishing
well you know you're the best bait of
all so
yeah you hang your leg over and they
kind of
um there's this unsettling sort of
ooh is they like kind of they're like
rubbing your foot and going
to they're not like trying to pull you
down or anything
now they're really saying i might eat
you yeah i'm fine
i'm gonna swing my other foot down and
drop to the ground
oh boy all right um
they will start to try to carry like
two of them are trying to like carry you
or like trying to pick you up
okay so i'm just gonna like put my arms
out so that they can like know that it's
not
terrible and i'm gonna just try and like
where are they trying to carry me to
like which direction
uh they're well so far they're just
trying to pick you up
okay so i'm just gonna start to walk and
see if they
like direction me well no they don't
want you to walk they are picking you up
all right
so you um
i was like here's a leg little buddy
here's a leg here's my arm
you you have at it all right so these
two little guys just
pick him up her one arm is around each
shoulder and they
start to noodle you around to where
creighton is
okay you see that like four of them have
creighton picked up he's much less okay
with all this
but he's like not fighting back he's
just sort of worried
uh hollister you have not done anything
yet yeah
are there still some outside the truck
chanting oh yeah
i'm gonna try repeating my youtube my e2
and like
mimicking them and just see how they
respond oh yeah they're
they they're my two
nieto
and they beckon you they look too
friendly
um
i'm gonna think for a little while i'm
not getting out of the truck just yet
i'm concerned joan you from the roof you
see creighton
is like hey what no what are you doing
and creighton has been picked up by four
of them
um his dog has been picked up by one of
them
uh and actually no they don't pick up
the dog the dog is kind of just
following along
uh it's an old hat it's it's just sort
of like
like going along and emma
has been picked up by two of them and
they're coming around the side of the
truck
what i was going to try to do is grab
him and pull him up on the truck
uh i mean you could try to do that i'm
going to try to do it and see what
happens
all right go come here come here
and try to grab the bar to grab on to
yeah yes um
the hook side that'll get him up there
uh let's see
i'm going to call this
i'm gonna call this a strength roll
okay because you're essentially
trying to like lean over and grab him
yeah
47 so just regular so a regular success
all right you are in a little bit of a
tug of war
as you've like you've grabbed the back
of creighton's like
vest is his hunting vest and these four
are kind of walking off with him and
they don't appear to
understand what the resistance is they
just keep moving forward
and creighton's like what ed no what's
going on
as this shirt is like riding into his
neck i'm trying to get you back up on
the truck man
what do you mean sure they're not gonna
notice
you don't gotta yell at them come on
all right is he gonna push is he
gonna do anything is he gonna try to
help
uh he seems fairly he seems fairly
resigned to his fate
uh he's like
uh he's trying to he tries to like
kind of
slide backwards but they are holding on
to him and so there
there's you're in this tug of war so
next round it's going to be a
a it's going to be a
uh a or a resisted strength roll between
you and these things
um they're gonna have a bonus die
because there's four of them
uh i don't wanna check this guy out make
me an intelligence role
26 that is a hard success
all right these things are stronger than
little three foot tall
uh thing things should be should be yeah
i don't know
i don't mean this in this is in no way a
comment on emma and her physique but two
uh all right that's joan alexandra
emma has you just watched emma kind of
bob around
out of your view i mean like how am i
letting her go by
go off somewhere by herself so i'm gonna
scoot forward and just like
go fishing with my foot all right yeah
they like they're like
[Music]
i'm sorry that was adorable it was
minion-esque
they're sort of cute in a you know
jumping on a dead foot way yeah
like what do you think's happening here
are you gonna get carried away as well
it seems fairly likely but if emma's off
somewhere else she's
not letting her go by herself so
drama i yell back i'm being worshiped
like the princess i
that's just cheating for episode title
material
well i suppose where the princess goes
the queen must follow
and i'll just step and step out of the
of the truck all right yeah two of them
will like carry you
and start to like i know size 90 two of
them can carry me
they can these things are you're you're
struck by how strong they are yeah i'm
very surprised because i'm a lot taller
than i used to be
i'm just like interesting
look at the doctor let's see what
happens what
crazy
this is a great dane society
all right grab a couple extra weapons
stash with me
i'm not coming back to this truck very
likely and um
donald crowd surfs out
uh yeah two of like as you come down two
of them will take you and like
you're almost sitting on their shoulders
kind of okay yeah this is weird but all
right
uh your feet almost touch the ground uh
actually
they have to like they have to like
they're they're like fire they're
carrying
uh knight chris alex chris in like a
way that like they're they're cradling
one of her legs and then holding her
like this on each side
so that her legs don't touch the ground
uh because she's quite tall
uh but they will start to like putter
off
and they don't seem to be concerned
that creighton is uh
lagging behind and being held there the
the ones that have you are walking off
and there's still some outside waiting
for me oh yeah there seems to be
all i'll take my time and uh
join professor lam up on the roof all
right
um so you have the same thing you can
either make a strength roll to just like
bull yourself up there and the negative
consequences won't be as bad
or you can make a climb roll and if you
fail worse things will happen
yeah this character doesn't have climb
i'm gonna write the strength check
and i mean for what it's worth i'm
taking my time they don't seem
aggressive
and you know what i'll give you a bonus
die for that okay if you're taking your
time
i will they too well no problem you uh
you who for for perhaps the first time
in dr hollis
history he does like a a full like
pull-up over past his shoulders and like
pull
you pull yourself up no problem you are
now on the roof of the truck
you and you and professor lam up
there uh
so emma you keep there they start to
just
wander off into the into the
uh the velt okay and creighton
so it now now that that holly's here too
can we both grab him and
and if you wish to continue the tug of
war with the uh
the the people then then we can leave
leave the npc alone i think that's never
ends poorly for the
shoot what are we gonna do holly yeah do
you wanna
want me to help let's try one more time
and see what happens
all right so both of you make
strength rolls and i will make a
strength roll
with a bonus die and we'll see what
happens where's my brother
all right so i'm looking for a hard
success here no
two regular successes okay two regular
successes
creighton
um so creighton rolls in 99
and so he slips up a little bit but it's
mainly because of his collar
should we let go he's like waving his
arms yeah
mind my truck and he like they start to
putter off with him
and his dog like shambles along behind
okay let's let's let's turn do we
have the keys to the truck do we have
the keys in the truck
the keys are in the truck yeah all right
uh it's the afternoon so you can see
there's still probably a dozen of these
things
around the truck and uh
if you remember originally they were
lifting the truck up
but they stopped once the truck stopped
um
if the truck starts up again they're
gonna lift it up again
okay i mean maybe they will what are the
trucks going in the direction they want
it to go but
so we're going to try we're going to try
following them that's what we're going
to do right they stopped
you just stop the truck someone can act
as a decoy
wow so they will yeah they will
as soon as the trucks as soon as it
starts up
uh see that's why i shouldn't watch
uh as soon as that happens they will
three of them will just
lift the front of the truck up and so
the wheels of the
the the wheels on the truck go round and
round as they are no longer touching the
ground
accidentally it's a front wheel drive
it's got to be four-wheel this has to be
four-wheel drive change it change it to
four-wheel
yeah no the the wheels in the back
continue to drive but but um
the truck is not making any headway
against these little things oh
but just tell them we're going your way
we're going that way i'm just going to
keep pointing out at the people i'm just
going to pointing i'm just going to do
it
and see what it does one of them just
looks up as you stick your arm out and
over the rumble of the truck you hear
kind of a lo you just hear
my youtube yeah burrata nikto we're
gonna go
uh they they have shown no sign of
understanding anything you say
god didn't even think i'm brought a
nectar all right um
it's almost like that's not swahili
almost
take it what are we gonna do holly i
wanna i don't wanna hurt them but
we need to go with our people i don't
wanna be carried
yeah my only
my only idea
would be for one of us to act as a decoy
and that's a really bad idea
yeah do you have a flare gun
uh 38 yeah you do uh
now i'll make a luck roll and it's in
the back of the truck
i'm going to climb into the back and get
get the fire all right yeah you you you
go back over it's a little weird because
the the
front of the truck is now at about a 30
degree angle
um so you kind of slide down the end and
go in
um but yeah there's there is a
there's a flare gun
uh in there and you notice
uh in the same pack as the flare gun is
just take these with me
all right you don't tell emma you ever
hand grenades such a bad idea uh
and i'll i'll grab some a little bit of
food and water to bring into the front
of the truck while we try and figure out
what the hell we're going to do
you tell me about the grenades is what i
want to know oh yeah oh okay
okay okay so our options are
flare gun five hand grenades
okay i don't want to think about
they're not getting anywhere and they're
getting farther away how fast are they
going
well they're not going very fast i'm not
going very fast but
so i just you can still you can still
see the heads bobbing as they move off
they're okay so i'm gonna even hang out
the window i'm just gonna hang out the
window and go
guys we're gonna follow numa numa um
we're gonna follow no they're not paying
any attention
did you just work in mindy this they
have no nuts
that's different excuse me they have the
they have the
the the grace to not be offended by your
patois
uh but all their they just keep going my
youtube
might eat you might eat you i really
don't want to see what could make these
things
violent and what they would be capable
of
do we just go then we should
just go i mean you could you could try
gunning the truck
and you know just yeah yeah running them
over i don't want to run them over but
but i
okay i am going to start getting the
trigger i'm going to i'm going to lean
on the horn
gun the truck and go just move and just
yell
just give him my best new york hey i'm
driving here you know
uh my jersey so you
you gun the truck and um
one of them like the the two
there are three that were holding up the
front of the truck uh
two of them kind of are supra look a
little surprised and they let go
and and like get out of the way one of
them stays there and just disappears
under the front of the truck
as the truck lurches forward
okay do we have a path in front of us
at all or are they just standing in
front of us
well those were the only ones in front
of you the most impressed are behind you
all right so floor it floor
flooring is not that impressive yeah you
know on
on on this in this territory there
are no roads
yeah but you gotta do it anyway but so
you will you will easily
and you in your rear view mirror you see
these little things like padding after
you
um and you will quickly catch up to the
caravan
of people who are being carried
cooled down
we see one that's the is the one that
was under the truck did it get up or is
it late it looks like he was not running
he's he's getting up yeah okay all right
all right good are we gonna have to
serpentine to keep them
trotting behind us so the real problem
is
if you you might have to because you're
going to get up to the caravan
pretty quickly yeah and uh
once you're at the caravan you're either
going to slow down or you're going to
start
we can chance loops around them as well
we could do large circles
okay so what it so what are how are you
how you're driving circles around the
the loping
uh yeah how fast are they going
because i don't want to
they're not going that fast okay so then
we can we could drive around and
sure and while they're going we'll go up
here and so
they don't these things are dumb but
they're not stupid
right like as soon as they they realize
you're going in a circle they just wait
oh yeah but we had to do it the second
then we switched to figure eights so the
second
circle you make as you come around uh
there is about a dozen of them just
standing there
smiling my youtube my youtube
not stopping but i'm not going to run
them over
those two sentences are at odds turn
turn turn yeah all right so they start
to fan out and they are definitely
trying to grab the truck
they're not leaning on the horn again
and i'll just i'll just
just point forward i'll lean on the horn
and i'll point forward we're going that
way we're going that way
they don't once again they seem not to
understand
but you know they don't the horn
doesn't seem to bother them
it's really annoying you guys
i don't want to run them over holly i
don't want to piss them off just turn
and get some distance
okay all right so are you turning away
from the caravan or towards yes
turn away and go back and then come back
again okay yeah
um they kind of pat after you and follow
you
uh and then when you're coming back
they're you know you have to veer around
them again and so there's this whole
uh cat and mouse thing going on yup
yup
yup make me a drive
can i assist by keeping an eye on where
yeah
sure yeah you you you were evading these
things
uh you were evading these things
admirably they
they have they are not they're not
smart adversaries really
but we're still going in that same
direction even though we have to whack
and buckle
we can we can go we could always if
they've been going in a straight line
this whole time
we can kind of guess where they're going
and maybe we can get there beforehand to
see what
because if they're like a big barbecue
then we should stop them
you don't need to make a navigate roll
they're heading towards the mountain of
the black wind
i was going to ask what direction we
were heading and if their head we're
going towards
the mountain okay let's go we're going
that way anyway
yeah all right i'll get used to getting
getting ahead of them might be a good
idea
geez if we could leave like a rope or
something and pull one of them
oh that that looks like a horrible way
to travel that's all i'm saying
no gosh i wonder what this i'm
you know ah you're you're all season
travelers uh
so you all are starting to realize that
you are being
carried or driven towards the mountain
of the black wind and you will not be
there before night falls
so it will be dark while you are out
here
we might now want to consider hostile
action
there's really rather a lot of them yeah
i
i mean look at they they've only got a
couple of them holding
out i can't hang out the window with the
gun and just pick them off as they're
that might be a horrible idea but i
don't want them
they've got our friends and they do that
they just go
we don't know that yeah we don't know
that
if we if we pull the group that's
following
they'll be not the group carrying them
will be none the wiser
what like a mile away they're not going
to hear gunshots
no they're not responding to the car
horn
i mean i'm throwing it out there oh yeah
yeah yeah all right do it but like
we we have to come up with ideas it's
it's about
uh you're close to the equator uh
and it you know it's
it's summer so it's not you know it's
not gonna get dark until
let's say sevenish but you definitely
at the speed you're traveling you will
not reach the mountain
they they also don't have any food or
water
like by the time they get to the
mountain they're not going to be in a
good state
and we don't you know how emma gets when
she doesn't hydrate
yep which kind of hydration
we have overwhelming odds and i'm just
really worried that if we start
something
i mean i think
us personally if we start something
we'll be able to finish it
it's the others i'm worried about
we i mean with the rate these things
move
yeah when i said we i meant it's a group
not just us
yeah yeah oh god i wish we could we
could get close enough to talk to one of
them
they've been pretty monosyllabic in
terms of their
conversation i think it means with the
cir
get the other group far enough right and
then circle around and have a
quick chat with the rest i mean you
could yeah sure you could probably get
around where you could like shout
yeah yeah and they don't but they don't
know okay but
before you do that we're gonna cut to
the caravan uh
it's not uncomfortable but it's not
comfortable
it's just sort of you know it's the
longest picking back ride you've ever
gotten
at some point i'm gonna have to get off
uh they they do not they're not they
show no they don't show any
um there's no sign of slowing down
there's no sweat
there's no nothing they just keep going
okay
i mean i think we're gonna be fine as
long as we're not dead flash right
mean it seems it seems likely i'm also
just like if
if if night of chris feels like she's in
danger she's going to start yelling at
me or trying to take over
so right now i'm feeling pretty pretty
confident
well they're taking us to somebody or
some place and then we'll see what
happens i think we're fine
wow it looks like they're taking us to
the mountain and we're going there
anyway
so well
not ideal this is going to hurt after a
couple of hours but
this is not that comfortable you do not
want to go to that mountain says
nidachris
you were not going in the not even you
i mean i go in whichever door
is it presents itself to me
is there is there more than one door in
a mountain
i could probably find them if i were in
control yes you probably could
and i could probably understand and
very likely you do understand that the
more that you take control the more that
they stop trusting
i just enjoy that you think they trust
you i
i felt you almost stabbed that child
and then you didn't impulses are one
thing but what makes
what makes a person is what you choose
to do
tell that to tell that to the people on
the train
and what does that say about your
boyfriend
i know about cairo what about cairo
a poor a poor street urchin
who jumped you in the street and was
crawling away bleeding
and was executed oh i know about cairo
so what does that say with your impulses
about your
friend
the porter that you slashed the throat
of
and
my people as with many people
believe that if you're gonna kill
something you should use every part of
it
i used every part of that man to save
all of you
your friend just blew a porter away
because it was easy what was that you
said about
impulse and how that makes you different
hmm
i don't have control over other people
i only have control over myself i could
give you control over other people
no
especially the company you keep and
she's gone
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you arguing with her again you
know
from my headdress days it does nothing
except irritate you
from my headdress days glance over
nothing you just become infuriated
arguing with yourself and sound half
crazy
well the problem the problem with not
arguing back is that she just keeps
talking
it sounds like a bloody headdress just
on and on and on yapping away in my head
i mean i don't know how my parents did
i don't oh like glance sideways over at
donald
on the other hand she has interesting
ideas
like what just some ideas that she
presented
and thinking about them we got nothing
but time here of our little piggyback
ride
oh just things that i'm thinking on i
don't have complete thoughts on them yet
she does i don't i'm sure she can read
your mind
anyway so there's nobody here that's
gonna learn the secrets these little
fellas don't know what the hell we're
saying
no i mean i mean i haven't formulated
the thought enough to have a
conversation about it
now let me know when you got something
like like dip a foot down pushing and
pushing against their hold a bit just to
flick a pebble up and
um watch it bounce ahead of us they
don't react they're just
you know they keep again there's no uh
there's no like sign of tired fatigue
there's no
they're just inexorably
tromping forward slowly but the
definition of slowly but surely
huh you could probably walk faster than
this probably
nada chris referred to them as children
sounds right
they look like it simple they probably
have another character we heard about
earlier that perhaps
creates all of them or whatnot wouldn't
that be meet the parents
i'm sure we will i'm sure we will in
time
all right back to the truck so you guys
in one of your loops you pull around
close enough that you can yell
at the at the caravan
hey we're thinking about killing some of
the ones that are following
well then we might be able to help you
we're we're fine it's a little
uncomfortable we'll be fine no you're
not it's
it's going to take more than a day and
you have no control over where they're
taking you that way
front door apparently yeah
no let's not do that food tell me food
you have no food and water throw me
water i could use it's a little dry out
here it is hot
yes
hmm there was only a way you could put
water into some
containers and i mean you all have
you know you all have canteens and if um
everybody that is on the
uh i mean emma has a flask not a
canteen
um so you you all have you know a little
you have like less than a day's worth of
water or gin or whatever
i mean you don't know what these things
are what they're capable of
no but i know that i am well over six
foot tall and it only takes two of them
to carry me
they are strong and they outnumber us
how how many how many have we seen we
must have we must have seen all of them
at this point
you've seen at least two dozen two dozen
yeah
they they they out number one yeah
should we try killing the ones that are
following us are you worried that
they're going to
turn on you and start eating you yeah
a little bit so if you're gonna try
anything dumb
send me my grenades over please
[Laughter]
i am not throwing your grenades to you
no please don't
because i'm not that good at throwing
put them in a bag
and hand them over to me swing them over
put them in my satchel and swing them
over are we getting close enough where
that's real
does that look realistic no we'll just
say oh no we can't get in the back of
whatever
um yeah and i'll scream out
yeah does that end the conversation when
i'm like my grenade
truck like veers off they go now they're
catching back up
i couldn't hear you oh we're lit what
we're getting
getting pulled off course here we're
outstanding joan just starts joan just
uh all right so night is starting to
fall
um and you are all those of you not
in the truck
are acutely aware because these little
things other than like
constantly chanting under their breath
are basically silent and so you're very
aware
of all of the like wild animal sounds
and things around you
so there are animal sounds right there
are animal sounds yeah
that's good i'm a little less concerned
about the animals honestly with these
guys
i'm gonna take a little nap honestly i'm
right there with her
where i'm just like this is this isn't
the worst place that i've ever slept
it's kind of easy to doze off once the
like you know the pattern keeps going
and that sort of thing yeah
like one terrible 24-hour work days
where you're just like just close my
eyes for a minute and what
all right yeah so donald you see both
emma
and alexander alex chris are both
like nodding off
in their saddles and of course they're
being held up the whole time
yeah oh yeah oh blood all right so i'll
try to get more comfortable
this is the weirdest place i've ever
slept
yeah it is it is it is less
comfortable for a gentleman than it is
our driver is still with us too right
he's still right now yeah
actually creighton is probably the best
off of all of you because he's got four
carrying him
and so he's kind of like he is almost
crowd surfing where he's just sort of
laying back
[Music]
and he like every once while he'll look
back at the truck and be like when he
sees it he's like okay
i wonder i i wonder how much petrol that
has that's what i was going to ask i was
going to
ask about spare cans we were going to
have to after having that conversation
we were gonna have to plan on what we
were doing
yeah all right so yeah you you look down
and of course the fuel gauge is broken
of course in fact the fuel there's not
even a a lot there's not even like the
uh i don't even what do you call
the line there the the meter the meter
yeah whatever that the the little pink
plat the little
orange plastic thing it's not even on
there
um you know that there are there are
cans of
uh there are gas cans on the truck
but you don't know when you're gonna
have to stop and refuel
just get some distance and we'll pour it
until some starts to
come out and then get up and go again
uh do you want to do that before dark
probably we want no we want to do a lot
of stuff before we're dark like we
actually have to figure out what we're
going to do
because do we do we high tail it to the
mountain
and and try and get there what it's like
to see to just scout around
that might be a good idea to see if we
can
they said they were going to the front
door so maybe we should try to
to get there go go farther past them
it's either that or turn around no
because they don't want us to kill the
little gremlin things
yeah yeah i know i know i know
um all right so we're going to move past
them go go
you know the truck
pulls ahead of you and starts to like
get up to you know almost 22 miles an
hour
uh oh yeah and um
creighton's like hey my truck
where no and he like he like looks back
are they stealing my truck no i think
they're going the same the same place we
are
wherever they think we're going i mean
we told them where we're going or at
least where we think we're going
that way and so they
yeah they will start to drive so you're
driving to the mountain of the black
wind
how can they be so nonchalant when they
know that they're being carried towards
a mountain of pure evil
you haven't been around these people
long enough nothing nothing man
yeah it's a little long for an episode
title but that is outstanding
so nonchalant this is this is not even
in the top 10 of the worst things that
has happened
i mean we were going there anyways
yeah as the truck pulls away i'm
definitely like nodding off
you zoom ahead and about
30 minutes after you zoom ahead you like
stop to refuel
yes and we turn the
turn the truck so it's at an angle so
joe you can see
in the very far distance you can see the
little caravan
um you you notice that they are just
about to cross
into and you have already crossed into
um a very clear demarcation in the
terrain
where before as you were coming up it
was kind of felt
and a little bit of grassland and now
this is just like you know this is dead
land
this is you know everything sort
of like vultures like
circling places this is the terrain
has changed drastically
we can't stay long here nope
yeah uh
so yeah you get out and you you fuel
uh and who is getting out of the
truck i figure i'll get out
so that way joan can start driving um
i'm gonna take note of how full it one
of the gas cans feel and
start all right so there are two gas
cans
and they are both pretty much full uh
and you you take two thirds of one
uh to to fill to basically fill up
uh the current gas tank while you're
almost tempted to use not cursed
dice
79 good that transposed in my head so
uh no i failed all right yeah
everything's fine uh
no no no i'm not that
no every no you whistle a merry tune as
no i try not to piss myself
uh you get the you get the can back
in there
back lash to the side and the you take
off again
and in about you're going to get to the
mountain about
do we want to find somewhere further
away
i think that's a very good suggestion
it's it's bad out there yeah i don't
know how much further we have to be able
to see them we're gonna have to take
turns
sleeping okay but we we can't
be like let's just get off to the side
so those little gremlins can't stop us
again
like they're not going that fast and we
know approximately which way they're
going
we should be able to figure there's no
place to hide here it's just
right just yeah it's it there's yeah
there is no place to hide
no it's it's more get distance
so oh man i need to check
let it slide whatever it is
joan you've got the calendar what is the
phase of the moon right now
it's june 21st on june 21st
it was just oh no it's coming moon
21st it's completely dark yes
oh outstanding so i hate this
oh yeah like you once one
without the headlights you can see about
15 feet out from the truck yeah we're
not we have to we have to
you know i'm gonna make i'm gonna get
some distance i'm getting us away from
here and we'll
just come back tomorrow but the but the
sky
is incredible oh yes billion stars
oh pop open the sunroof then nothing can
go wrong with that idea
you could just go lay out on the roof
and you know watch the
until horrible pterodactyl things come
down and grab us
yeah not falling for that one that
hasn't happened in episodes
uh so you guys sit in the cab of the
truck
are you so no no no i'm driving oh
you're going to keep driving
you're going to drive you're getting us
yeah we're we're not camping
dude no so are you going i'm just going
to go pull up to the mountain
no no away from the mountain no we have
this is suicide this is suicide
we may as well go join them if that's
the plan
well if you want to do that you can do
that i'm going to i'm going to get in
the truck and i'm going to get some
distance and i'll come back when it's
light out
but what if they get here in the dark
and go in
we'll we'll we'll know which way they've
gone
we know where they're going no we
we're just gonna they're gonna find us
we're gonna be trapped out here
you know it we have to follow
no it's the same thing they're gonna
find us
we're not gonna be able to move they're
gonna carry us in we're not gonna be
able to help
but if we move away we won't be able to
see them we won't know where they go
in the morning after they've already
gone in the mountain and we have know
which way
they're on you sleep i'll keep driving
and i'll just keep moving
you're gonna drive all night yeah oh
okay i thought you
wanted to go i'm getting some distance
for sure
then once it gets early i'm gonna turn
around and come back but in the night
how far can we see we can't see them
even if we stay here
and with the headlights on you are
readily apparent
yeah so you're gonna drive around
without the headlights
oh now i'm gonna get some distance and
and have the headlights on i'm gonna be
so you just entered the dead zone
um and it seems the dead zone it will
shock you to learn the dead zone seems
to be an almost concentric circle around
the mountain
so you're going to go back out of this
area and then i'm going to
as it gets towards like three or four in
the morning
i'll come back by the time you wake up
all right if you're going to be driving
while i'm asleep let me sleep i'll sleep
in the back
all right i'm just afraid we won't be
able to get back if we don't have enough
um gas petrol well i'll i'll be driving
i'll be cruising at like maybe 10 miles
all right all right i i am i'm wiped
so i i all right i approve this plan so
are you sleeping in the cab or the back
of the truck
which is going to be more comfortable
well the back of the truck will be more
comfortable
um except for the whole climbing in the
dark
hoping that hollister
we're doing this before it's dark out
like this isn't a conversation we have
when it's night this is a conversation
for
as the sun's coming down it's like okay
we need to figure out what we're doing
now
all right well okay in case something
happens i probably should be here in
front so i have to try to
get back here so i'm just going to wrap
up my my
wrap up all my clothes and and i'll tuck
in the corner and i'll i'll top off the
gas
all right it needs any so you guys
started and so you essentially are now
driving around the edge of the dead zone
i think more like an oval away from it
and then i'm gonna
arc back as it gets
a little past midnight okay um
the one benefit of being in the dead
zone is that you haven't seen any
wildlife
uh in the in the non-dead zone there was
definitely wildlife
i'm still more concerned about what's in
the dead zone
there you go and they don't call it a
dead zone for nothing
uh so yeah so
um you all once it gets dark
you can see very faintly off to the
right
the the red brake lights of the truck
seemingly driving away
and creighton is like creighton becomes
really upset
my truck and he starts to struggle
um and uh
uh he will he he'll like
he like starts to go and he wrenches one
of his arms free
and and he goes flash flash get
get to the truck and his little dog like
starts to like
runs off into the into the thing and
creighton will draw a revolver
and and he like
he's wrenched one both arms free and
he's kind of now sitting up
on these guys and he's like let me down
let me down
my truck um
just wait they're gonna come back don't
worry about it and you should call your
dog back because i don't
i think your dog is gonna probably get
eaten out there by something
uh and he he's he's just like
he sees his truck driving away with you
know
most of his most of his worldly
possessions
and you gotta calm down they're gonna
come back for us
they're coming back fennel relax you you
you're all terrifying him with your like
everything's
fine oh man all right yeah he just
critically failed the sanity roll
he will surprisingly adeptly like
lurch out of the graph of these things
and he just runs off after his dog like
after the lights of his
of his thing and the four that were
after him just like
plot off at the four that were carrying
him plot off after him
going my ito my youtube
i hope that dog survives me too poor dog
aren't you come on flash flash is going
to survive
we'll have to see him we'll have to see
if we see him what did you say donald
hear more about the dog i love it yes
the the the dog didn't make a stupid
decision
it looks like that he's being followed
so if we hear the same thing
yeah eventually
right now he's faster than them but
we'll we'll see you know as he gets
tired
yeah they have the endurance
um so you continue on for
uh about an hour
uh and then you very faintly but many of
you are actually all of you are very
familiar with this
the truck you don't hear this but you
guys in the caravan
a pistol a revolver like what he was
carrying right
probably yeah probably yeah but you
hear
you hear some gunshots and then
you hear three gunshots and then you
yeah that's not good for him he had a
lot more bullets than three in that
revolver well
six at least eight bullets has ever
heard of eight bullets in the river
before that's ridiculous
doing for sure i mean god knows what he
was doing before he got here
i mean the size of that the chamber
would be massive
uh the americans do all sorts of strange
things
i've never seen something like that
so at this point it's about probably
two in the morning and the sky is
incredible the
the stars like you don't even recognize
some of the stars you see and not in
a cthulu sense but uh
uh and there is no moon it is
very dark you can just about see each
other
we're a little further north of the
equator a little further south of the
equator here but
yeah lucky way positions are somewhat
similar but yeah
i see all the stars tonight beautiful um
hollister as you're driving make me a
i'm being careful can i get a bonus time
not in the dark uh
okay oh yeah i failed but it wasn't a
critical fumble
all right yeah you i mean so you are
driving very slowly
so that that helps you out and you
are
uh but you do not uh
you do not come across creighton
so you you just keep driving as if
you don't see you don't have any sense
of that happening so you're driving on
about 4 30 in the morning everybody in
the caravan make me a con
roll but where the caravan okay
this is the moment i'm glad to be about
a christmas party
yeah i failed that i'm i'm exhausted i
missed it by
one you could spend luck do it do it
actually my con is like 80. should we
just the two of us just roll again
i think both of you should re-roll yeah
all right why not
listen i don't want you guys at
disadvantage dice
success with it with the reaper 53.
all right so somehow you're both you're
all
still awake you've like dozed on and off
but
as you reach the mountain you are
awake
um it is five in the morning and
the the the
the sky is just starting to get pink
where the sun
is gonna rise and
they bring you to you are at the foot
of the mountain and they will start to
they they start to walk at like
like a 25 to 30 degree angle they start
to walk
up the up the mountain just like padding
up barefoot carrying you
and the four that were the creighton
and the four that were with him are
nowhere to be seen
um the truck is also not
you don't see it well actually there are
you see you see headlights way way way
way way way in the distance
yeah okay i'm craning to look at those
and get in a sense for where they are
relative to us
but we got a flag back there i probably
should have grabbed that
shank a flare gun we brought in the back
one of those crates
so i dropped some garbage out of my
pockets all right
yeah you dropped you you dropped
something and there's
there's no worry of br of birds here
eating breadcrumbs there's
uh they totally ignore everything you do
okay they basically with with with mono
maniacal purpose just keep like
uh all right so at the truck
hollister first light you're gonna start
heading towards the mountain
a little little sooner okay
um yeah i assume i have a watch or
something do you wake me up so i can
take over or
oh yeah hollister make me a con roll
that's not a bad idea the thing is you
said that you wanted to sleep
at this point lamb's gotten probably
four hours of sleep
so you're i'll let oh
all that lamb keeps sleeping okay i also
don't
know uh
how she's been doing after
the time stuff was done to her i know
that wreaked havoc on her
it's true so you at first light
you're gonna start driving back towards
the mountain
so you or that yeah so you about
about five you start to like turn
towards the mountain
first flight is when i hop out and uh
fill the gas again
okay you uh
you turned towards you turned the truck
you were driving away from it you turn
it around
towards it and like as you come around
you see
um like looking up and getting like
headlight eyes
you see one of those little things
over the body of creighton just like
um all right yeah you just run the
thing over
um there there is indeed a a mighty bump
uh
joan you you wake up as there's like a
bump
whoa what happened what happened holly
back to sleep it was a rock
just okay
um we going back now holly are you going
back we're
we're heading back hollister
and lamb make me listen rolls
i do not make my lists and roll all
right everything's fine
no
uh can we get inspiration somebody
should reroll somebody with a good
listen should re-roll
how's how's jones listen
uh 61. yeah you should really do it
all right all right i'll reroll i'll be
wait wait wait
i'm now awake so i'll listen
no all right everything is even finer
was it worse
oh yeah yeah it was worse it was an amy
oh no but it wasn't it was it wasn't a
member
uh yeah so everything's fine all right
so
about an hour later it's just about
sunrise
and you hear the unmistakable sound
of of the
truck like the knock of running out of
fuel
oh yeah it's a good time to now there's
light
um can you take watch and i'll fill it
yes
all right so you
uh you're sitting in the cab like
like
watching and i'm gonna you know do the
lookout and yeah the effect those things
both of you make me a spot hidden roll
i finally made a roll hey check that off
all right regular success nice so you
see
running palmell towards you in
in through the dead land you see
creighton's dog
flash comes to the back of the truck and
starts barking
uh-oh what is it boy
all right you're outside already so go
ahead
just out of the truck can i see the
mountain from where i'm can i see them
walking oh yeah the mountain is right in
front of you and i can see them walking
up
it oh no all right it's far enough away
that and they're small enough that
okay okay you need to be looking in the
nearby actually i am
i'm not gonna look everywhere tell me
your step revolver is out you're still
probably like two to three hours
um so yeah you get out and you go
to you get the fuel thing
and you go where's the dog barking yeah
at the
that's the tailgate of the truck yeah
what is it lassie
yeah are you what you're gonna see
you're gonna go around to the back of
the truck
yeah what is it scooby what do you see
uh the dog is just like growling and
barking and like
looking at the back of the truck yeah
i'm looking in and i've got the revolver
out
um you don't there's there's no there
you don't see anything there
oh you're making me make a dex roll i
am hey guess whose blind spot you're in
now
there it is all right so um
you know what i think we're gonna go to
break
while i think about this
oh man this wonderful turn of of affairs
wow yeah oh my goodness um
so we will be back
just as soon just as soon as uh
well there are six of us as soon as six
people can use six bathrooms







the dog is like growling and
barking
and all this stuff and you you step
around like what is it boy
and all of a sudden a very familiar
little arm reaches out from
under the truck and just puts a iron
grip
on your ankle
yeah do you yell do you say anything do
i know
you might have just saved hollister all
right well holly are you screaming can i
hear you can
can you yeah okay all right i'm gonna uh
well let's see i have got oh yes i do
have that
that one crystal and leave me behind
oh that's good too so
uh yeah so this thing has just a death
grip on your ankle and
we're gonna go into initiatives uh
that's where i'm last
you might not be last these things are
pretty speed is they're
they're they're they're not speedy um
professor lam i believe you're in the
60s so i think you're going first yes
my dex is 65. so i will i'm gonna
jump out of the cabin and go
and see what hollister's yelling about
all right so you will make it around
you you jump out you run around the side
of the truck and you see
a little pygmy um
oh yeah all right so you
you will see a trail
of some sort of liquid that like is
going from where the truck was
for as far back as you can see
um and you also see a tiny little
fist gra grasped hard
around hollister's ankle okay um
the trail of liquid does it look like it
was gasoline oh yeah
shoot all right and i see the little
hand all right what i'm going to do is
the hollister is completely fixated on
this i'm going to stomp on the hand on
on that that's
holding on to hollis right when i try to
shoot i'm not good enough
at shooting to try to shoot that
you step down
and like you hear like you hear like
crunching sounds
yes but the the hand doesn't move
it just stays on there doesn't react at
all it doesn't react to that
that massive blow yeah you like crunch
down and
there's like a footprint in the arm now
it doesn't move it doesn't do anything
what do you think i'm trying to do i'm
going to i'm
i'm what so what happens i'm going to
try to pull holly just because i
crunch the arm maybe we can pull him out
all right you are in another tug of war
hollister
is gonna move away although i'm
panicking
and i've got my gun pointed at it i'm
having a good run
i got a zero three this time which is
which is
you pull him
and you start to pull this little pygmy
out like it's not letting go of his leg
but it is now being dragged out from the
body it is covered in gasoline

no it is it has got it's it's like it's
it's it's still holding on and it's like
we need to set on fire what else do we
have for fire
you you certainly have matches on you
okay sweet
i'm gonna set it on fire well can i
shoot at it first
uh yeah you you yeah so she is
pulling
you she's dragging out and you see this
thing you now see this little
like it's looking up at you with the
same pointy tooth smile just saying my
youtube
um and it's about halfway out from under
the truck
and this thing is just not moving
like it's it's very they're very
basically i'm putting my gun closer and
closer towards its open mouth
and i'm just seeing how it's responding
um
it's not it's it's still looking up at
you and it's it's gonna it's like
it's gonna try and pull itself up so it
can pick you up
but it's not like reacting to the gun at
all wow
uh let me yeah let me i'm gonna say
since you're since you're pondering this
as opposed to just acting
uh yeah all right it's covered in
gasoline and there's a trail of gasoline
going under the truck
yeah but gasoline needs a spark like
say a firing mechanism from the gun
like that's too if you miss
it like gets off the ground or something
sure if there's
like pieces of phones or something on
the ground
like shooting into the dirt is not going
to make a spark
sure unless somehow these things are
made out of metal then i'm hosed
sure can we get it away from the truck
maybe holly come on let's let's just
keep pulling it it's
help pull we'll we'll pull it away and
then i'll put one in his mouth
all right yeah you drag it about 10 feet
away from the truck you're
you're and you will you can just line up
easily
and fire the shot well three i'm gonna
i'm gonna do the full three
all right yeah i'm not gonna trust that
uh okay yeah the first shot you see
the dog like
scared and it jumps into the back of the
truck
uh and it's like cowering in the back of
the truck um
by the third shot you have turned this
thing's face
into just goo
it's hand like after the third shot it's
hand let's go
and it's like sort of twitching and it's
like it looks like where its mouth used
to be it's trying to like open its mouth
and say something
but we know what it's trying to say
it's okay
but oh oh we don't have no we don't have
to
no not that kind of torch all right
you're pretty sure that that
one that you ran over just sort of went
yeah i'm not gonna say that out loud um
i'm gonna
yeah get the torch and look under the
truck and see what kind of damage it's
done
um but the gas the gas tank has been
do we have chewing gum or anything it's
it's been clawed all the way down or
just punctured or
no no it it was slowly sliding down as
it was being as it was
as you were driving and it was being
so the gas tank has been like you know
ribboned
ah so we shoot shoot i wonder how long
it's been there we were driving for a
wow it must have been behind that rock
since that rock
that makes sense that's why i didn't see
it it was behind it okay
so now with that out of the way do we
have anything
at all that i can think of for repairing
this
uh you you can go through your stuff
uh make me a luck roll as you search
what what kind of success did you get uh
would have been a regular so you needed
a you you
you think you can do like spot repairs
but it's not gonna you're
like you're gonna be you're gonna be
wasting a lot of gas
to look to fix the truck
so neither of you well i'm gonna i'm not
gonna assume
does either of you have any mechanical
repair skill
i'm mostly electronic repair
but so this would be this this is just
plugging up a hole this is if we can get
something where the
we have first aid kits right can we use
the the the bandages from them or
anything
um the problem i mean they're they're
semi-absorbent
but you know like i said you're gonna be
wasting a lot of gasoline
i mean when was rubber cement invented
because that might be in the no joke
that might be in the medical kit yeah
yeah in terms of medicine it was not
like i don't i don't think it was in the
20s i mean
i was thinking like duct tape
substitutes and i was thinking oh
bandage
wrapping kind of stuff but yeah i don't
think those are that
yeah well okay the thing is we need
let's why don't we drive the truck far
enough i mean it's already out of it's
out it's out of gas
we can't shoot okay i was gonna say
won't we drive it until it runs out of
gas and then we
hike from there we've got to get back
is there anything in here that we we
need to carry well
at this point one of the gas tanks is
empty we could use that one gap so one
gas can
has a third left in it the other one is
full could we use the gas capacity
can we use the gas can as the gas can
uh
that bypassing the the
the the fuel tank of the truck probably
goes beyond your
yeah yeah no i mean the the best thing
we could do
is carve up like sacrifice one of the
gas cans carve up the sheet metal
and then try to fix it somehow but i
don't know what we have to hold it in
place and prevent leakage
yeah the only thing i could think of was
bandages but they're not that
strong that's that's gonna be massive
wow there's a website called the history
of glue
it's it's great reading i mean hey
actually between everything we have
can i use my chemistry to try and just
you know what make i'll get i'll give
you a chemistry roll
um
given that you don't have
you want inspiration it's only a 30
chance
you know what i'll i'll even make you an
offer i will give you a bonus die on
this role if you cannibalize the hand
grenades
for materials oh yeah we can
yeah absolutely all right so you have a
bonus die on this roll
all of them do you have to does he has
to cannibalize all of them all the hate
yeah
it may shock you to learn that hand
grenades don't have a lot in them so
yeah
i i second that that that reroll
i'm irate when i find this out
oh it will not be brought up please
you've got to be kidding me is it worse
okay at what point is something a
critical
95. all right so there's a bonus die
with a bonus die you got that i rolled
two 90s and a five yes
wow do you know how my dice work that
new dice that is the dice that is the
amiest of amy's that is the amus of
to give you babies birds of paradise
just to make this stop
i was going to say ezra you got to put
that on your list of things right
so there is an uncomfortable moment so
dr hollister
has fought these six hand grenades out
and he's taking them apart
and there's an uncomfortable moment as
very close to the
truck and you know these fuel these pipe
these
puddles of gas he looks up at you and he
says this might explode
and then it doesn't explode but he he
like
he's like but it's either gonna work or
it's gonna explode
and then he realizes there's a third
option and it doesn't explode and it
well we still have our eyebrows let's
just
and your fingers that's my favorite
sentence said today
yes we still got our eyebrows
i'm exhausted by the way i was actually
counting
on you driving the rest of the way back
and getting in a little nap
so it looks like we're in hiking mode
now
i do want to retcon something based on
uh
uh during the break nick explained to me
more of more ex
exactly how they were driving so you
figure you're about a two hour walk
maybe from the mountain
we got some water we got some food we
gotta go we
yeah we'll we'll fill up the bags
and kind of guys truck dang should we
bring a gas tank with us
in case we need i don't know if i don't
want to try and live higher yeah
oh god it's too bad we can't
we don't have any do we don't have
anything with roll with with rolly
things on it we don't have any cases or
no dollies nothing like that nope we're
filling up we're filling up bags and
we're carrying
you could try and attach a sled to flash
but
you should feed flash yeah we'll give
flash some food and water for sure
flash seems to want to stay in the back
i don't want him to be out here by
himself he's got to come back for his
master we got to get him his master back
ah
i don't i
we should get going yeah all right um
i'm gonna i'm gonna do a leash for uh
for flash
he said oh no if something happens if
something happens flash needs to be able
to get away
well he's not going to follow us unless
unless we leash him oh no
he can learn new tricks they didn't they
did they didn't attack it older
dog is literally safer here than with us
anything
is safer here than with us why am i keep
listening to you why do i keep listening
to you i am okay
if i'm wrong you can tell me that i'm
wrong
i'm listening to you holly yeah flash
seems very
content to like curl up in the bed in
the back of the truck
you know he he he quickly you you've
got your you know that you put out a
bowl of food and water
and he he knows where the rest of the
food is so he's just gonna sit in here
and
chow down and sleep he's very happy yeah
well take as much as we can
people stuff you yeah you load
yourselves down
um i will i'll say
if it's anything other than like a basic
piece of equipment
you'll both have a bonus die to the luck
die to see if you have something in
there
because you pack a bunch of stuff flare
guns
i'm sorry i'm i don't didn't quite
follow that do you want us to make a
a dollar so you know how you ask like
do i have this and i say make a luck
roll yeah yeah yeah you guys are packing
stuff up you'll have a bonus die on that
luck roll to perfect
something okay as long as it's you know
pretty standard
there wasn't there wasn't a ton of
exotic stuff you didn't bring a ton of
exotic stuff and
most of the exotic stuff just got uh
ruined in a chemistry experiment
yep yep yep yep well i have i have my my
all right so you guys start hoofing it
to the mountain and we cut
to the mountain where as sunrise as the
sun rises
on this foreboding mountain
uh you've been walking steadily at an
incline for about 30 minutes
and you you start to notice
that it's getting chillier with the uh
as you're
you're getting up in elevation they're
they definitely
uh they don't slow down at when they
start going up the incline and they're
very sure-footed
uh and about 30 minutes from there
um and
at that point let's leave something
behind here this tunnel yeah i've been
um but you're also i mean it's also
like there's not a bunch of cave
openings in this mountain this you know
like they would find they people would
find this pretty quickly if they were
looking for how did they go in the
mountain
you know and so
uh as you come in you feel
rather than hear a voice uh
and each of you feel it and
um you hear a voice say raja
raja what did you bring me raja
and the little guys like they
they seem to speed up and get excited
like
a british accent out here what the hell
uh
mama wants her babies
that's what we thought well that's
horrifying
oh it gets more horrifying of course it
does this is called cthulhu
so you head into this this tunnel
and you start to go down and you're
descending into the mountain
um and it's kind of this spiraled down
and
you see like weird light way way way
down there
uh and you feel like you're now below
the the surface
um and you um
the whole way down you keep it again
you're not hearing this voice
you're feeling it roger
and coming down coming down
um you go down for almost an hour in
this
uh and you you you level off
and in front of you is another
dozen of those little things
and they're just like standing there uh
uh
doing a little like my two minutes or
like as they bring you down um
and you you notice lots of bones
uh sitting around here uh
and bones huh human bones
make me a medical role yeah
you know bones is bones unless you're uh
you know
they're they're it wouldn't be i mean it
would be slightly more
foreboding if they were human bones i
guess but not much um
and you
are you're brought
into this large chamber underground it's
a huge cave
um it is it is dimly lit
so in the middle of this room is a
massive slug
a phosphorescent slug it's about
20 feet long and
sort of the the massive bulbous body
tapers off
and there is the
the bust of a blonde
woman who you recognize as hypatia
masters
ah
so from when you say the bust do you
mean like from the head and to
from about like yeah from about her her
uh
uh maybe just above her waist up
is you know and and it but it's like
almost vestigial like it's
it's it's sort of just she heard her
she's lolling around
on top of this thing and as you come
in and why you make you know the
thing that finally makes you make sanity
rolls for this
right she says hold
on roger i will look at what you brought
me in a second
mommy's having babies and there is a
horrible like
[Music]
noise and three more of those little
things
pop out of her and start going
um alexandra uh-huh does this remind
you of anything do you fee i'm gonna
give you the op
option if if this is too evocative
of the stuff in peru uh
uh i if or
well let me put it this way explain to
me why this is not too evocative of the
stuff in peru
well what this makes me think of is more
like jabba the hutt
than a sleek little mag of swimming
swimming through
through fat mits more jabba instead of
francois
i really too big this is entirely too
nobody clicked out for god's sakes no
one clipped that
someone clipped that i'm begging you all
right cool i made it
you're surprisingly okay with this did
anybody miss it
i didn't all right so if you missed
it
you're gonna lose for sanity yeah she's
a very lucky number
um and if you made it you're gonna lose
one
okay
and so she'll she'll kind of like
there's this
effort to like bring her her torso
to where she can see you and it's sort
of like you know
bending herself over and she says oh
hello
you must be miss hypatia masters where
the hell is roger
that's roger and she points at the
little thing and that's roger she points
at another one
and that's raja and she points she just
and that's raja
and that's roger all right but what
happened to the uh
you're what happened to roger
carlisle oh i don't know
he he got me pregnant and then he left
men huh
but he's coming back i'm sure of it
imwero tells me he'll come back
and then i'll stop having babies
but i love my babies
i literally have no words i'm i'm not
yeah i took a big sandy head here i'm a
little
i put my after i almost threw up in my
mouth i put my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together
are we able to sleep hypatia masters and
introduce myself
love oh wait so you all right you walk
up and and she is
rather high up in the air and so there's
this weird like she lols
all the way down and you start to get
worried that this massive slug is going
to like roll over on you
but it seems like it's kind of wedged
her
her bottom half is wedged in rocks and
so she comes down
and she says nice to meet you
and i do sort of the dainty little nice
to meet you too like you know what i
mean like the queen
sort of like your hand comes away slimy
oh can i tell what the rest of her is
made of
god no it is awful this is not
achievable he is
uh i mean
what kind of question is that for emma
to ask everything's flammable at a
certain point
do i need any lubricant ignition or can
i just light the match and walk the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
away
uh i mean it seems
usually organic stuff is a little harder
to
uh just light straight on fire you're
you're gonna need one
to match okay so your emma who are your
friends
oh this is and donald
we're here to have have tea maybe
have a drink you know what we came to
have a drink and talk about men
what kind of stuff oh man
stop that and like two more pop
out of her do you have control of that
or can you
i i have to keep making babies
well why do you have to keep making them
i mean you look
we are not put on this earth to just
why you can't wait that's not what my
religion
i'm every says dream i'm barefoot and
pregnant
what what what religion is that what
religion did roger talk you into
oh it was there was something about
um rings in the sky
in space i don't know i didn't listen to
a lot of it
i just know that i am here
to keep making roger i love
roger when's the last time roger's been
here
well he's here now there's roger and
there's roger
roger roger carlisle why is he not
fulfilling his husbandry duties here
right now look at all these brats
running around
they're not brats they're good boys look
they brought me you
i told them i was hungry i'm here to
talk some sense into you lady
your life is more than just making
babies
well what else is it we've got some
incredible
world out there oh no i don't go out
there anymore it's dangerous
what do you mean it's dangerous i mean
it's danger look what happened to those
nice people that we
met what happened to the nice people
well there were all those nice tribesmen
that got torn up
that's why i need roger he keeps me safe
from what yeah what what what tore them
up
well the beast
just just one beast right it's just one
i mean it's enough
okay what does it look like what does
the beast look like well
uh the beast is terrible it's
it's really big it stands on top of the
mountain
and it's just got this big tongue coming
out of a huge
mouth at the top of its head
bloody time it doesn't do it how often
does it do that
every day well no the beast only comes
out when romero
imwero calls it oh
but it doesn't bother me if roger goes
instead of me
roger goes where oh to the top of the
mountain
to be sacrificed
[Music]
and how how often does that happen
concept
i'm like if i'm closer i'm kind of like
i've got my hand behind me and i'm just
like
like if you could see me from behind i'm
kind of snapping and like
motioning to alexander to be like and
you know
what this means right i'm just like
you know what are you asking for is is
it a gesture like
like oh opening grasping looking for a
dagger or
go go forth and stab they are different
gestures
you go forth and stab i'm just like it's
the come on come on come on come on come
on
all right so alexandra you take a step
forward
and suddenly you freeze and you hear
knight chris in your head
and you hear her say that
woman can make a new you i
we can be rid of each other
she's the mother i can make her do this
you mean something other than control of
your body back you're getting you're
getting a hell of a lot out of it just
getting your body back
i'm getting the same thing you are out
of it then then we're even on it
we both get the same thing look you know
as well as i do
that sooner or later i'm gonna take over
you felt it you know
i am patient i am eternal
you are not until i take over
so i'm offering you the chance
to get your body back and all you have
to do
is take you and your keystone cops away
from
africa and never come back here
we have a job to do here i will do that
job for you
you'll seal the mountain i'm not an oath
breaker
so you give me your word that you will
seal the mountain
i don't want this mountain kept safe if
i'm to rule
it would be rather difficult to rule
over people who are being torn to pieces
by a beast
i meant darn it i meant to look this up
i have to see what the last egyptian
dynasty was
last egyptian dynasty was it cleopatra's
the ptolemies or no
i mean yeah but i'm looking for i wanted
a number that's in the first universe
all right i will create
the 26th dynasty
the fair on it of nitacris will rule
africa i have seen it you will leave
you will go do whatever you do in
china you will save this world
back
the circumstances make strange
bedfellows don't they
it's hard to rule over a world that gets
destroyed by your husband
or the friends that he brings in
all of this has happened before and all
so we leave africa when so as not to
break an oath you will walk out of this
mountain
i i will
i will give you protection to mombasa
you will get on a boat and you will go
to china
deal
if this if if i want to be clear
if this oath is breaking broken dear
reagan
this oath is broken you won't die
none of you will die i will torture you
forever
you will be far worse off than this
woman
donal emma
we have a way out of this but you're
going to have to trust me
of course i trust you but what's the
deal what's going on
we are going to let knight of chris do
something
okay what and when it's done
the mountain will will get sealed
okay well that sounds good what's the
catch
we leave africa what's the catch
let's go that's the catch i don't want
to be here any more than you do let her
see the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mountain let's go
emma
you basically just got put between a
rock and a hard place there is no
winning not really no
i i i don't get it what's the catch
what's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] catch
here's the deal the universe
i mean just name it whatever whatever it
is
there's a catch here's the thing emma uh
knight of chris
doesn't want to destroy the world she
wants to rule africa
it's awfully hard to do that if the
world is destroyed
africa attached to it she's on our side
then fine
she'll stop it we'll go we got other
how do i say this without her hearing um
is the world it's not a question of is
the world
it's all of the world or none of the
world
you know is it part of the world except
africa is that
what's what's the what the catch what do
we have to do we leave africa
fine i can leave no it's africa is
doomed
africa is doomed to an evil
pharaoh an evil empress if you will
and not only that an immortal rich
you seen what she did to emma world oh
god that would be the best
like amusement park ever with explosions
it would be like an even more dangerous
version of that new jersey uh
70s donald it's like saying to the black
pharaoh
as long as we save the world you can
just have africa and that's fine
uh all right counterpoint how are we
gonna [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] see this mountain the
three of us
what are we going to do seriously what
are we going to do we don't have any
innocent people here with us to do the
chanting we don't have any
sacrifices the three of us cannot
stop this
e2 i mean these are about as innocent as
they come
uh alexandra i note that you haven't
told them yet that you're going to get
your body back
yeah i haven't mentioned that part yeah
um also
uh the other thing that i want to note
is if you'll remember back
old bundari told knightochris that she
would get everything she wanted but at a
price
yeah right all right i have i have two
things that i would
like to point out at this at this point
this is how i get my body back that's
part of the deal
do you remember what our our old
friend said tonight of chris
yeah of course i remember she would get
what she wanted but at a price
self-sacrifice
well i have a feeling that it's not
going to be as easy as she thinks it is
good
this is how you get your body back this
is how i get my body back
emma
my sword's on me right oh yeah okay
it's okay i agree
all right so uh
nidacra says give me control
all right i also take cover just in case
this gets messy
as it's probably going to get pretty
damn messy explosion
so so nidacris will walk up
to to hypatia
and she will start whispering in her ear
and hypatia who can't whisper
uh is like oh well that
uh that's not uh
i could try and um
knightochris pulls out one of the many
knives that are
now on her person at all times and just
jams it into her arm about at the the
interior of her elbow
and slices all the way down her arm
and then just jams it into a
hypatia's mouth and you see like
blood is like bubbling up around
and the the the rot the little rogers
start to like
um start to uh
start to like move towards her at that
point they start to move forward going
and and uh
uh of chris slash alex
looks at you two and says keep them back
fine uh
do we have are they actually gonna are
they charging in would have to do
they're just moving forward slowly all
right
i'll move in there and try to intercede
then okay yeah they
they're kind of confused that you're in
the way they don't
they don't want to hurt you or anything
they're just trying to get around you
i'll tell you
yeah stay back stay back zone defense we
go into zone defense people
uh as long as it's not the prevent
defense um
and hypatia is like as she's
drinking being forced to drink this
stuff
uh she starts to change color and she's
taking on
more and more of a crimson hue
and nidacres starts to chant
horrible awful words um
and you're both glad that your
backs are turned
um because like the light coming from
hypatia like starts to change colors and
there are awful
sounds behind you and um
i'm gonna assume that neither of you is
looking behind you
nope i'm playing defense i keep the
little people away
look back you'll turn into pillars of
salt there's a lot going on i'm like
zone defense zone d zombie and
uh
about about
10 minutes of this you both notice that
the little pygmies start to get more
insistent
and they're starting to like um
they're starting to try and push around
you
uh at this point hollister lamb
you have arrived at the mountain
and you have made your way up and
and you're starting your way down and as
you're making your way
down you see all this garbage yeah
you've
that's taurus
[Laughter]
um you you feel
this voice that's just kind of going
like
no no i don't want no no i don't wanna
no we gotta pick up the pace yes
no we gotta get going somebody's having
a hard time i wonder who that is
um you so you will you will kind of move
down
and you come into a huge chamber that is
full
of about you know let's say
three dozen of the little rogers all
trying to
apparently get to the mo
you know once again adding to the list
you see a you see alexandra
with her hand her arm come
sliced open and like jamming it into the
mouth
of the torso of a woman and the body of
like a 20 foot long
slug like so i'm i'm going to yell at
this point
alexandra do you need help you know well
first you're both going to make sanity
rules yeah well yeah yeah you might be
doing more than that
yeah i've used up all the bad luck on
these dice so i'm pretty sure
that's not how statistics work yeah i
made it
good good good oh joan you're gonna lose
mr
is just so tired sorry say that
you lose one joan all right what did you
get
[Music]
oh god 95 with a 96 that's the only way
you can
do it wow it's so bad that he's locking
up
yeah that's right the internet's like
nope the internet
yeah you know what hollister you are
overtaken
by fatigue and you're just like this is
he sort of
in sludge all the way down like right
into the scene
like you are um
you're sure that this is just a sleep
you know this is like sleep deprivation
and so none of this is real
unfortunately
that actually doesn't happen until the
36 hour mark
i could tell myself that but no this is
this is this is madness inspired
hallucination
not fatigue inspired to me
to hold on or what so you both see
this woman's body that is glowing
in this sickly it's
it it's the color of blood but it's
somehow emanating light
and you see
almost like a snake you see this
lump slowly making its way
down the body of
of the thing hollister what are you
doing can hollister well give
so he rolled given he rolled in 96. yeah
so you should tell me what i can or
can't do at this point well i mean it's
fight
flight or freeze
okay because the thing that he would try
to do
and you lose you lose six sanity by
the way
take that sanity
[Laughter]
it was nice while it lasted wow two
three
four five six that is correct he's
still doing pretty good
uh the thing so the thing he would try
to do would be to
call out to alexandria again to get her
to come back what would be the closest
you think
to that you're trying to get her to stop
yeah because she's chanting right yeah
like it's clear night of chris
is in charge he probably isn't trying to
that's
a good question he'd be desperately
trying to yeah if it's chanting
alexandria doesn't change all right so
you're gonna like you're
you're you're you're now one of the
things that donal
and emma are trying to keep from getting
up there
you're like you're working with the
pygmies essentially trying to get to
uh all right joan yeah
no i i i didn't think of the the whole
night of chris
you know taking over i was thinking i
was asked asking you know alexander if
she needed help or anything because all
i see is somebody munching on her yeah
so alexandra is being eaten by a weird
slug lady apparently
yeah we're we're keeping everyone away
from the city and you see
you see the pygmies are trying to get to
alexandra
and donald and emma are essentially like
pushing them away
and like trying to block them in a very
non-violent way so far
all right so i'm saying donald what is
the heck is going on
it's important they're trying it's
important leave it alone she'll take
care of it
are you i mean are you okay are you okay
fine she's fine
that's great it's gonna seal the
mountain
oh okay so this is the rich ritual to
see on the mountain beautiful
okay all right so i'll help you with
that i'll help you i'll help you all
right so
um so hollister is just like you're all
fools and he's trying to get past
no no hollister mm-hmm
um and the the pygmies are
starting to get more
fervent about what they what they
want to do
um and they start to like uh
the the myitu that they're saying starts
to like get a little
tinge of like anger to it
uh and uh
nighty chris is like not much longer to
hold them back
and we're gonna go into initiatives uh
because the the pygmies now have to stop
this
so and maybe hollister too i don't know
uh
my two my two
[Laughter]
uh all right donald since uh
knight of chris is chanting on her
initiative you are the top initiative so
but um
about the threats to get through was
there one particular one that that's
broken past us not yet not yet
there but so it's mainly numbers right
now
it's just you know there's there's like
36 of them
and dr hollister you're you're aware
that like hollister is trying to like
push past
all right well i want to basically i
have my rifle out
to help to kind of go you know yeah
you're like pushing a little bit you
know
you said just i'll delay an action if
somebody gets past me then i'll try to
melee
actually on when you when you start
using your rifle
um
your choice either a dexterity or a
strength role
opposed versus this thing i'll go dex on
it
all right probably a wise choice but a
single regular success 64.
all right yeah so one of these things
like
slices down with its fingers at your um
at your rifle and you pull the rifle
away but it was like it looks like it
was going to try and cut your rifle in
two
they have definite and that's when you
realize that they are stepping up their
level of aggression
right so yeah for your action
you're like jamming them away with your
rifle this round all right
my crowbar and i'm i'm i saw what they
did but yeah that's a rifle this is a
crowbar so
uh same deal you can make a strength or
a dex roll
next oppose this thing all right oh
birds of paradise
45 i did good but it wasn't hard no i
got an ott9
oh so this thing just like swats your
crowbar out of your hand
and your crowbar goes like flinging to
the other side of the
uh of the chamber and it starts to like
try to get past you
uh 60s 50s uh
i don't know if emma like you what are
are do either of you have lower than 20
no
all right so you're both going before
they do then so i think it's emma then
hollister then
then the the guys
do i have like when i say torch i mean
like i want to make a torch
like a fire truck you want to burn
something you
yeah you you can find the pieces for it
so you're going to start assembling a
torch
yep so i'm going to take a stick wrap
some wire around it and you know what i
mean doing it kind of half-ass where i'm
like kicking one and doing a thing and
elbowing another one
all right yeah if if hollister is nearby
you're gonna notice that he did spread
he has a gas tank
gas can strapped to his yeah he does
also too if hollister is nearby and he
comes past me i'm grabbing him like he's
actually somebody that i would
tangle with without a problem thank you
like that's like the second player
that's like i wouldn't mind taking a
shot at hollister
i'm just saying i'm not gonna grab the
things with the teeth and the nails
hollister on the other hand i'm like
right
i i feel like should have a better shot
against hollister instead of the the
little things with shark teeth
yup can take him all right uh
hollister
oh i am sobbing and pleading with
alexandria
to to stop this madness you're you're
better than this you can fight it
please make me a pal roll with your pal
not
this is an opposed role
oh do you need my pal nope okay 16
hard success
oh my gosh all right well here's what
we're gonna do oh no
i'm gonna start a counter i'm i'm will
i'm i'm given control of tonight to
chris willingly i'm not you sure have
but but hollister's like you know
like seeing hollister begging and
pleading
you momentarily pull out of it and
you're aware
of a really bad pain in your left arm
um and you're also aware that hypatia
masters is sucking blood out of you
for some reason and and
you see like you know hollister like
begging you to stop like cut through
everything that was going on you're also
very aware that nidacres is
pissed all right so
uh i that means this timer will not
decrement this round
uh okay
20s so donald
joan are they smart enough to know that
hollister is
they're they're fine with hollister um
so the the other three of you um
should make me uh
i'll you can either make a dodge roll or
a strength roll your choice
uh but i it's going to be opposed so
uh emma are you doing dodger strength
i'm going to do strength that's better
oh wow ooh ten
birds of paradise giveth birds actually
it's not ten
one because the ten is a one right
or what's the ten on the tent somebody
explained this to me did you just roll a
hundred
no you rolled a 10. yeah the zero yeah
zero from the tens i rolled a zero
yeah you're good and on the ones i
rolled a ten so it's good that's
that's that's ten but he rolled a 99
so it doesn't matter
so this pygmy like comes up to you and
he tries to pick you up
and you just push him away and you knock
like four other pygmies off
um and so next round they will
have a disadvantage die against you
um professor lambs dodge or
strength i'm doing strength okay
0-1 not that much all right so
like you are grappling with one of these
things and
uh you i no longer have my my that's
right you are holding your own
donald dodge or strength i i wrote dodge
and i wrote 97.
oh all right
i'm not alone thank you and that is one
higher than what i did
all right so this is the one who tried
to slice your rifle
so what happens is you in a very donald
moment
you're like save the rifle and you get
sliced
down your down your chest and you
take
you take two points of damage that's
really sad that i rolled a d8 and that's
what happens when you roll not birds of
paradise
i can't find the d8 of my set it's
around here somewhere
um all right so yeah you get sliced
but your rifle is fine okay good that's
good i'm okay
uh and and so
they put like because of
uh alexander all that stuff the timer
doesn't decrement so they push forward a
little bit
like you guys have lost a little ground
um
and uh
yeah all right so top of the line up
donald we're back to you
these things it's clear the gloves are
off now
oh god all right the nearest one
that's getting through i think i want to
just clock in with my rifle
i love it yeah make a fight brawl all
right so that's a
zero eight so that's a much better role
oh god yeah he
he does not dodge so give me a d6
that's a club
that's basically club plus your damage
bonus if you have one and so that would
be the extreme success so it just
should be max damage or no no this
extreme success is double damage
so it's a six plus what's the other day
your damage bonus if you have one
none so okay so roll you you do double
damage so roll a six again
and plus two all right so eight points
of damage
you like crunch this thing right in the
face and there's like a little like
indentation in when it does it it's like
my itsu
and it staggers backwards some and you
you crunch it
good that was 70s
60s professor lamb
you are locked with this thing you're
grappling with one
but grappling with it is like blocking
several of them from getting good
good because i'm trying to do that kind
of and i want to basically i'm going to
use it as a a as a way of blocking the
other ones i'm going to stretch it out
hold its arms
yeah you're you're doing that so go
ahead
uh make a fight brawl roll this will be
a posed fight brawl
no all right can i re-roll back guys
yes yeah i mean you've got the
inspiration so
yeah okay i'm gonna try it again because
yes i just made it okay 59.
uh okay so you yes
you been so it it it got a better or
you got the same success as you see you
guys continue to like struggle back and
forth
do i block any of the other ones with
him though uh
it's yeah it's it doesn't look like it's
made any any progress
emma you've got your torch made so i'm
indiana jones in the asp's
like in that dungeon where i'm just like
meh
man all right so you're you're putting
let's see um
i hope with that much enthusiasm i'm
gonna say
i'm gonna roll a d6 even as they're
afraid of fire odds they're not
okay i rolled a 5. so
they're like you know they're they don't
like that you're poking things at them
but it doesn't seem like they're backing
away in terror or anything
but i'm able to am i able my question is
am i able to keep them
in the circle am i able to maintain my
zone defense
uh somewhat yes if you get too close to
hollister his back might start on fire
but
oops no no not oops
remember what's on his we're not gonna
talk about oops right now
hollister where are my grenades huh
what about a flare gun buddy where's
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] allister's focused on uh
solving to yeah he's trying to commit
that's nick saying you do see that
there's gasoline
on his backpack that his backpack on
fire
okay speaking with hollister make me a
pal roll
so we're we're this one should be a 98
right
i would love that it's the one
all right so now
alexa chris make me a power roll
this is an opposed power roll between
you two and he wrote
a one you might roll a one
i know deep down you're good oh god
i mean i rolled a 25 it's a hard success
but it's not
that not an extreme all right well the
timer
doesn't decrement again as like alex
as as hollister just makes this
impassioned plea
to your you know the evils of magic and
like turning into this
you know what it does to you and so i
got
i got a success when it was detrimental
to the party
just just so that's clear yeah
whoa all right on twenties
uh everybody we're doing should make
me dodge rolls says these things are now
just trying to cut their way through you
dodge okay oh my uh
donald you should make a very good dodge
roll i got 31 but that's a regular
success
all right wow my dodge isn't that bad i
still miss it but that's
um all right all three of you make me a
luck roll let's see who this attack was
against i should have
uh 12. that's a good roll
zero one for money better roll 86.
and i have some bad news for you you're
kidding 86
you get big time sliced here
with a critical success oh
schneikies you take 10 points of damage
holy cow that's half my damage do i
[Laughter]
so this thing just walks up and like
just slices you
but with both hands and yeah that's
that's bad news 10 points damage not not
great
uh all right joan you missed your
dodge roll
six points of damage i'm glad i went
back to the birds of paradise
donald i'm not we're not happy yes in my
dodge oh man
it missed you oh you got a success yeah
it misses you
that makes me sad all right and the
timer
stays where it is and we are back
um you guys get you get pushed
back a little more
and donald you're you being
you know a fighting person this is not
going well
yeah that's how much i could do
in this situation do i have any idea
that i mean you've got a sawed-off
shotgun
oh i i'm gonna do i have any idea that
hollister is talking
and interrupting i have no idea i assume
that that's what's going on really i'm
probably oh i think you're
you're yeah you see holla you've you
you're pretty aware that hollister's
going the wrong way on this one
i figure he's just talking and i don't i
have no idea it's actually working
that's my thing i have no idea his words
have any effect whatsoever he's just
talking he's just being
he's just being dr hollister right sure
you know he's
instead of fighting he's just talking
and doing his nonsense
so that all contracts yeah but you
but you wouldn't know that she's been
going to him for psychotherapy there
might be something there
he's a terrible doctor as far as i'm
concerned he's done nothing for me
so you know he has a flammable case
on his back that's all emma gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
oh i love it i mean it has a cricket
with eight legs that should be pulled
out at the mountain if we're ever in
trouble
all right all right so if this if i
can't
i may have to just yeah i may just go to
donald donald cannon style on these guys
so
that seems appropriate i think he's
gonna be a quick
shove and then back away with just one
step
and pull the sawdust shotgun out and
unleash on these little bastards right
i think that yeah you you you basically
like this thing
it slices you and you just like boot it
in the face
and then draw your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in like in in
one motion draw the shotgun and just
kind of fire
uh mostly away from your friends
unless well depending on how you roll
unless hollister is in front of me yeah
i know
[Laughter]
all right give me a roll holster does
seem to be a buckshot magnet
eighteen eighteen yeah all right so uh
uh
sadly
can i spend one point of luck on that
and get an extreme success
sure yeah
all right so all of a sudden
throughout this thing there is just a
kablam and you see like five of these
things
stagger backwards with what used to be
their midsections
or you know like they're just like
falling and you hear
um you you hear
sorry you feel the voice of hypatia
masters
sort of go like waka oh
uh and yeah you just like blew five of
them away
flaming shotgun shell out the side and
we will the next round
uh that that cleared things up nicely
uh
all right that was that was 70s
60s
is professor lamb are you going to keep
just kind of fighting with this guy
and i am going to yell at dr hollister
and tell him to shut the hell up
we need to have this ritual see i don't
know what ritual it is but we need to
have this ritual done
you need to shut the hell up
okay and i'm gonna try to fling that the
guy i'm holding
at him all right yeah they're
they're surprisingly light so yeah
we'll call this an opposed strength roll
oh my he did not want to get picked up
okay i got a regular success he got a 19
sadly
so so yeah but you um
uh you you uh
all you're yelling and stuff will give
hollister a penalty die
on his power roll this this time okay
uh all right that was 60s emma's
so basically i'm done with dr hollister
and tell him that he needs to be more
like a man like like donald right now
give him my torch hold this please
while i take care of business take his
backpack full of the canister
and just start spraying the masses
with all right so allister weirdly
is not even he doesn't even react when
you pull it
it's kind of like hey honey hold my
drink
world to emasculate he is um
but you will clearly notice that he is
focused on alexandra and like you can
hear him
like you know using you know
using key you know he's using
eye
phrases to and and and that's uh
but but all amazon is like talking
and just
starts pouring gas all over
pygmies sure yeah you have poured gas
over a bunch of pygmies
you know where this is going right i i
think we all
barbecue finally burning down kenya
thank you all right all over
this so all right hollister and
uh alexandra opposed power rules
hollister you have a penalty die on your
power because you're holding a torch and
i'm telling you you're a
not a man regular regular
regular success alexandra 90.
all right the timer once again does not
decrement
it's too high what are the rules on this
what do you want me to read i mean no no
no if she's got a 90.
can she reroll that yeah i'm not
entirely i'm not entirely sure what
we're rolling against at this point
yeah if you are rolling an opposed power
roll
with dr hollister uh-huh and if i
fail i get that night of chris has more
control or
that's right even with sorry you're
trying to beat dr hollister you want to
get success
over dr hollister yeah you got it yes
yes okay the rest of us who aren't
hollister
hollister what did you roll i rolled
a
regular success so you have to beat a
regular success so
um are we both be rolling or no
they're not giving you one well no
because i'm at disadvantage so my
chances of rolling worse
are higher but my chances of not getting
a success are very low
well i wrote a 24 which is a hard
success all right
so that decrements the timer um
and nidacres is in control again and
starts chanting
oh good good good the champion and
she looks down at emma as emma's doing
this
and and and she just smiles
she's she's she's happy to see someone
taking charge in
in the right way all right
that was i mean she's she's emma prime
or was emma prime once upon a
uh all right 20s they go so
um this is gonna be attacks against
emma joan and donald let's start with
emma
um let's see yeah they don't seem to
bother with the
the gas so they will take a slice at you
uh
you you need to make a regular success
on this dodge roll
oh god um
come on birds oh jesus crime any 88
is not a regular success that is not
you've got inspiration
inspire let's use it okay let me trade
these out i need to figure out
we are now down to trading out birds of
paradise for another set of birds
all right all right back up birds you
know
are these the classic birds what are
they your fingers in front of them dear
they're blue with the yellow yes those
are the
the actual birds of paradise the
flagships so i'm training out magpies
for actual birds
here we go oh thank you jesus okay so
that's 43 and actually i have three
inspiration left on my
my physical counter so okay
uh you dodge all right jones same
thing you're going to
take a dodge against an attack here um
your pygmy is apparently distracted by
your efforts to emasculate hollister
so he he misses you well i didn't
i didn't dodge either so right there uh
donald the attack against you right
that's a regular success
so you need to make a dodge roll oh oh
wait i'm good
yeah you are very good all right yeah so
this thing um
one of the ones that you shotgunned like
tries to like
crawl and slice you and you just like
crunch down on it with the yeah you
crunch it down with the butt of the
shotgun and it gets nowhere near you um
all right that is all of the 20s
you feel like you pushed them back a
little bit with all the success
and with that going on
so you have kept the perimeter uh
this round
we're back to the top donal what's the
situation look in front are they still
they're still
there's definitely a little clearing in
front of you because of the the
the massive buckshot but they
more are coming i'll i'll aim another
grouping
with with none of my friends in the way
so
i'll be a little careful this time all
right so hollister's okay
not one of your friends i'm not going to
close enough that emma got the stuff off
of him he won't explode now if you shoot
him
all right make your roll yeah that's a
hundred
that's that that's zero zero zero on my
dollar is that a is that a malfunction
yeah yeah that shotgun's gone yeah
something worse happens it's up to ezra
really um
so it is yeah so you like you you fired
one
you know you you fired one barrel and
you were about to fire the second barrel
and you you hear the telltale sounds of
a jam
um and at the same time as there's a
jam
one of the ones that you thought was
dead suddenly just reaches up and
crushes the barrel of the shotgun
um all right that was 70s uh
professor lamb
i i just got to keep these guys back a
little bit longer
sorry so you're going to do another
fight all right this will be an opposed
fight
oh my god i got this one's uh
what's the second one is hard success
yeah so i got a i rolled a 12 which is a
critical
so picks you up over its head
all right that was emma
time to light it up all right yeah you
you grab the torch back
um and you throw it down and
i'm bad yes my children
uh yeah you start a you start a
um a good fashion barbecue
you yeah you start a a fiery dance of
little people
uh and there are
uh awful smells that are kind of good
uh throughout the thing as they kind of
they they're moving they're still kind
of moving forward but they're definitely
like slowing down they don't seem to
feel pain
but as their skin sloughs off they
seem to notice that
uh but so whoosh like a gasoline fire
erupts
across about half of the chamber
and you once again hear hypatia go
like
water what are you looking oh where are
you going to roger
um all right yeah the um
the the room is this this cave is also
uh and that was that was emma's
hollister make oh so this is
again a posed power roll with you and
alex
it's still good in you i can feel it
fighting i can't i'm going to punch him
seven critical success for me all right
critical success that will decrement the
timer twice
uh yeah you neither chris like
um hollister in in one of
us in a in a sad moment for you like
you're like
like nida chris just looks right at you
and smiles and starts chanting like
louder
he's got you all right so 20 so now
attack
um emma you're not gonna get attacked
this round because they're all on fire
um
joan you're not gonna get attacked this
round well
hmm i think yeah this thing's just gonna
throw you away
wow no it's not so it's just gonna
hold on to you uh
you see it like picks you up and it
starts to try and throw you but you like
you know you like move your center of
gravity and all this stuff and it can't
quite get the
throw on you so you're still just above
it all right
and donald uh
it'll be next round before they can get
before they the ones that are coming
towards you have reached you
um and we're back to you donal
you once again you guys have gained you
guys feel like you you you
you moved the perimeter back of good
ways this round yeah that shut the
shotgun's gone unfortunately but he's
got other weapons
it's true you do see professor lamb
like being held almost effortlessly
above one of their heads
so i'll take my 45 out the holster and
just
nail the one that's holding lamb nice
you get make a pistol roll with a
bonus die
in my short range yeah i'll do a three
shot burst on this guy and just
finish him off all right yeah yeah and
with a bonus die you're just gonna like
this
nice tell me to stay still
it's a 45 but it's a regular success
all right so you you essentially like
this thing
has joan up and you walk up and you kick
it in the back of the knee and just blow
its leg off
and it like flops down and joan flops
down next to it
um but yeah with with three you you
essentially blow its leg off with three
quick shots just blam uh
all right that one is down and that
is
60 so we're to professor lam you can
you can get back up and get back in the
fight this round or you could go get
your
or you could what do you want to do when
i want to get up
and i want to go to hollister and to get
him to shut up
all right what is your plan to get him
to shut up i'm gonna
i'm gonna put my hand over his mouth and
just say we're
we're winning stop this just leave her
alone i'm gonna i'm gonna and i'm gonna
try to
uh i don't have psychoanalysis i have
i got psychology i could do a cult i
could be
what do you want me to do don't see a
cult being very useful here
a cult might be the worst possible
here's why she's chanting you just need
to understand
why she why won't he understand
that's what i'm trying to i was trying
to think of can i explain it to him
that would totally be a professor lamb
thing
let me explain to you why this that this
thing you hate is good
yes yes uh
um gosh oh
offer me a roll all right you want to
try a cult
yeah don't try a cult
i don't if you're trying to like gag him
with your hand maybe fighting brawl
fighting brawl
i guess that's what i've got to do that
all right so
um hollister this isn't a po are you do
you notice her are you so focused on
i'm so focused that's the same thing
with emma like i didn't
realize yeah i might struggle a little
bit when it happens
but yeah all right what'd you get lamb
i got 33. all right is that that's all
right
so yeah you get your hand over his mouth
so this round there will be no
um there will be no power rule it'll
okay that was 60s emma
so i'm just gonna wade into it and just
kick little men and
light them on fire yeah you start to um
you know at this point i think we're
gonna come out of initiatives because
um the timer only has one left so you're
gonna do it so
yeah like you're all pushing forward
joan you just
wrap hollister up and cover his mouth
and he's like no
no you're oh no no come on
and and like only only hollister
sees knight across just looking at him
the whole time
and and she looks at hollister
and she mouths the words watch
this and you hear she she pulls her
arm from hypatia
and and tries to cover the wound but
like it's a bad wound
uh and you hear hypatia going like
um roger calm down roger
stop making all this noise and the the
pygmies stop
they all stop doing what they're doing
um
and hypatia
plops out a a
uh uncomfortably wet and all
uh all surrounded and very naked
alexandra
and knightochris
like niachris snarls and says don't
touch her
and just walks over and yanks uh
like the the body is just lying
there inert
and nidochris walks up yanks the head
back
uh sorry with this hand takes her arm
and just jams it into the mouth of the
body
of alexandra and um
once again the pygmies now are sort of
um
are now just going to hypatia and are
like trying to like
take care of her and they're they're
sort of keeping you away from her but
you're all now moving away
um and nidochris
looks up at you and um
pulls pulls the head back
and says in two hours
[Music]
leave this place and she just like
flings
her the her forward i'll collect her
i'll get it
all right and as you as you
turn as you like start to turn you
see
nida chris like take the blood
and go up to hypatia and run it down her
forehead
and as you're like dre you're dragging
hollister out and someone's care and
donald is carrying alex um
you hear like a jacket or something you
know wrap her up a little
carrier sure knight of chris
puts a little blood on hypatia's
forehead and says
i pull my sword is my sword
ethereal or is my sword real uh
sort of both but yeah you pull out the
sword of Akmala
like it's not pulling out it's like when
you think about it it just appears
so when she's like blah blah and doing
this to hypatia
does she see me behind her no no she's
very focused
well i i go for it i stab that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in
the back you
you come up and you run the sword of
akhmala through
uh through nidacres and her head
immediately snaps around
and she says oathbreaker
i'm not conscious for this i have
nothing no it's like i i thought
i thought we were doing the the the
mountain
is just standing there looking at you
with just a furious
and
let's see what happens so you so um
all right
uh so you're you've got the sword
through her
uh alexandra you are a brainless husk
right now
uh professor lam what are you doing
yeah i let you go but it's like black
bait i thought that's what we were doing
i thought we were trying to cap them out
and i thought this was the whole thing
so yeah lamb is just very confused
hollister you are free now
but i'm still mental ish you're you're
coming out of it
the trauma of all everything that's just
happened is
although you might be happy that night
i don't know i mean alexandria is over
in donald's arms at the moment
maybe we don't know what happened oh
we explained later so hollister is
i guess dumble all stumbled towards
knight a chris
okay all right uh
and donald you're getting out of here
with alex is that i'll
slowly i'm not going to abandon the
party mind you but i'm moving that
direction
okay you go to pick her up and your
hands go right through her
i was holding her already before this
happened yeah but so you
like she slides out of your hands when
the stab happens
and she is now non-corporeal emma she's
not
emma is not working emma it's not
working
i pull the sword back out i'm like oh
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

a you see a a
uh a super precise time
piece that has it has the time in cairo
the time here in kenya and the time in
china all of them like
like counting down at the same time and
under that
there's like a little architects tube
and you just look in that tube and you
see like these are plans for some sort
right or well so in the 1920s
rockets don't really exist but it looks
like it's you know it's like a bomb that
has an
and uh
i'll turn to and maru and say
you have my deepest apologies
and i'll leave looks at you and says you
i take off all right yeah you so
while he's gone

no no that place is terrible let's go to
tokyo
get french flynn friends list friends
to help us out so let's wait for
hollister
all right hollister comes like running
up he's not you know
it's clear that cardio is not his first
priority as he's like huh well it's also
clear he hasn't slept
and he just mental breakdown and now
you're getting to the hallucinatory part
so as he comes running up i'm like
together or shanghai where do you want
does anyone speak chinese or japanese no
well
either of those languages where do you
want to go
crazy crazy gorilla flint where do you
want to go
i'm going to go throw up over here great
we're going to tokyo
yeah don't pay attention he's starting
to really bug me
steps to the left and like throws up
quickly
uh and then you tell the cricket you
want to go to tokyo yep take us to tokyo
all right so i gave her extra
grass
[Laughter]
um the cricket says well
i can't leave africa but i can send you
to tokyo
that will never happen i can't let you
out of this cage
not if you want to go somewhere
no it's okay
so i mean sort of
so do we do we go get the dog and all
the rest of the supplies or anything
like that you're back at the tree you
you made it to the truck that's where
you
let's pack up the things we want to take
with us i'm taking the dog
i let the cricket i open the door so the
cricket like can become a door
all right until you tell it where to
go it doesn't it just stays in the cage
okay are you guys ready go grab a couple
things i think we'll need
we got everything we got the flare gun
you see you your keen your keen
knowledge of demolition
sees the remains of six hand grenades
like yeah and i'm pissed i've got
nothing i'm basically taking my whiskey
bottle and a dog
i've got nothing either my daggers all
got left behind on a crazy queen
they make great tokyo japan country song
emma's got her whiskey bottle at her dog
pretty much i've turned into an old
truck broke down but i got my whiskey
bottle
and we hold fans like harry potter and
i'm like there's no place like tokyo
so the cricket will climb out of the
um we'll climb out of the cage and uh
it will climb up on the truck and then
it starts to unfold and the back of the
truck
becomes a a
a tent flap door and
the little cricket face at the top of it
says
thank you now i am she who
don't worry hollister don't worry just
come with us
i'm in the door i'm just like just he
goes first yes by the way
yes goes first all right so
you you step
through this portal and
uh this is so every other door you've
been through was different
because you went through the door and it
was just
um it was just you know you walked
through into a
it was like you were opening another
door but this time there is a
definite feeling of motion as you kind
of
move through some sort of tunnel
incredibly fast um
if if some of you had been under af
under egypt this is kind of reminiscent
of that but it's just like um
and you end up uh
in the middle of you you you end up like
sort of
popping out in a a park
with signs all around that are in a
language you don't recognize well you
recognize is japanese
and you are all in tokyo
i'm still out man i can't do a thing i'm
gonna lay down
and i'm gonna do that too
[Laughter]
do i see like who's who's the next
person i can
so yeah there's people walking by
i make the motion for the gorilla i'm
like
[Laughter]
um they will give you broken directions
i'm taking it why don't we just find a
place
