hello
internet friends it is saturday night
thank you so much for spending part of
your geek end with us we
really appreciate it this is quests and
chaos
and we are playing call of cthulhu
tonight
yay before we get into the
announcements
uh i'm gonna go off script and thomas is
gonna love this
but i i'm not
i don't care how you vote i just care
that you vote
care that's all i ask given
everything that has happened in the last
i don't know
four years not not tobias how
to say how i think you should vote but
uh there's just
no way that anyone should be apathetic
at this point
learn i'm asking you to care i'm asking
you to get involved
in local elections that's really where
decisions are made
for you so please get involved
learn about the candidates pick people
that represent
you learn about the candidates at the
state level
vote every election it's so important
uh and you know
there's a a i'll just close by saying
there's a a jewish
saying that says that if there's if
somebody dies
during rosh hashanah it's because
they have they have the purest soul
essentially and
i can't think of a purer soul than ruth
bader ginsburg so
uh may her memory be a blessing as uh
um i'm a bad jew but we don't say rest
in peace
because we're smart enough to know
there's nothing after this
enjoy the life you've got and so may
her memory be a blessing
uh all right i thought you were gonna
blame people if somebody dies
the transition on that was a little odd
where is this going
are you going to tell people that if you
don't vote like a fairy's not going to
get its wings i was like
what puppies die that's it's
just true uh
rachel just made the same joke i did at
the same time although she used kittens
and no kittens don't die kittens
are forever exactly i believe that's the
next james bond movie
kittens are forever pretty exciting
uh all right uh
enough about all that let's let's
let's have fun
let's try and not think about the
outside world for a few hours
and instead see how the great dane
society can create a race war in egypt i
think it's going to be exciting what
uh regular war is fine with us thanks
uh before we get started just a few
quick announcements

have
our insane crazy giveaway the drawing

believe
i think it's the first isn't it october
1st which is technically the first week

disappointed
um nothing disappointing happens on
october 3rd

there's a website that is hopefully
showing up in the
uh in the chat that will give you
everything you need to know to get
signed up on that and get multiple
entries
it is a ridiculous amount of books uh
just a ton
of rpg books big stuff there
uh i want to i want board games are back
in in fashion on on quest and chaos
which is nice
thomas and amy are playing the new
version of blues
gloomhaven jaws of the lion and
they are they've you've already
caused all sorts of trouble
so you can see our marital bliss on
youtube
that sounds like that sounds like a
threat i'm literally
watching us argue over the reading of
the rules
it's oh it's like being in the room uh
it is it's like being back in studio all
over again um
uh so thomas is saying that technically
we draw on october 5th and i just want
to say that is the first week of october
you are absolutely correct my my
apologies i thought it was the first
um actually you know what october 5th is
the second week
in october well actually wait a minute
what do you consider a week
because like the first full week in
october starts on the fourth
the first week that that one she said

i never mind i'm already confused i
think since
the gm the way i said it is right okay
uh so a big giveaway
we've got the drawing will be
sometime in october
you can see the rules i'm sure they're
printed on that website our high-powered
lawyers have gone over every inch of it
to make sure
that the the the the accounting firm
of dewey cheatham and hal
has gone through everything to make sure
that we can uh
that everything is on the up and up uh
so
uh lastly nor our friends at nord

uh a miniatures kickstarter uh
and there are already silly stretch
goals in that thing and it's
doing all sorts of great go check it out
uh and
you can get all the minis you would
ever need
um and nord games does great stuff and
we like to support them
uh that is i think let's see so once
again i'll just run through it real
quick we have a full
calendar of televisual entertainment for
you
here on the quests and chaos network uh
monday it's dragon of ice spire peak
uh james once again jamming i um
uh i was not aware that james
apparently is being paid by the hour
and is trying to get that sweet overtime
money uh
uh those you know we need to
like i'm a firm you know i'm a firm
believer in ending on schedule i
i'm i like to really i'm just lazy
i like to not work so as soon as if
somebody says you stop work at this time
i'm stopping work at that time but
so james continuing to run dragon of ice
spire peak
several familiar faces as i said here uh
involved in that game tuesday it's
the chaos agents
actually you guys are right here
[Laughter]
i'm impressed you can yeah that's good
you can hear that i can't see the twitch
so i have no idea
tuesday it's the chaos agents doing
the crazy things that they do
it's in their blood after the after
after the info dump from
hell literally
there was a yeah thomas just read a book
through that the whole that was his
whole
when did that happen that was it
the most monologue that thomas has ever
uh and and then gloomhaven will be
coming out periodically
on youtube as they can get them um
you know they the post-production man
that's that's the trick getting the
cards
getting the card scanned takes
longer than you really think it should
yeah and
you know if they're going to do another
one of those graphic bars that's that
that
you know also too i'm also
making notes just you know for the
divorce lawyer
[Laughter]
this will be the first time that
gloomhaven is referenced in a
uh i don't know i don't believe that for
a moment i think board games are are
frequently cited i you know
i hate to break it to you but if it
hasn't happened yet no
no but i do recommend like just
playing board games with your
significant other before you get married
so those are the big talks you should
talk about money
you should what's the other one religion
and like door open or closed
that too bathroom door who's gonna mow
the lawn these are all
key topics and play a board game because
you're gonna find out a lot about that
person
i always say go on a road trip with them
but board game might be quicker
yeah yeah yeah traveling with their
traveling is a good one
with people i'm trying to think of
any
um cooking with them can be awesome
you know you find out if somebody's like
how much cinnamon did you put in there
how much did it say
you were supposed to put in there that
sort of thing laughing versus chaos
i put it in until my soul tells me to
stop yeah
that is yeah i i call my style of
cooking benign neglect
i'm a firm believer in the the low heat
and walk away that's how my mom
taught me to cook and that's how i cook
you know cook everything at a low heat
for a long time and it'll all be good
i don't know so yeah
good idea oh yeah let's we got to do
the telethon i'm sorry amy please
hang on let me get her okay i'm ready
all right so as people have told me we
start with four
yep cool cool all right and i'm gonna go
a little bit out of order i'm gonna get
a little crazy
um tamagotora has given 500 for the cult
of emma
but tamagotora has also given 500 to
ezra
friend buddy pal gentleman and a scholar
i've always said it
um squirrel has given 500 to revive dr
hollister
[Laughter]
oh my i don't know i don't know cpr
um and then ld brat has been generous
enough to give 500
i think the words cult of emma was in
there and then elder brat has also
gifted some subs to some individuals so
thank you so much yep shout out on the
chat if i missed anybody but i think
that's it right now
great oh that's that's that seven total
that we've got at the moment amy
one two three four yeah the players have
seven and i have one
um and i'm gonna use it darn it i like
that ratio it's a good ratio
i don't need to cheat yeah i know you
don't
work this down people mark it down
someone clip that please i'm begging you
um
uh elder brat also apparently gave me
500 bits
to cause a major wound oh there's
another 500 coming out for major wounds
yeah i'm full up yeah
i gotta say you know threw some serious
shade at me saying that i can't
since i can't kill characters oh i have
to give major wounds
please i like major characters it's not
that i
can't kill them it's that i choose to
continue to torment them
no keeping them alive and making them
deal with the repercussions of their
actions
that is the punishment they deserve
that's really hard because i could kill
myself and everybody else accidentally
super easy you've done it before yes
but well not killed herself but no i'm a
firm believer in in every game i run the
pcs are the actual villains
of the story yep well
yeah in fact while i was listening to
last episode back even though i'm not
i'm not supposed to know this doesn't
what's his name our australian friend
clive
i want to call him five oh and going
forward i'm just gonna forget what his
name is so didn't
owen tell us that he can banish evil and
i'm thinking to myself
if i'm at that pyramid what's going to
happen seriously
i i really i really want to know if he
means like existential other
unnatural evil or is alexandria going to
wink out of existence as well because
this might be an issue
and then who's going to do the ritual i
don't know
dr hollister no no he's
no he's terrible wow since he's not here
we all get to bed
nick isn't here so we can rag on him and
yeah i'll just say
um unfortunately nick is having some
auto
problems in the sense that he almost
doesn't have an auto anymore someone
tried to make him not have an
auto and so unfortunately nick is not
going to be able to join us tonight
so dr hollister has the emma flew
that emma had last time and actually
i want to start this episode with a
flashback
open in the basilica of saint therese of
the child
in downtown cairo as the priest
uh introduces a sister
who wishes to
ask something of the flock and then he
he turns it over to emma and this is a
um the church you know there's it's
relatively full
i'm all nervous
good morning a great evil is upon us
in less than a week an army will join
other forces from around the world
my friends and i will be larging
launching the largest battle in the
history of mankind
mankind that world should have that word
should have new meaning for all of us
today
we can't be consumed with our petty
differences anymore
we will be united in our common
interests perhaps it's fake
that june 6 you will once again be
asking
fighting for your freedom not from
tyranny
oppression or persecution but from
annihilation
we are fighting for our right to live to
exist
and should we win the day june 6th will
no longer be known as an egyptian
holiday
but as the day the world declared in one
voice we will not go quietly into the
night
we will not vanish without a fight we
are going to live on
we are going to survive today we
wow
oh no oh the spirit has moved me i gotta
go sit down
i love that movie the role of amy
uh that is yeah that rousing speech
um and and the you know it gets less
exciting once you get into the details
of you know
meet us in a barge in a couple days
and you've got to take communion and
you've got to get like you better get
exercise to your demons before you go
when you get to the part about how they
need exorcisms people get less
interested
you know that's that might be a that's a
that's a steep hill to climb there but
okay
we'll just take a confession that's fine
too yeah there you go yes yes that is
fine
um and so yeah you get several
um you get a bunch of volunteers
uh who you know
you don't really mention the blood part
so much oh dear
why would you mention that yeah why why
would it come up
so that happened
that that that amazing rousing
speech
uh happened and
we we also last episode had
um we we had
rev we found the inside of the sphinx
and
uh we met agatha bradford
who was dead
already as she herself wrote um
and was essentially right she could
write
48 hours into the future uh
and she saw the sphinx being destroyed
and you know that the
egyptian military is a is going to start
a an offensive heading
for the to try and repatriate giza
from the
the army of the black pharaoh two of
you
are still in the sphinx currently
uh emma you are after you gave your
rousing speech you stayed at the
military base
uh and you were lucky enough not to go
along
literally that that they pulled off
um and and delivered a bunch of milk
to bast and uh
only had only only gangland
executioned one person we didn't
well please go on
tell me about how you didn't execute
someone in the street
yeah me too i didn't
[Laughter]
like maybe two um
and there was so yeah there was
there was some challenges there and you
um you managed to get through
the old quarter and and back out to the
base although it was
it was touch and go there with the uh
with angry crowds
um and you also unfortunately uh
the the bad guys uh
whoever they are killed
a an army co an army corpsman
uh they they slid his throat and
anything else did anything else
happen last episode that we need to
we need to remark upon you have
five days until the full moon
i believe wait are we the 31st or the
first now
let's see here got to pull up this darn
calendar
uh yeah it is monday june 1st
the full moon is the night of saturday
so essentially you have one two three
five and a half really because it'll
uh and let's see clive
during the time you were there clive uh
dr hollister and professor lam
have been essentially recording all of
the things they've found in the sphinx
some of those things tried to kill them
but that seems to be all better now
um and there are
uh five gunmen
uh that are in there with dr clive
and have you guys told
by the way dr clive that because he
appears
not to have read agatha's book in a
little bit
and so have you told him that the
sphinx is gonna get blown up
professor lam good question
um boy yeah i think i think holly
holly did okay that sounds like a
hollister thing to do
so yeah so he is increasingly nervous
because i think that's today
tonight really yeah
[Applause]
let's see let's start in the sphinx um
and you know
hollister is is where is
continuing to record the
hieroglyphics and stuff like that
because he's he's interested in that
um clive will come up to you professor
lam
and so i read agatha's book
and we've got to get out of here
yeah no and and do we have
another place to go do you have another
bunker another
place for us to hide out in i don't who
has a backup
bunker we always have a backup place to
go
so you this is it this is all you got
yay
all right all right we gotta find
another place once i
once i turn my back on the pinhue
foundation
you know i've got my five friends
who are staying with me i've got a
gether yeah and
all right do you have any funds
well i mean i've got a little bit
all right we gotta find another place to
stay we can't just stay out here
well i'm not i'm not particularly
welcome in cairo
now we could get you in a disguise
oh that sounds exciting yeah let's let's
let's
bring agatha yes
we need to bring her why wouldn't we
well
how do you move her that your your
your doctor's got a hell i got a uh
she's asleep i haven't seen asleep but i
don't know how long
well you got these guys here they can
i suppose look we're not gonna be able
to walk
through the desert into cairo
right
and you don't have any any trucks car
you don't have anything out here
camels where where am i gonna park a
truck
sorry i didn't know the sphinx had a
stable
we've been hiding here when when you
hide somewhere
you have as little as possible with you
yeah okay then how are you going to get
food and all that kind of stuff huh
you got to go get back somebody's got to
go get stuff you can't just just sit
here
on your hands we gotta do something so
let's let's figure this out um
how do how do your guys get back and
forth they must get supplies and stuff
right
i'll talk to them i go out they go into
cairo yeah okay i'll talk to them maybe
they find a back way for us to get in
uh okay okay so yeah you'll um
um i've been learning i've been learning
the the five the five thugs will
essentially tell you that yeah they
you know they will they'll usually
wait
until a lar like a truck
of you know has come out either for
something or
um they'll they'll essentially thumb a
ride
into cairo and
they will buy whatever they need and
then they'll they'll they'll bring it
they'll bring a cab
back
do we have a an idea of how often the
they they they tell you that it's you
know it's usually
um military stuff and
uh you know it's either the the cairo
police or
or the military and that doesn't go
well for
non-arabs yeah that's not gonna help
dang well if you get a cab back you go
out there you get a cab back
we can take the cab into town right pay
him a little bit more go on the back way
yeah but well they're not australian um
well yes but how do you get a cab here
well if you guys go into town like
normal
bring your calf back i see we would
have to leave
um how much is everything
we have some food we have
much of dr clive's research
we have several
books that the mrs has written
right right well those we could put in a
cab that's not a big deal
we also have now eight people
shoot how are we gonna get out of here
um
yeah the the best idea i've got so far
is trying to get a cab maybe two
if we had two cabs we got get two people
to drive out here and drive back
then we'll have enough room to put
everything one of them
will one of them will say i will
walk into cairo and i will come back
with a truck
i it will take me some time
all right then you better get going yes
of course
yeah we don't have that much time it
is it is somewhat dangerous out there
the
the army of the black pharaoh is
around
so should you go by yourself we should
get a couple a couple of you should go
right
um i can i'll bring one of my
compatriots
so i don't leave three here we can't
yeah we um
they leave their rifles they're just
going with pistols
for a concealment right um
and they will they'll just walk off
towards cairo
um okay we will so
um back at the base
um you uh
uh the truck pulls up
and you you know you you come back in
what do you just hand the body
to somebody would i'll alert them of
course is there an emergency
we need to speak to someone okay yeah um
there will be
um the there's a there's a medic that
comes out
and quickly sees that there's not much
he can do
and so he will he will take the body um
and and as soon as that happens yeah
the co
uh will see you and he just
just tell me what happened he was
ambushed by a couple of thugs he fought
back bravely but there was
five of them and just one of him we uh
we the two fellows that were involved we
killed both of them before the rest
got away we recov we brought your man
i see all right you say
there were five of them that's what we
saw yes
and you killed
two of them the other three ran away we
um and and you had to kill those two
well the one that killed your man had to
die there was nothing about that the
other was the commander who ordered the
death
i just want to go back to something you
just said
the man that killed this soldier
had to die of course
he killed your fools we reacted
appropriately at the moment
he stabbed your man we weren't going to
just stand there and watch it occur
what would you do we we were set upon
in in a in an ambush we reacted as
quickly as we could
and reacted to um
get out of the situation and
um it was it was necessary to remove one
of them so that we could get out
you tried to save your mind i i tried to
save you
not questioning uh
what you did to say to try and save this
soldier
and i have
think you did the right thing but i'm
curious about
again the language that you sir used
when you said that the leader of this
group
um i maybe i want to make sure i don't
misquote you here
quote had to die i'm sorry
this is being recorded or something is
this is this problem
what is you speaking in a in america is
my english not good enough for you
the word choices aren't appropriate what
is it what i say
why did he have to die what i'm sorry
are you in the military you got that
badge on you those pins and stars
what does that mean they killed your we
operate
under very strict rules yeah they killed
your man
in the street like he was a dog or a
criminal
and that fellow who ordered that he died
i had no regrets about that would have
again thank you for returning
this soldier to us i will see that his
body
is returned to the states and to his
family
i'm not sure given
your statements that your continued
presence here is
an effective diplomatic
solution you're bringing up with our
commanding officer fella you're not our
boss
we don't answer to you unfortunately
at this point i'm going to look at the
ceo and say would you excuse us for a
second
and just like take donald by the elbow
and then pull him
away i don't like this fella what is it
what what what is it he's trying to not
start a war
oh the war's already started this fool
has no idea donal
understand the the the the conditions
that he's under
he is trying to maintain a a very narrow
knife edge walk and having having white
people killing
egyptians in the street is not going to
help that situation
especially with an american truck right
there what do criminals kill this man
that happens all the time it's
thuggery and robbery and whatnot on the
street
absolutely absolutely but they have to
think of the diplomatic things and this
ceo has to think of his people
uh he's a he's a military man he follows
orders he doesn't think about politics
or the people beneath him
this one does ah i doubt that
do you use this he's gonna find a way to
blame it on us
if he hasn't so far elsie
i know these feminists try to maintain
your temper
please we don't need to make enemies
here
you talk to him it's fine good time all
look miss i'm i'm oh and i'm well like i
pulled him aside far enough so that we
could have this
he did not yeah he did not he clearly
just stayed sitting
at the at the table where he was he was
not yeah
and i'll come back i'm like can we try
that again
i'm very sorry it's been a trying
morning
i i i hope you understand
the difficult situation this puts me in
um not the death
of an american soldier is always a
tragedy
but
armies aren't for vengeance we have
rules
we have guidelines we have orders
of operation and
we operate under very strict guidelines
you might have noticed that soldier that
i did notice that yes that
and i and i and i understand that we
operate under a different set of set of
rules but we are
guests on your base and i wish
with every fiber in my being that i
had the luxury that you apparently have
of taking life so cheaply
i have 432 men
because we every day
dance on the head of a pin
my entire life is based
on those 432 men
most of them boys
coming home and writing a letter to
one of those boys isn't going to do that
and i wish
god i wish that i could go and
blow up 37 people because that's what
he that's what he's worth he's worth 37
of them
but that's what a child does
that's not what an adult does an adult
lives in the responsible world an adult
understands
the situation and an adult doesn't
sit down with an officer of the law
and say that someone had to die like
there's some sort of
gang land vigilante
we're not gangsters we're the united
states
army
talk to rogers about this are we done
i think we're quite done excellent
i'm sorry and that's
not enough and it never will be enough
think about other people
think about that person that you decided
had to die think about what that one
person
think about the concentric ripples that
that one
action as good as it may make you feel
causes
jono this fellow actually in the
military
sounds like a politician to me because
he sort of has to be
he's the american presence here
don't talk to me about people dying you
don't know a bloody thing about people
dying
let's go find emma and so yeah you you
find in your little barrack room
um emma getting over about of the i
it's actually it's actually the ham the
god was striking at you for walking into
a church yeah yeah
i think it was the potato salad
pyro heat it turned yeah you can't let
it go more than two hours
yeah and i'll and and i'll i'll come
into the room first just like shaking my
head
and being going and gathering my things
yeah so emma you notice right away that
where okay so wha i don't even want to
know what happened where are we going
now
sorry donald trump again wherever rogers
decides to send us a
bastard wait
what i thought we were still going to um
to shore
in five days sure our mission of course
is is very unimportant to the fact that
this fellow has to deal with some
delicate political issue because he lost
one of his men
some street thugs in the streets of
egypt and now he's worried about
his three hundred and something other
people 391.
yes like he's never lost a bloody person
in a stupid pointless war
i explicitly didn't want to know what
happened i just wanted to know
i just already have next episode's title
[Laughter]
my stuff in a bag like backup hotel
number seven
yeah probably our best option
at the moment is to make for one of
the hotels in the international quarter
and let rogers know where we are
follow up question do we have to go at
the front door or the back door
i mean we're going out the front door
looking at the ceo well aware of where
of us not being here anymore got it
all right
um so you start packing up and about
i'd say half an hour before you're gonna
leave
um there is a knock um
on your door and a
um a very scared looking
soldier says uh
you're you're i'm sorry but we're not
letting anyone off the base right now
what's the problem fella like your
pardon there's a riot outside
yeah great lovely
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you let us know when that thing's
over we'll just
bunk up adherence in the meantime thank
you
uh okay goddamn
he's been dismissed he leaves okay like
five seconds after he leaves i was like
we gotta go find out what's up
i'll let the local authorities handle
they'll do the riot thing
let's go look like i want to go peek
over the fence where whatever or
whatever
yeah no there is there is a yeah let's
go find a spot to have a hat to have a
pants
and out so ringing
most of the base that you can see are
just
a mob a huge mob of people uh
and you know they're carrying
dead bodies they they have
uh they have two dead bodies that
they are uh
uh that they are sort of carrying above
them and they're chanting
uh do any of you speak arabic of course
not
well they're probably saying lovely
things oh i'm sure
and it's just two bodies it's not like a
ton
[Laughter]
i love emma's perspective on this
it's very hard to say that one of the
soldiers next like a soldier who's like
right and is donald with us i'm just
thinking
i'm hanging on the barracks okay good
okay
yeah so so it's me and emma going and
having a look
yeah because god knows if they saw i
gotta kill glimpse of donald we all be
in trouble
yeah well yeah each generic white guy
and an arab outfit so he's a
distinctive about donald trump yeah yeah
it seems more like
um their the the anger of the the group
is
pointed towards the millet the us and
alexander's just standing with her arms
crossed just watching this
like can we tell that or is it they're
looking for some
like they're they're blaming us because
like in my brain
i'm like alexander like what what did he
what did
what happened so
we we asked for naris's help
uh again to to help transport us
out to darshur great idea in concept
yeah in concept execution it went
interestingly
she asked for a bunch of milk and was in
in
everything's fine and and we needed to
get the
the milk to the temple in question and
uh the military is not terribly flexible
about not about letting you take other
vehicles than a uh
a military truck when you're using
military
um resources i suppose so we were
unloading by where the the temple
entrance is and the the the corpsman
got
grabbed and everyone reacted the guy got
his
gun got his throat cut and we
killed two of them and barely made it
out of old cairo
in the army truck with the body of the
corpsman
got it now i suspect they are very i
can't understand a word they're saying
but i strongly suspect
that they're very pissed off at uh
americans
at the moment alexander are you
purposefully leaving some details out
when you're talking with emma
i don't think she is i do i've
legitimately forgotten a couple things
because it's been a whole week and
work at a week in quarantine time when
you say you killed two of them
one of them was an execution yeah
i will amend that that comment because
alexandria
is she she's an assassin she's a killer
she's done this before she's still very
disturbed about what happened
and so yeah just because like in my head
right now i'm just seeing that it turned
out to be like
a fight that turned into some kind of
gun battle that didn't go well for some
people
it was a fight that that turned into
someone wounded who was shot in the back
of the head
as a justice
ah not mercy but justice got it
i think there was a question mark on
that justice there was a very much a
rising inflection on that one
donald has a very different way of
looking at things and i guess in his
head that was
justice which fair enough but
and i don't know like look at the mom
like it's caused some issues
i don't know if i mean it's not safe out
there and it's not
safe in here i mean it's safe in here
but the second we can't
we need to leave out the back door
essentially well and we need to leave
soon because the sphinx is going to be
bombed tonight
and i'm sorry what oh you missed that
part
right yes the the the egyptian
military is going to be making an attack
on giza
tonight and i'm up so i'm even even
though my tone is very forceful
alexandria is doing her very damn just
to keep her voice down
and controlled so it's just her and emma
is clear on this and the egyptian army
is going to blow this things up
that i'm kidding who's on this piece is
this part of their grandma
like did you infiltrate the egyptian
army hear their plans discovered that
they're going to blow up the sphinx and
and then what what no i i talked to
uh someone who is a king's man and
his contacts in all of the all of the
appropriate places to hear things like
that so
i heard through that that there's
going to be an attack on giza
and we know from
so there's a woman out there agatha who
is able to write the future
up to about like 48 hours and so we know
that
the sphinx is going to be destroyed and
they're in it
do i know the name agatha or no i get
the broadmoor i think you have
experience i don't think you've
encountered her at all you weren't at or
were you at the museum
when i tackled yeah okay
but do i know that agatha is with clive
well clown
did clive did say the name agatha and he
said
it's just like you said just like you
said they would
okay
well hang on so wait a minute let me go
back here
so we should walk back and get our stuff
but like what day is the egyptian
army going to attack the sphinx tonight
oh that's not that's not great timing no
it's not
it doesn't work for me i i can call them
and ask them to reschedule if you'd like
if you could to like maybe a thursday
that'd be great maybe a wednesday that'd
be fine too
like i mean it would be a great
diversion
for us to get down to the red pyramid if
all of the all of
the black pharaoh's people were coming
up here to fight
well our our hopes were that the the
egyptian military offensive on giza
would be strong enough to pull
sources up from darshur and and the
area
and in order to do that they're gonna
need a couple of days to move people
around
so i guess today is as good a day as any
yeah i mean it's a shame about the
sphinx i mean but
also has agatha predicted anything that
we know to be true at this point
i mean she was able to she was able to
predict pretty much movement for
movement what we
what we were doing like when when
that's fair when well when i
see me at the military base and then
what was the other thing that he told us
come to giza i guess i'll see you at
giza like
it's not like he didn't telegraph that
we should go meet him at giza
there was that but then he also knew
that we would be there and
exactly which book we wanted out of a
stack
of of the doctor's
piles of books he knew exactly which
book we were after
again though joan told him
not no not that particular book she
didn't she didn't know at that time
which one she wanted
but she said she wanted the book about
how um
god what's his name kurfur did like the
dimension door thing that we do
that he did that he did i don't know if
she said that to him
i don't i wasn't privy to that
conversation that's kapoor's journal and
she's already got that
yeah there there there were enough
things in there where it was
like flipping flipping through it
through pieces of her book was watching
pieces of our lives it was creepy
okay oh and she also wrote along along
the down
column of of every page i'm already dead
so that's all aren't we kind of all
inside i mean
so i we we we need to we need to
we need to be able to leave but a
military-based lockdown is no joke
oh we can escape i bet you we can so
i have two follow-up questions
um what what happened with um
i want to say bamat but it's not baymat
is it
bass kia matt and like you you you have
your head in the foxy irregular game
right now
well dindar he's not dendar anymore we
what was she going to do for us uh
trying to transport us there
i'm just wondering can we get on a slow
boat to the red pyramid right now and
get out of town
quietly well one of the things that
uh we were talking to clive while we
were out there and he said that he
he's been studying the necronomicon oh
boy
why not why not and he's figured out a
lot of the time dilation stuff that
joseph was figuring out
so he's read the thing multiple times at
this point and thinks that he has a way
to
dispel evil which is a really important
part of that ritual
he he wants to help us with the ritual
so
we need to reconnect i mean of course we
need to reconnect with joan and
hollister obviously
but do not give me that face talk
he's not telling evil it's a lot worse
than that
so we just wait until nightfall and we
sneak out of here
at that point it's too late to go out to
the spanx so if we are going to
mount a rescue for them oh i thought
they were going to
be back here well i don't i don't know
we were going to go out there but they
but then again
joan and hollister know that this is
coming and
they're very capable people if we're
not able to get out there
they'll be fun stop contradicting me you
two
everyone's like nah no yeah
i mean if they don't if they don't make
it out joan's a constant she'll pop in
from another universe or some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i
don't know
evil joan in the next universe you
mean
you mean like like evil evil aldrich in
this one
there's only one darwin yeah
they all have the potential here so yeah
i
i don't know what to say about that i'm
he and i are going to have to have a
couple of conversations and you know
you know my moral center is not exactly
pointing in the same direction as yours
and i'm still disturbed by that
exactly i mean again did he turn into
this person turn into a spider
no did they turn into a parrot shark
it was it was a senseless situation
and i hate it i i hate that
it happened i mean we might get
dispelled
along with all the other evil at this
point
i mean do not think for one second i
all right let's go pack up and see if
joan and hollister make it back yeah
all right so joan we cut back to the
sphinx
the guy they left they left actually
late last night
and so around lunchtime
they come back and they actually have a
truck
yes all right just just made it and they
have
they have not seen any any sign of
the black pharaoh's
men although it is the the heat of the
day and so usually people will
you know try and be out of the sun um
and so they start loading up the truck
with
you know a bunch with all the books with
the food that they have and that sort of
thing
you know and uh
and clive says so
are we just gonna go into cairo
that's what i'm used to doing yeah
just getting you know rooms in a hotel
saying we need to hang but um
we really can't go out to the pyramid
yet right
uh you mean joshua yeah we could yeah we
could just get in the truck and drive to
darcher
we might who knows who's out there yeah
i mean you're have you told
um clive about your your your sort of
your diversion
thought
the military i mean you guys have sort
of explicitly discussed
you know having the military egyptian
military to like do an assault that will
draw the the focus of the
right but the since we know
this sphinx is gonna go up though
that is another that would
draw a lot of things there too um
but yeah yeah yeah yeah no we discuss it
because at this point
you know even though i think he messed
me up he's still one of the smartest
guys here so
i've been talking to him a lot all right
uh
i mean if you're gonna watch so this has
to happen on the full moon
right yes yes so um
sure is you know about a day's drive
away
we have six days five days from now and
i guess
it might be easier to go to ground in
joshua yeah
i think that might be a good thing but
how am i going to get the info back to
do you know where they are well
they're they're at the army compound um
the u.s army compound well i i don't
i don't think going there is a good idea
yeah
i don't think so either but i need to be
able to get a a message to them there
can you pop something over there to them
teleportation spider
yeah that's what i'm saying can you pop
something over to there to them
well about that
oh all right what have you not been
those those spiders you see
uh you know they've got to come from
somewhere
right yeah
okay so it's a blood sacrifice
oh even better so those okay no no
no no no open a hole and throw a note
through
well i need the spider the spot is what
oh
i thought i can make you a spider
relatively quickly
no no we need all the peeps we got right
now okay
i didn't phrase that exactly right i'm
not gonna make you a spider
thank you but no we just we don't
have enough peeps to be able to to do
that we need these guys to help us
so you don't have any other way to send
a note or do anything you have to
make the spider
and the spider is the one who takes it
all right
is the one that lets me travel right the
now it could be that i could create a
spider out of somebody
uh a less than willing subject
say
that's even worse is it
i mean we find a soldier of the black
pharaoh
like jump somebody and then i turn them
into a spider
they let us teleport it's a victimless
crime
practically well no see no no no no i
don't think we need i think we just need
to get we have a truck we got a truck we
can go
what i'm trying to do is send a message
to our friends
so i don't need i can get you inside
that military base no problem
all i need is you know someone to turn
into a spider
but then could i get them all back could
we could we could we get them
and bring them or do you need more
spiders
no i think if we you know if we had the
now usually the spot is good for about
one trip before it
uh dries up a little goes a little
agatha if you know what i mean
hmm
well okay but you and agatha came
through it during that one thing so
you're saying
i would have to go in you'd have to have
another spider to bring us back
no no it's it's a there and back sort of
thing
but okay really they can only open the
portal once
okay so the portal's open it's open
people can come in and out
right while it's open you know i've
found about two hours
damn i mean how do you feel about that
oh not holly he's a pain in the butt but
i don't know what had happened but we
could i mean agatha's dead already
man oh we need her we need her too man
that's the thing is
we need we need we need bodies we need
people we need things
you can't do it with animals it's just
hell i mean we could we could go find
are you serious are you being serious at
ah i don't understand the rules of this
game
you wanted a spider i'm telling you how
okay well i'm trying to help
yeah i understand i understand but
dang cause well we need to get something
to the
to to to our friends so they know where
we're going we're going to go to darcher
we're going to get there
you you so we're just going to go to
deshour and wait until a full moon and
figure that your friends are going to be
there
maybe we go to shore and we find
somebody who's awful
and we turn them into a spider and then
they're a door
or somebody who tries to to to to do
something to us
got it okay all right
let's go to de shore and then we'll see
when we get there
all right so i'm going to till
um i'm going to tell my pals to finish
loading up then we're going to get in
the truck and we're just going to make
straight
we're just going to go we don't want to
be anywhere near here when it blows
up no no pity about the sphinx though
isn't it
yeah god i wanted to explore it so much
more but
we gotta go all right i have all my
notes we have all the notes we have all
the notes we've got hollywood
make sure that all the books and stuff
are packed agatha
is on a bed hollister and agatha are
in the back of the truck
uh with the gunman so so is holly is
holly just laid out now i mean he's
he seems to be very concerned with
agatha okay and he is clearly he's
helping her see that's why we need him
that's why i tell
i tell i tell him this look at this is
why we need him man there it is
okay i'll take your word for it well
he's keeping me sane-ish
look i i don't i don't judge who it is
why whatever you need a spider i can
make you a spider
all i need is some raw material
yeah all right let's go
let's get out of here yeah you guys book
it out of there for sure
uh all right we'll come back to the
military base and yeah you can
um you are confident that you guys can
especially with you know some disguise
and
and stuff you can get out of the base
that's no problem
uh without being seen there the the
animus of the crowd
seems to be specifically towards the
base
and you know and towards the military
towards the us
so so as long as we don't draw and
don't draw their attention and
be be elsewhere go out the back door as
emma put it
where are we going now um
what day did i tell the fl the
volunteers to
meet me they are going to be in joshua
on the morning of the 5th
okay so i just need to get there on the
morning of the 5th and i'm assuming
there's another church there that i'm
going to meet them at there is not a
church in joshua
where am i where was i some of them um
you just said at the dock
because you don't know anywhere in
um we do assuming that that neris got
uh the the delivery we do need to
touch base with her and the safest place
for
us to do that and her to do that is
somewhere in cairo proper
so maybe go go to the international
quarter
we need we need to get out to
[Music]
to recover would be good the ones we're
left going in
say that one more time we should recover
the other two before the
conflict occurs today sundown yeah
get a cab out there again i don't know
so the base is definitely on the
outskirts
so you know to get a cab you'd probably
need to like it would be a hike
yeah well and i mean i i've basically
resigned
myself into thinking that we're going to
have to be on foot to get from the base
into cairo proper
and more specifically somewhere where
it's safe to be white
safe right
so we look at the international corridor
find a way to recover the other two
i think so make contact with with past
and find out about transportation
and also make contact with rogers and um
and and what we've learned i think well
i think emma were you successful you've
got enough people to participate in our
little fun and games
i mean did i get when i was there did
people did like
did somebody come did i get like a
little sign-up sheet
what is that did i get my god girls
buddy who's like i will follow you
anywhere you are the true like
several several people were like very
you know
yes we we we must help you of course how
can we
you know what do you need and then you
you did the ask of you know
being doshur on this day and they were
like
that's weird okay it's a pilgrimage okay
yeah so i'm assuming i'm assuming at
least two will show up i mean
given the numbers i mean you know how
people say yeah i'm gonna show up and
then
you know they don't to a party so i'm
saying about probably somewhere between
20 of who committed so yeah about two
i was very concerned about how many
people said they were interested
i'm just basing it on the rsvp numbers
you know well and i don't think that's
going to be enough
we we said that we that we needed around
11 to 12. you feel like i mean
so based on what you did you feel
like
15 people were possible
yeah so it's out of 15 people i'm saying
at best it would be 10 or 11.
um 10 or 11
10 11 would be enough but
are they all in this so emma are you
mentioning to them that you didn't
tell these people anything about you
know donating blood
what do you mean i don't know oh okay i
don't have sneeze anymore i'm sure what
you neglected to mention in your
arousing don't call it independence day
speech
um that that that you need their
blood
oh i completely neglected to tell them
that otherwise who would show up i mean
come on
well yeah but we're also neglecting to
telling uh
alexandra and donald that oh no i'll
tell you guys that i completely
neglected to tell them about that
and then i also probably need some money
because we're probably going to have to
like i don't know
bribe them with food and drink maybe
plan with a little liquor get them
loosened up get them out there and then
explain that it's just going to be a
good old-fashioned old testament
you know bloodletting hello innocent
person we need to get you drunk
it's a damn shame that that sentence is
too long to be a to be a title because
that sentence was i
was perfect which part of it the whole
thing
oh outstanding oh man little fashion old
testament bloodletting
boy if that wouldn't cause youtube to
it's not wrong is this ritual ready to
go because
we still the error is not secure we
haven't figured that
down problem out either well yeah
clive clyde was saying that that he
could oh yeah
clive was saying he could summon things
from the necronomicon
clear out the area and then dismiss them
oh boy yeah that was my response to but
be careful what you wish for i believe
he did say you probably didn't want to
be around when he did that
very much so i i am clinging to the
oh so we have to hope that whatever
horrible ritual he does is successful
and then we have a very small window to
go after that
concluded hope we have enough people
show up for our party invite
which we didn't even tell about the damn
parties about oh boy
again i'm gonna provide food and drinks
it's a party
[Laughter]
emma's got a great playlist
exactly i got a dj coming we're to
release some doves
later it's going to be amazing well i
i i i think i think it's your turn to
wire for money i had to do it for the
okay it's got a hotel in the city let's
figure the rest of this out
exactly but first we have to get off the
space
oh yeah you get out of the base no
problem hooray everything is really
you know they're all focused on the
front gate uh
and most of the you know the the
soldiers
are definitely alert there
um but they're nobody seems sad to
see you go
i don't know and so you head out and um
you are you know you're you're slightly
disguised you have those robes that you
bought
um so that gives you some cover hair
covering for sure because
bright red hair is one of those things
yeah and
you you know it is probably by the
time you get out of the base
it's about one and it will be
nick and
uh you know by the time you get into
uh downtown cairo it'll be about four
and so you by four you'll have a hotel
and you'll be all set
um i i think that before we go out there
we need to get a quick telegram off to
after rogers we can do that in the city
of course
hoping you were sending a telegram to
the sphinx that would be a fun
thing for the sphinx
the sunset's relatively late i we need
to go though
i don't want to necessarily go outside
of this quarter after dark
i definitely do not want to go outside
all right so i think that once you know
we're settled in the hotel
obviously under our our fake fake
names
um and go find a cab that'll take us out
to giza i guess
all right yeah you can find and hope
that and i hope that we can find a
pretty good sized cab because i remember
how many people are out there
[Music]
that is a little trickier you're i
mean
essentially if you're willing to pay
then they'll send three cabs out there
okay so all right the three of you
make me luck rolls
i thought for a second my luck was 70. i
was like that would be amazing
nope down all right so only one success
all right so do we want to spend inspo
on it
my luck is shh it might
so if you want to my luck is only 30 so
that is that is a cthulhu sentence in a
nutshell like
when you have less than 50 percent
you're in skill and you're like
i got this yeah well i did it's a 15.
uh oh all right i just rolled an art
one
thank you by the way godzilla said it
today
no you haven't of paradise the official
dice
of anything i do from now on birds of
paradise
are the best we love them and
uh you should go and oh those are
those the magpie yeah these are this is
this is one of the earlier prototypes of
the magpie this isn't
the the correct version that andrea has
but i'm gonna
those are really nice just out of
curiosity yeah
yeah those are magpies as well the black
and the white ones
uh there are new designs coming out all
the time
uh very exciting to see what's what
what's going on over there you can use
we have a code which i think is showing
up in the chat right now i think it's
chaotic
if you go to birds of paradise.com uh
and
use the code chaotic you get 15 off your
order that's not nothing
that pays for shipping and tax probably
i think so actually and again
every time you order from birds of
paradise you get a little d
d stat block that's super cute it's
really funny i like it
andrea sent me a card to a thank you
card there you go
hoping that my dice will protect me from
emma's roles
[Laughter]
nice so
uh you you come out you have a
caravan of cabs driving out to giza
and about uh
three quarters of the way there you are
outside of cairo
on your way to giza you come to a
checkpoint
and and it two guys that look like
soldiers will stop the
uh will stop the car and
uh they will talk to the driver
they'll say some stuff in arabic to the
driver
and the driver turns back and looks you
and says
um the army says we shouldn't go any
further
there's they're gonna do something
right well we know that's why we're
trying to get her quickly um
let's see how much money this fellow
oh okay he'll he'll
like he goes he says on the guy the
soldier
laughs and then the so the soldier will
come back to the back window
and he'll tap his rifle on the window
as like a you know a roll down the
window thing
i've still got those those mexican stuff
i just cover his mouth i'm like twenty
dollars
exchange rates the principle of the
thing is so upsetting to him
like i don't care if you bribe someone
but don't don't spend more than you have
to
my god i've got this money from
shanghai i'm never going to use again
that's right those like gold those
the mexican for
dollars silver dollars god willing we
never have to use those
would give me fifty dollars forty
all right you give me forty dollars
that's all you emma
i've just got larger bills
i literally were you waving your money
around donald
trump pulled out my billfold but yeah no
i'm upset
i pay him the 40 and just i'm like
amateur hour around here
can i get a receipt oh poor silvano oh
[Music]
he sort of he sort of smirks and he says
i would uh
i would be out of there before uh
you know before dark we plan on it
got it thank you so now as you come over
the rise
um you can see the pyramids there
and you see a lot of there are a lot of
figures around the pyramids
and to the left a little bit away
from the uh
a little bit away from the from the the
is the sphinx and there are there are
not
so many guys around that but there
are definitely like people
around there and behind the rise
where you were coming up where the
where the checkpoint was
there is a definite gathering of a
military presence
there's a there's a lot of trucks guys
are getting out of trucks
do the people around the pyramids look
oh yeah oh around the pyramids they
don't look i mean they're
it's really far away right now they look
like
ants probably the black parrots meant by
the pyramids
and here's where the egyptian loyalists
are they're asked
probably i don't like that there's a lot
of them how do we get
to joan and the doctor
can we drive pretty much up to the foot
of the spanx or no yeah i mean you can
but
but these cabs are pretty conspicuous
yeah
well but also you know a a group of
people walking into the sphinx and
walking back out are not inconspicuous
especially on an open desert
i was about to say if can we make this
quick and like drive up
okay we're going to load it in and drive
exactly we're hey
no i i i would i would prefer if if we
could take a bit of
a circuitous route to avoid most of the
people that would be great
but i i think that we need to get in
and get out quickly and
driving up is probably the easiest way
to do that yeah before the conflict
starts
okay yeah you will so all three of
you make me luck rolls
yay
yeah got it a whole hole
i got a five hey thank you yeah so
you all nobody met you don't get any
sort of
uh attention from any of them
uh and you come sliding around
and you will uh
uh you'll be you're on sort of the
other side of the sphinx
um you can climb you climb up
and you remember where the where the
uh the
and in fact you climb up and the trap
door is open
i i like see that and immediately draw a
let's let's start quiet if they if
they've been set upon they might not
hear us coming
let's go oh my gosh and ezra i'm only
going to go
up like a little bit i'm going to keep
an eye like i want to be within shouting
distance of both the cab
and these guys so i don't know you are
perched on the like back of the sphinx
watching the
guys from the pyramids and keeping the
um so you two will drop down and um
this place has been cleared out in a
hurry
this doesn't look good are they gone
already there are all sorts of boot
prints on the floor
um the food is gone agatha is gone
your friends are gone is there any
is there any sign of a struggle not
really
yeah i i'll i'll quick search let's look
quickly
make sure we don't see the dead bodies
let's go yeah you see no
well actually let me amend that in one
of the back
chambers there are definite signs of a
struggle
there was a there was a fight there are
um
um there were multiple people involved
in some sort of gun fight
but there's no body left over behind are
there no bodies
not even of the spider thing i don't
even think there's any blood that's
weird yeah there's no blood
well there's two options i suppose
either
they were set upon and subdued and taken
out but then why take all of the food
and the writings and everything else
or they fought something and left
because it wasn't safe here anymore
i think they cleared out it was going to
blow up
well not safe here anymore is a wide
what but joan didn't how do we she
didn't tell us where she left we don't
know where they're going
no hollister and joan did not they could
go back to the base
i don't know back up hotel i mean our
our our mo is always go and get
a hotel but we didn't have a hotel or a
backup at this moment so they wouldn't
do that
because they know we couldn't find them
there if it's not the base the only
other logical
place is
that fella though the australian fellow
was going to do the ritual a couple days
before right
five yes which is what two days from now
something like
it's and darcher is a bit of a way so
maybe
i hate it when people don't communicate
with each other it drives me insane
all right i imagine joan might try to
contact us
at the base that's all she would know as
far as to find us
well and they would they won't know
where to find us
because we we didn't leave officially
although
well well we could literally officially
you were never
the there will know where we are and if
they can get a message at the end we can
get a message back to us
but other than that they don't
contact us
he won't know where we are we'll tell
him from the hotel we can sit on the
telegram
where to find us
might get conveniently lost along the
way but we can we can try
what do you mean that poor telegram guy
showing up in the middle of a riot
i have a telegram for the us realist
pigs
telegraph offices are everywhere in
every city so they could notify what not
well is is there would we think that
there's a a telegram
set up in the base itself oh there'll be
something enough something quite
possibly quite possibly we might we
might be able to send a telegram
directly into
the the base i mean it so the trick
is
if there is a telegram in there it is um
it is strictly for like you know
military community you know it's
yeah it's not on the it's an unlisted
number
yeah let's get out of here before the uh
the black feral folk
take notice of us all right let's go
let's go i just rolled to see if
hollister would have left a note and i
rolled a hundred
he's very concerned about agatha that's
very much a
no very concerned about agatha
yeah and he's pretty sure that he
shouldn't have eaten that curry last
night
okay fair enough all right so yeah we'll
we'll
we'll come back out of the sphinx and
i'll like slide down the
the back of the head to the the body and
that they're gone
okay so did they say where they were
going no note no
anything there are signs of a struggle
but only in one room
and i'm not confident that's the reason
i'm not confident that that is
a sign that they are in trouble
necessarily if that makes sense
doesn't that doesn't mean anything not
necessarily
i mean they could have very well knocked
them out and taken them captive
depending on
what happened maybe bad guys use ether
joan they're never capturing joe i'm not
i'm not worried about her
she'll take them along with her okay
okay all right um
so they're either going back to the base
or to
what was the hotel that we had that we
went that we go
that we're at who are at
if i remember anymore did you you
probably didn't go to a fancy place
i'm guessing no because i'm just i'm
assuming we went to the hotel that we
were
not the ones that we burned down
sorry where was the what was the last
hotel that we went to like meet with
some but who the hell did we meet in a
hotel lately
[Music]
carmichael i kind of want to say the old
but you know you're out you're at a
you're staying at a hotel you've stayed
at before
okay yeah do they recognize us
uh if they do they have the good grace
not to admit it
kind of them no it's a hotel they act
like they recognize everyone
yeah i i we didn't pass anyone coming
back that direction that we were also
gone for almost
two full days so i mean if they were
leaving the sphinx we might have
actually seen them on the road
heading back into town we didn't see
that either exactly
and and and they didn't come to the base
and we were there until just a few hours
ago
i said we wait for a short time see if
they contact us and if not
um
let's just go back to the hotel at this
point right so you guys are getting in
your cabs
driving back yeah
okay you you cross the lines
just as the offensive begins and so
like as you drive over the hill
armored cars drive uh
uh down the dune and just start firing
uh opening up on the armies of the black
pharaoh that
seem that
that seem very surprised by all this
and you will you will make it
back to the hotel and i think that's as
good a place as any to
take our first break so if you want
to win
a set of these coasters from the
baroness someone in chat said they smell
really good
i don't maybe i've had mine too long i
don't know i they don't really smell
like much to me
like in the wood burn bit because it
i'll take your word for it so hashtag
chaos
if you want to win those super cool
coasters
it's a set of four coasters again the
rules are pretty simple
continental us and canada except quebec
because quebec and
uh we will uh
ship those out and i guess we will see
you
when as soon as one two three four five
people can use five bathrooms and we
find nick
and we find nick we're going out of
[Music]
so
[Music]
welcome back friends and if you are just
joining us
you're nick hi nick welcome back
hey i'm alive
see your friend dr hollister in the
flesh
is so much better than dr hall i mean i
like i prefer prefer it when nick rolls
the hundreds than when i roll the
hundreds i got good ideas
um so we're gonna roll the winner
very shortly of that and i just want
to jump in
the chat is having a spirited discussion
about what would be salon
the the equivalent of cilantro
yeah yeah that's a good quote good call
[Music]
uh but they also are saying that
you're you're you you could have been a
spider
nick if you i just tried hard enough uh
nathaniel lachlan
has won the has won the the set of
coasters congratulations nathaniel
they're wonderful i'm not taking my
drink off of them
yeah i i i have two drinks i'm not
taking anything we have to
everybody cough up your coasters we have
to send them to nathaniel
uh yeah send me one each uh
you'll just reach out to quests
and chaos on here i guess
what's it called whisper whisper yeah
yeah if you just whisper to them
your details we will get those off to
you as soon as thomas feels safe
going into the post office sometime
um and tamagotora has 500
bits for hollister recipe to rogers
what recipe what am i doing making a
spider
it turns out that clive can make those
portal spiders
he just needs some raw materials
it's soylent green like hair does he
need my hair
uh you know i just i i i used to be able
to turn into a spider and then i was
cursed
i'm no longer a candidate what yeah
anti-spider bodies don't know my back
story
accurate accurate
uh so we hollister
and professor lam are on a truck
trundling off to joshua uh
the rest of the great danes have
returned to their hotel in cairo
and it is the knight of the first
and you clearly uh
uh in from cairo you can hear the sounds
in the in the in the
yeah and
um the papers
uh the pa the papers have stories
about
uh riots at the u.s embassy riots over
the so as you recall the papers
when the british left took a
um a nativist turn and so the papers are
talking about the the senseless
murder
of egyptian youth by by the the
americans
and there is a
uh you know there's a whole story
about the riots and
um a lot of use of the tur of the word
righteous
there's some there's some martyr
slung around
uh i'm honestly amazed that
that the the papers are still in
english
there is one i mean wasif is the only
uh and so it is the night of the first
unless
uh unless anybody wants to do
anything i think we're just gonna go
ahead and head to the second
well
or something give them a chance to get a
hold of us right yeah you guys are
waiting at the hotel well we wouldn't at
the hotel but i think we also wanted to
get a telegram to rogers
and fill him in on a bit of what's going
on um
just just mostly so he knows where to
look for our bodies because at this
point
nice all right what are you what it
what are you telling rogers
um because often what you do what you
don't
tell him is more important than what you
tell him that's accurate i will
we will tell him and guys if jump in
if i missed something but
um i think we'll tell him that we're no
longer on the base
um we have
the the three of us have been separated
from lamb and hollister
um we have
the volunteers that we need i'll like
look over at emma as i'm writing that
out
send money let's say yes to her
uh send money
why not we need more funds
i was like every chance you get ask for
money those should be
money back giving it back as long as
long as it doesn't pass through
hollister so it gets given back i'm fine
with this
yeah i was about to say when in doubt
get a bicycle get a grenade get some
money
get a backup hotel we should have like
the
we should have just the general like f
top 5 10 rules
all the time yeah these are the we do
these
these are the ten commandments of the
great danes
oh that's good but yeah let it
letting him know that we've been
separated from lamb and hollister and
we're going to be making our way out to
darshore
um in a couple of days we're hoping to
to meet up with them but we're not sure
where they are
um i think that's ever i think
those are the highlights that i want to
hit because i don't want to mention
about
neris and i'm keeping an eye out for
cats to see if i can
chat with her but right let's just give
them just give them the basics we're on
mission
we have we're here for a reason we got
to keep that goal in mind
yes
all right so assuming you guys don't
have anything that you want to add
that's the telegram that i'll send with
that information
okay that's fine and are you
are you giving him um
are you are you giving him any sort of
here we're at this location if you need
to contact us or something
yeah we should right he knows our fake
identities right at this point we would
have told him by that by now
yeah i i i'm i'm going to say that that
for upset
no if he needs to find us look uh
start we start calling around to the
hotels and look for
i don't remember what your guys are but
at least in irene adler okay
[Music]
um and basically end it with you know if
if you if you need to find us we're
we're in a hotel and just leave it at
that
that's a good idea okay
uh so at least he knows where to narrow
it down
a hotel in cairo a hotel in in the
international quarter that narrows it
down
even further there you go all right yeah
you
you will send that off and
you you know you ask the front desk
to let you know if your fellow guests
show up and they keep saying oh i'm
sorry you know they haven't come yet
and you you know it is now
night time yeah and i'm keeping an ear
out to see if naris is reaching out to
me
i i want to make sure that you know
we're good to go in a couple of days
are we on the second third please oh
sorry go ahead tom what are we on
in this hotel you're on the third floor
of a four-story hotel
just keep an eye on the balcony you
never know when the cats decide to jump
on the balcony and
say hello so yeah i mean cats are
clearly freaked out by the artillery
and i would be freaked out too i am
freaked out like alexandria isn't is
holding it together but artillery is not
a sound that she likes at all
it's going to be hard to sleep tonight
it's a you know just a con a dense
distant thud
[Music]
and in the actually in the in the main
room of the hotel
when you come in there are a bunch of
people gathered around the radio
and they are listening to an arabic
program
um that seems to be uh
well it seems to be in arabic for the
um when when
when we pass by i'll look and see if
there's anyone that i
would guess might speak english and see
if i can find out what
the radio program is saying yeah a
guy will tell you that
um that it's it's sort of reporting
about
a major offensive by the egyptian
military against the army of the black
pharaoh
and that the ministry has um
is is announcing the retaking of
um the uh
the the birthright of egypt our our
our majestic history the valley of the
kings
from what he's saying does it sound like
the egyptian army is being successful
based on the information getting so far
yes the ministry makes it sound like
they're being very successful bias
report
anything that comes in is probably a
little propaganda the fire
the poorest and the poorest things
anyway
but yeah i'm i'm keeping an eye out on
the on the balcony for
a cat and if a cat doesn't show up then
i have nothing else i want to do
tonight just hang out
yeah just getting drunk and watching the
fireworks
um unfortunately they're a little
distant but you can definitely every
once in a while there's a good flash
um about
12 30 in the morning there is
um there there is a
very large explosion and the sky is lit
up
briefly it's not one actually
let me rephrase that about 12 30 in the
morning there is a massive
um cannonade of artillery fire just a
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
uh
over and over and over just unceasing
artillery fire
um none of you were soldiers
no i mean you were sort of a soldier but
not really
not world war one no the different kind
of war yeah yeah
there was much less artillery in your
war a lot more explosions have been on
artillery yeah that's right yeah
um so so you know yeah
you don't get anything from that but yes
there is definitely a sustained
uh bombardment of some sort
and you you finally drift to sleep with
kind of the
the the the distant thuds almost
becoming a little hypnotic
[Music]
and you all have the same dream
uh you you wake up and you are standing
on a dune overlooking uh
the valley of the kings and you see
the army of the black pharaoh there
are
soldiers there most of them look like
normal dudes
uh wearing like black and they're
heavily armed
um and they are firing at
what you assume are the placements of
the uh
of the egyptian military it seems to
be
pretty much a standoff the egyptian
military has
artillery the the the army of the
black pharaoh
uh is taking advantage of the fact that
they are not shooting anywhere near the
pyramids
uh they don't want to damage it it's
clear
from what you can see that they don't
want to damage these
uh these treasures and so you know
the soldiers of the black pharaoh are
just
sort of using the the pyramids as
cover and firing shooting at the
soldiers
you you see from your dune you
make an amazing spot hidden roll
and you see in the front
of the sphinx is sort of to the front
and to the left
of the pyramids and you see on top of
the sphinx
a number of figures and you zoom in
one of the figures they're all soldiers
in the army of the black pharaoh
one of them pulls out a knife and starts
cutting throats of these guys uh
and as their throat and they just stand
there and as their throat cuts
instead of blood out comes light
and this light is a
a bright red
and about the fifth guy whose throat he
slits with a knife that looks kind of
familiar
not the exact same but very similar uh
about the fifth one that he saw he
slices
the sphinx's eyes open and they are that
and the very last one this guy takes
this
takes the knife and he stabs his own
heart he stabs himself
in the heart and
he starts to evaporate
in red light um
it it it sort of emanates out from
him from the heart
all through his body and that light
is absorbed by the sphinx and
all of the sudden the sphinx stands
on its four legs and roars
and it's at that point that the
artillery barrage that you heard
starts as as panicked
officers just start firing everything
they have at the sphinx and the sphinx
starts to just trundle slowly forward
crunch
crunch crunch bam and just
artillery is firing into it and soldiers
from the black pharaoh are running
up the hill with the sphinx and they're
like they're they're
they're they're not even paying
attention as the sphinx tramples them
uh and the sphinx is just
implacably slowly moving forward
pieces of it are getting blown off and
and and pieces of it
uh keep coming off the sphinx
makes it to the front line
of the egyptian military and there is
all of the sudden
uh with the with the army of the
black pharaoh
it is like hand-to-hand combat as this
horrible scene
you somehow see from a uh
uh from a bird's-eye view as this
66 foot tall 200 foot long
statue just rampages it
you know at one point you see it just
crush an armored car
as it steps on it but what it is no
match for
is 20 minutes of concentrated artillery
fire
the artillery is a good ways away and it
never reaches it
uh one leg of the sphinx gets blown off
and it it it like
flops down and it's still coming
mindlessly
it's just destroying things and
so you watch as over the course of
more almost an hour they they literally
just blow
the sphinx to pieces with
artillery slowly but surely and as
they're doing this
the the the the
egyptian military is falling back and
the army of the black pharaoh
has taken that rise and the rubble
that was the sphinx is
uh is essentially kind of the new
uh trench that that the army of the
black pharaoh has taken foot in
uh and and
you will wake up the next morning and
you'll read reports
uh the ministry report has is reporting
in the papers
that the the villains of the army of the
black pharaoh
have sabotaged one of egypt's great
treasures the sphinx
they have destroyed the sphinx and you
know the army will rest
at nothing to repay uh
to reclaim the valley of the pharaohs
and they they say that the fighting is
ongoing and you know there's still
sporadic artillery fire there's no
but the artillery does seem a little
and so you three wake up and it is now
june
2nd
of course no joan no dr hollister they
did not come in
so joan and dr hollister you
make it into doshur about 4 30 in the
morning
um one of the
one of the henchmen knows
a so doshura has basically fallen to
the army of the black pharaoh
but it's behind the front enough that
there are not like there's not a huge
uh group here the village itself
is in very bad shape it was it was
uh burnt but um
they the you know they the
one of your henchmen finds like a a
stone
uh a standing stone building that the
truck can fit in and
and so you're you're essentially hiding
in this building
i love how you said that we have a
henchman you have uh
you have right now you have five sorry
six
uh gunmen you have dr clive
and agatha right and
do i think it's close enough to start uh
feeding her like like small amounts of
stimulants to try and
uh hard success
all right yeah so you you managed to
catch some sleep in the truck
so you feel pretty good so you feel like
yeah you could start that process
okay it's gonna be let's call it a
medicine roll
and of course i'm i'm assuming that i'm
still uh
slowly just getting whatever any food or
like mostly like broths or stuff into
yeah that would be a five
would be a critical success on medicine
damn
all right yeah so you you bring her over
the course
of about puree a steak i'm sorry i'm
sorry
over the course of about two hours you
slowly bring her back
to consciousness and about an hour and a
half you've done this for about an hour
and a half
and all of a sudden her hand just raises
up
i'm assuming i kept her i kept her stuff
to
i can hand her a pen and i can probably
she's like lying she's lying on her back
her eyes are closed she's out but her
hand has started writing
and it's just scribbling in the air do i
think i could set her up like prop her
up
and get it so that she's not five one
hundred percent you can uh
yes so what happens now is
agatha slumped forward in a chair and
and i'll be i mean well i guess i
want to focus on
her still joan john you want to come
over here and see what she's writing
yeah all right i'll come over and
see if i can see so maybe oh yeah i'll
call clive over as well
because he's i figured agatha's
she's she's slumped up for now but we
don't know how long
he'll be holly how'd you do that
oh just gradually dosing her with uh
stimulants
ah yeah i that was what i was doing
with the cocaine uh
uh all right well but the other
principle you had the principal right
so we're keeping agatha then
yes yeah
alternative alternative right
i i'm going to say hey why don't you
stick here
uh tell clyde stick here with aga for a
second let me bring holly up to speed
and i'm gonna
tell the doctor about the the spiders
and how they are that yeah raw material
means you transform a person into a
spider and that's how he does this
he wanted me to pick a gunman that he
could change into a spider we have not
been able to talk to our compatriots yet
um i do want to get in touch with them i
was i was going to see if
maybe they got in touch with rogers but
i don't think there's going to be a
telegraph place around
here i mean at this point unless we can
send uh
one of our henchmen back with a
message
we don't have too many options do we
think that we could
ambush one of the cultists and use
him as materials
that was one of the things that we were
trying to figure out or somebody who
comes after us
if there's somebody who notices us and
we capture them then
yeah but they're not as
willing so i don't know if that's yeah i
gotta talk to clive
no it works fine don't worry you're the
yeah you're the one with the crowbar so
just make sure they aren't injured
that's the only thing
oh that's injured i could inject them
with something i've got enough sedatives
okay you you hold them down i'll inject
uh
it seems like they're pretty simple you
have ether
i also have class either and ether takes
like people think ether is just gonna
like magically
so we do need to get a hold of them i'm
not sure where they are right now last
time
we saw them they were at the base yeah
they just left and they never came back
we we don't even i mean i hate to say it
we have to go forward with the
assumption that we might have lost them
and if we do send a runner we have to be
incredibly
careful about the information that we
send i don't think we have any sort of
uh
i'm not sure what we would put in a
message that that couldn't reveal what
we're doing to the wrong people
i'm pretty sure that we had a code at
some point so i'm i'm trying to get that
i have some i have some codes with
working with rogers
but that would be you know get this to
the military base and the military base
can get this to rogers and then rogers
can get back to them
assuming they haven't done something
insane and aren't
destroying cairo with a mummy
yeah yeah so we're kind of out on our
own right now we've got to make that
assumption but i god i still want to
try to get them a message
i mean because you know but i mean if
they're going to have to come here
right i mean there wouldn't be this is
where they push forward
and i'm saying i could get you there all
we need is some raw materials
all right so i mean if if uh
yeah i think i think there's not there
there's not gonna be large numbers which
means if we can
identify someone who's definitely
cultist and get them separated
oh oh has has agatha written anything
about that could retroactively
describe
what we've done so you go and you look
at what
what is writing she is writing
one sentence over and over
and over and she has now written it
hundreds of times and all it says
is the black pharaoh is coming and we
knew that
yeah and that's you know that's
interesting
really cuts down on the ominousness of
what what i'm surprised about i think
she's made some real progress a real
breakthrough here because before
he she couldn't see anything pertaining
to him there you go
so i think i think she's taking it to
the next level
do we do we need to stop her from doing
this
over and over and over again maybe if
you bring her back
i mean she's going to come back more on
her own she is kind of out of it
right now so she
might be on the default setting all
right so
yeah yes all right clive what do you
think
do you think that your guys could go out
and grab us a cultist we could use for a
spider
well i think do we want to
oh you were saying polly i was saying
but i was saying
why well
because we're more familiar with some of
the things that can happen
uh i used to work for cultists just so
we're clear
well yeah but we're not asking you to go
they used to work with me when i
worked for cultists they said a few
things
yeah but you agree they have that degree
of separation
and also i have the sedatives well
that's true
that's true look but
let's try my guys see if we get anything
if not then you go
well i mean i think your guys are best
for going out and scouting around
they're going to be less conspicuous
than us so maybe they just want to do
they just want to scout and then come
back and we can go from there
well they can buy somebody if they see a
great opportunity and they think they
can bring someone back
uninjured i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't
stop them
i can see this is very important to you
so we're going to do what you we're
you are the psychiatrist um
so yeah he'll go over and he'll talk to
his guys and they will
and he'll hang he's he goes back over
by agatha
and he's kind of like you know i'm gonna
i'm gonna go back over there too and
just
just tend to her um
i'll i'll try to talk to her i'm
assuming i've been doing that just even
if she's asleep and out and i'll just
try and
i'm just doing the best i can it
probably won't help but you never know
i also i also knew on to talk to clive
about he said he could summon
things to help clear all the evil out
from the area and when is he prepared to
do that
well i mean i could do it right now but
you don't want me to
no not yet not yet we want it really
close so
the evil stays away with summoning right
if you don't know the bind spell as well
summoning
is a tricky little thing you don't know
the buying spell
i didn't say that
you implied that it was tricky
i know several buying spells
and some of them are things i can summon
yeah
well it sounds like we need to have the
bind and the evil things
we need both of those right oh there's
well you said you were going to use
something to
things that could clear out the area
right
right yeah okay so we have
what five days by the way hollister
uh make me a psychology role
uh the one thing i'm not so great at
well you are the psychiatrists we have
i've got i've got a psychoanalysis oh
okay no psychoanalysis sorry do a
psychoanalysis
you know what give me some hints for
what direction i might go in if i roll
the 96
is this is this for agatha uh
all right you trust dr clive implicitly
everything he says
you take as gospel i mean he's our best
hope right now
that's right that's what i've been
and since since i know that that that dr
hollister is you know this
brilliant psychoanalyst he's helped me a
lot i go all right
if holly likes him i get them too
no
you've done great so
uh yeah he'll i mean if you want to hear
about the awful things that he can
i mean first of all most people
want to just go right to the you know to
a shocker for something really terrible
but i'm here to tell you it's about
volume if you want to clear out a large
area
so one shoggeth doesn't do so much not
easy to control
but you get yourself 37 shan tank and
you've got yourself a minor army
and that can clear out a fairly
significant area let me tell you
are they easier to control well
no no sure they're going to destroy
everything in the area
but on the plus side most of what's in
the area is
evil so and then you'll be able to get
rid of them so we can do
our ritual correct yeah yeah so if
you summon those
so the summoning only works until
sunrise
well really until a a until the light of
the sun
sounds like he's thought this through
pretty well
oh i have spent a great deal of time
uh time of course being a mutable
concept to one such as me
but i have spent a great deal of time
thinking about
your problem of needing to clear out the
evil from this area
and you've done the reading i've done
the reading
i know the rituals i know several of the
spells that might control what i'm doing
and i feel like we've got a very good
chance
okay okay and any any of them that go
inside the pyramids
what's your what's your plan for
removing those
well shin tank or a little large to
go
in the in the pyramids
but you know there is uh
uh you've got that book about the dolls
yeah i have gotten it i haven't been
able to do the research yet though so i
need to have
so the dolls well let's see
think of an earthworm right burrowing
through the ground now think of that
earthworm
the size of a train
okay that can take care of any sort of
subterranean activity that might be
with only right minor probably cosmetic
damage to whatever they go through
well if they're just going through dunes
well then it's fine
yeah all right so i'm gonna have to i'm
gonna have to sit down and and and
while we're you know getting things
ready we're getting
our message ready i'm gonna read the
book you know if
if you're worried about time i could
yeah yeah we did that once i've done
that once before
got into a head space where it was
really easy to to to read things fast so
anyway
was this was this one of dr caffor's
things
or was this that is that there was
that other uh
that you said character yes yes
yes that's very interesting um
yes he had some he had some fine details
with
with time that we you know so so
i can make it so that every error that
pierces here is a day for you
and that might help you read but now
here's the problem
uh you're gonna lose track of time and
it's gonna feel like
normal time to you uh
and your body's gonna come
back suffering in
well it's not going to have eaten a
drink for several
probably days so i can't bring up
some bread with me or anything like that
or water no i've so i've tried that and
you you all you you're subsumed by the
book
is the problem right so you have all the
but it it's not
pleasant coming out of it that's all i'm
going to say you know
but we got dr holly here doctor you
could help me right he did a bang-up job
on egypt didn't he
yeah no you got her so she can at least
function
right yes we've we've we've definitely
ascertained that the black pharaoh is
coming
so holly what do you think crackhead if
i go for a couple days my time
couple hours your time one one day at a
time
don't don't do any more than a day at a
time and i'd like to
i'd like to monitor you afterwards
before you try again
and make sure to hydrate and eat in
advance of course
okay that makes sense so i'll i'll have
some eat some some water
all right and and and bread and things
i i had one thought don't have the curry
though
i have some we have some something i
could wrap around me i mean
we've got help give me uh
i i think i think just a robe i'll wrap
a robe around me i'll be okay
so again this is a very disorienting
experience i just i want to stress that
i think it needs to be done i need to
know what's going on if this is
something that we really need to
to use right now for this
we do have a couple days but like i
don't know how long it'll take this
okay give it a go well then all right
professor you ready
no she hasn't she hasn't hydrated or
eaten yet
all right i'll be i'll be back then
one hour one hour one hour sir
all right okay uh
so we cut back in the hotel
uh it is now the morning
of june 2nd
yeah what are you doing i guess we're
waiting
yeah where's some money get
asked for money get money who are you
asking
um so you can also you i mean
given your credit rating you could just
go to the bank and
you know essentially write yourself a
check for cash
yeah i was able to say let's however
however like i'm gonna probably have to
ask the bank
bank person that helped me figure this
out because i would want a cash
against
our jackson elias money oh that is
harder
yeah yeah reimbursed for that that's all
reimbursements yeah the reimburse that's
the hard part is that you don't have
access to that account
um and you don't have it it would be a
letter of credit or something
if you had that but carlton ramsey
was not dumb enough to
silvano tried but he was not dumb enough
to to to give you that
um we have not been saving receipts
we're not getting reimbursed for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
man
um and so so yeah that is i mean
that is definitely a challenge you can
you can um
you know you can get your own personal
funds no problem
um essentially the bank will this is
why bank fraud was so much fun in the
early days because you could just be
like i seem wealthy
i probably have the money in my account
and you know they couldn't exactly
you know they would wire the bank and
hope that they heard back that you had
money
what yeah i was like don't give me
those ideas right now
i was gonna say it was so much easier
back then emma
i know because i could
like i mean where did do i know where
silvano like kept all the money if you
will
i mean bonner didn't keep the money he
kept yeah he kept the receipts there was
no
but then he asked for money and
reimbursement so like i'm assuming at
some point we were hopefully if he was
smart enough he was forward bankrolling
us with receipts
he had not submitted any paid like you
found all his paperwork
you know we could we could we could do
like a bulk submission at some point
it just got a lot of money i will give
you that silvano
set up like everything through your
first
trip to england not the disastrous
return to england but the first trip to
england
like he has everything set up that you
could probably mail off no problem
what now you said first trip to england
is that what you meant
yeah oh boy wow that's a ways back
yeah well silvano didn't go much farther
you know
okay so then i'm going to see if i can
get some wired funds from
the i forgot his name all of a sudden
oh roger rogers um
we we had some funds emma we had a large
bank roll that hollister returned to the
u.s government just a few days ago
we all have the same just like head
shaking eye roll reaction
why
um okay so i'm gonna do two things i'm
gonna see if i can get money
all right you send a telegram to rogers
asking for money
okay exactly and then i send the res
whatever the receipts that we had from
whatever i can find to carlton right so
yeah you'll send
uh you'll you'll send that off and
you'll get you know you'll get a chunk
of change
there was no like when he sends them
when he quote unquote when carlton
ramsey sends the money does it go to an
account or does it like
yeah it'll go to an account okay his
account do we know
uh you have access yeah he he gave you
an account number for that
okay and there's that's what i'm saying
is that there was nothing in that
account anymore
okay there was nothing in that account
because it you
you haven't submitted any reimbursements
okay so i'll do those things and see if
carlton ramsey is going to give us any
money
so you send that off all right and and
uh savannah made it
quite a ways he made it all the way to
china so he there's receipts for going
there's receipts through well but
your
your trip to china was accelerated
there's that so so yeah all of
he his receipts are all set up to
for the first trip to through the
first trip to england
[Music]
which i don't believe you destroyed any
hotels so
there's that wait
i think the only hotel that we've
actually destroyed quote-unquote was the
one in egypt with the the fire and
knight of chris
and cairo you've done a number on a
hotel yeah
cairo we've you could have just stopped
it
we're on cairo we've done a number on
not a bad episode title out and then i'm
like i poke donald i would be like see
if we could change over some of those
those silver dollars yeah
yeah sure you can actually get yeah you
can get you have about
five hundred dollars worth of silver
dollars
in local currency while we're yeah
uh um
what is the currency in egypt well the
problem is it was the pound
but now that i kicked the english out of
transfer it over to american dollars
they're a little more stable
yeah well let's work with spend here
in the current environment interesting
question
it always spends better the dollar the
dollar has spent everywhere you've
needed it to
yeah and theoretically yes i
i don't think that riots
i say this but i i don't think that the
localized riots are going to change the
overall economic structure the war is
much more likely to do that
money is money right yes i'll see if
that's a the bank has a
they'll exchange it for us dollars then
if that's
so i guess
huh it's currently the egyptian pound
um they're going to in in my new
egyptian arabic republic they're
going to have the kopec
so let's get a little bit of local
currency but let's keep us dollars
instead because you know what
god knows what's going to happen
tomorrow and the day after american
money
if everything goes well we are out of
here in a couple of days
well let's hope everything goes well
knock on wood
uh so it sounds like you guys aren't
doing much except
for today basically waiting to see if we
get any news
because we're waiting on telegrams for
wrought from roger we're waiting for to
see if our friends
turn up we're waiting to hear from there
it's not responded to
here's the situation telegrams before
let's try and also book passage to
shore you can you get a boat that you're
you know that will fit you and all of
your
well the whole point of of of getting in
touch with nearest was to get
was to get passage what was it was to
get basically teleported there
she uses whatever you you don't think
that teleporting a church crowd is a
good idea
but she did ask how how many people we
needed transported and we said about 16
people and she said that was fine
and you said they were he said that was
fine will this
mean people say that's fine oh well but
i thought you said that they were going
to meet me in dashore not
we didn't have to take them right that's
what you told them
so they're i mean oh so
they have to get their own vote of
course all right it is a it it's
all right they'll they'll make their
way to north shore
um so yeah you um
that it sounds like that's most of today
then is sort of waiting and getting
stuff set up and
resting up if any of you have taken if
any of the three of you have taken
damage
you'll get two hit points back
because you're just resting
not in a while i don't yeah i'm actually
all right
all right yeah i just don't need to
sit there using using a wet stone and
sharpening daggers i'm sure the noise
gets on everyone's nerves after a while
uh okay we'll we'll come back
to dashur and
um you have a large lots of bread
you carboload you know you have a hearty
meal
and drink some water and um
uh clive says all right you ready ready
your vision expanded i'm ready the
concept of time completely deconstructed
i said i was ready
well all right and he just touches your
forehead
and all of a sudden you are just it
feels completely normal to you you are
reading this book hollister he
touches her forehead
and she immediately just starts going
like
i can't tell i promise you she is
getting every bit in there i've
i've done that now i think she's
gonna find
that an hour is just enough to get
started in the book you really
it takes weeks to really dive into these
treatises in the right way
especially you know after the first
reading you start to notice the little
details that you didn't see before
like most people don't realize the
intense
homoerotic metaphors that go all through
the necronomicon
well she's not reading that
huh i heard each person's experience
with it never mind
never mind so are your men have your men
uh come back
uh i'll check old [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
uh so he yeah he'll head off all right
i'll uh
you're just gonna watch agatha this is
wrench but i'm getting stuff ready for
having to disagree with someone so an
hour passes joan make me an arabic
zero six boom all right so
books and you're gonna gain
uh now um
on 57
so that's intelligence yes that's that's
hard
okay you feel as if
you feel as if something is holding you
back
from truly being open to this experience
so you you get the three you get the
seven cthulhu mythos
you you lose the three sanity but you
feel like something
is some bit of self-restraint
some bit of control or or something like
that
is keeping you from like internalizing
maybe if you study the book for more
time yeah i think i need i need another
hour
so you come out and you've been awake
for 24 hours straight
you've not eaten you haven't drank you
haven't done anything for 24 hours
um and and it's almost literally like it
stops
oh i i think i need to do like a little
jog around a little jog around get my
everything growing
getting again can i do it no sit down
sit down no i get like getting her a cup
of tea or something
look the first time is very disorienting
i need more i need more i need more time
i need more you're going to you're going
to drop out if you pass out it's no good
i'm not going to pass out it's just it's
just it's not a day
i've i've i've done i've done a lot of
history reading i've done a lot of cons
concentrated things especially on on
things like this this is this is this is
epic
i've got to figure this out i did pass
out you hear me
passing out is a very very confusing
now it'll be better for you because i'm
setting the duration for what you're
doing
uh i had set the duration for myself and
then i passed out
and it was all very crazy i've got you
guys here
watching sleeping for four days yeah
yeah see i've got you
and i've got holly i've got you guys up
you've got my back
i've got and we're having your back by
making you sit
down rest for a little bit drink and eat
clean up yeah i'll do that well
i've got exciting news we've got a
spider
i am i took the liberty of creating the
spider away from you because it's a very
disconcerting experience
but we don't know where the tunnel goes
right no the spider this spider makes a
portal
right but we don't know where the portal
goes just to to find them right or are
we going to them
we would try our hotel rooms you said
you wanted to go to the military base
that's where they were no they didn't no
they got it
no they did go back to the military
basically we didn't get a hotel room
sorry it's been earlier you guys were in
the sinks
okay yeah we've been so yeah i mean like
i said
we can tell this spider
take us to the miller dwell i don't want
to go you know
but you can go to the military base the
portal will remain open
cool so you can travel back well let me
rephrase that
the portal will remain open for a
substantial amount of time
you said a couple hours yeah often
that's fine
i mean don't like don't make the spider
angry
don't you know don't i don't know don't
don't touch it really very temperamental
hmm selling us on the spider
well i've gotta read the book are you
i don't see a way out of it or i would
object
so you're going back two hours three
hours
four hours five can we narrow this down
well normally i've found yeah it's two
to three hours
so so yeah it should be qui quick to go
see them and get them and bring them
i'll be i'll be i'll clean up a little
bit and and then i'll i'm going to read
some more books
know that if you don't sleep for three
days
your brain will start breaking down
that's why we're only gonna do one more
right one more one more one more
one more right way too much
i mean i'd say don't do anything that i
wouldn't do
do your best all right all right we're
carb loading
um right you eat
go to the bathroom do all that stuff all
take care of him
up by the truck that was exactly my look
like yeah take care of that could be
like the the doctor way of doing it
thomas
um and he will he'll come up with
you and he's
and he says like so the spider is in the
okay i'm gonna make a
i don't know if i want to
[Music]
you might not i mean i'm more trying to
prepare myself for what i'm going to see
did you just fumble again yeah
all right i trust him implicitly if
that's what you're asking
everything yeah everything this man does
is
he is on the up and up gold he did not
just abduct
some kid and turn them into a spider no
no he didn't use one of his own henchmen
and turn it into a spider like you
totally don't see
as he comes back to the back of the of
the thing his other
five henchmen are like kind of like
backing away from him you don't even
notice it
okay but yeah i'm more just like
okay you're gonna see something just you
know what and with that fumble
you you you you see the spider and you
are
you're like okay that's you know you
have
you've prepared yourself for it and he
says so you just step through there
and you're gonna be in the military base
and you'll see the spider on the other
side
somehow not really sure how they
simultaneously exist
although they kind of also don't exist
here
i'm not trying to understand that yeah
it's probably for me on both sides
i'm walking through a spider right all
right now i step through
the spider so you step through and we'll
deal with you in a little bit
uh professor lam he comes back and he
says
all right how long am i putting under
full one more
hour come on one hour
i think it's got to be at least look
your friend for at least right
hours right right right holly's gone for
two so yeah put me in for two
and then when he comes back everything
will be great he said don't go more than
three so i've gone one
i ate so now i'm only going two yeah i
mean i'm sure that restarted the counter
yeah cause i ate and i drank and i went
to the bathroom
of course all right all right so
three it is then no no two two two two
two two the counter restarted right but
he said if i go three then i'll be in
trouble so i need two
no he he meant if he got more than three
three is the threshold you go up to
three everything's fine
more than three yeah all right then
there's start to be some associated
co-morbidities
i mean i'm not a doctor but yeah i was
going to say you know what
what's your persuasion
[Laughter]
um yeah people don't have persuasion
yeah no i've already
i've already lost a little bit of sanity
and stuff so i'm i'm down with this guy
all right so three it is
three it is yeah all right i mean if you
go four your mind might be open to
vistas you never before experience yeah
but then holly will
chew us both out and i don't want that
well tell ya the first time
that i went five i met someone from
pluto
it was a bug put my brain in a jar took
me to pluto
whoa yeah let me tell you
you wouldn't know either right here
cut the head right here took my brain
out put it in a jar
yeah but i you know i don't want to push
it i don't want to be gone when he gets
back do you know what i mean
if i'm in a pluto head jar thing that
would be bad i'm going to be here when
he gets back
well i mean your body would be here
right three we'll do three right
three we got three it is you're the
bulls all right
thank you thank you for that clive
i'm here to i'm just here to help
i want i want nothing but the success of
all right yeah all right let's go
everything evil around there
you're gonna put the kip stone back on
and that will get rid of that black
pharaoh
all right let's go all right he taps you
on the
on the head and you are back in there uh
and
um so you step through the spider
and you're covered in spiders
[Laughter]
that's how spider portals work and um
you step out behind a building
on the military base so you're like away
from things
you hear do you speak arabic dr
hollister
i do not okay you hear some very
can i peak around a corner very subtly
are they it seems like most of the
american soldiers are very focused
on the front of the camp
okay i'm gonna run towards the back and
try and uh
catch someone okay yeah you'll find uh
there's a there's a soldier
yeah and i don't remember the name of
the lieutenant we were talking to but uh
can you can you direct me to lieutenant
such-and-such
it was did i i think i wrote it down for
a rare thing
oh i might have written it down too but
you know what
no apparently not why would i do that uh
yeah oh you want to talk to the ceo he's
well he's a little busy with the riot
i i came here a couple days ago with
some some companions are they still here
um i'm gonna i'm gonna go to
where i would send a telegram okay
yeah there is a communications tent
um and uh
um sir if you want to send any
communications
and then you drop like your military
you've got you're a military guy so you
drop your thing and he's like oh of
course sir
yeah and i send rogers a message to
send a message
to them wherever they might be saying
you know i lost contact with them
i won't say anything about suspecting
that they started riots
um yeah and i'll tell them
uh i'll tell them location and i'll give
them a
a window of time 24 hours from now
in dashore or what location are you
telling them on the army base
okay if if they can if they can get
there
um i because i don't have another
location where i
i think i could safely give them or or
that he could get the spider to i'm
hoping he can get it at the same spot or
even if it's just close i can pop out
run to that spot and grab them okay yeah
oh yeah you passed that you you asked
rodgers to pass that message along
um are you saying anything else in
the message to rogers
um yeah that uh
professor lam and i have made our way to
dashore we
have some confidence in our ability to
clear the area
of evil but we we don't think we have
okay and yeah i'll i'll leave it at that
all right
and run back to the spider portal all
right um
all right yeah nobody nobody has
stumbled upon the spider portal
uh and and before i hop in i'll look
around to see if there's
any less conspicuous places just off the
top of my head
um this is this is pretty good you're
like at the back
of the base behind a building
so it seems like you know
i mean is the spider aware
who knows but it seems like the spider
specifically went to an inconspicuous
place
okay okay and you know what as long
as i pop through and it gets closed and
the next time if they're there
won't be a problem okay yeah you come
through
and you come through and the
portal closes behind you
and i'm not going to turn around
i'm consciously not going because the
thump's behind me yes
yes spider's sleeping i get out of the
truck
all right i know it's a lie
it wouldn't i don't need to see a body
right now all right you you hang out
up upstate yeah that's right yeah i know
that i'm lying to myself i'm fully aware
but as long as i don't see it that's for
the best
sure yeah so you you you you jump out
of the truck
vigorously and um
joan is sitting at the table still just
like
oh and is it where's where's clive do
i see him in here live is like lying on
a cot
asleep okay i'll
uh then i'll i'll spend my time seeing
if i can get
anything any nutrients into agatha
okay yeah her situation and try
talking to her some more
all right you you spend you spend a
little more time
uh with agatha and um
uh
um she doesn't seem to be her condition
um yeah i mean no it's the same thing as
with the body in the back i know that
what i'm doing isn't going to work but
i'm just
trying all right so
the night of the second for you in the
hotel
you have a lovely dinner you're you're
all kind of frustrated because you're
sort of spinning your wheels there's
nothing to do
um are you doing anything that night
yeah maybe just hanging out having
telling stories having conversations
sure i promise we're leaving tomorrow
have we seen any cuts at all any news
from the cops
uh not yet not yet but
i mean i'm sure i would have heard by
now if she was displeased by the
offering
cats do not hesitate to make their
displeasure known
well do we need to leave tomorrow well
that's that's the question we need to be
there
probably by the fifth so your people are
theoretically arriving the fifth
right so we should force
probably the best idea is going to be
spending tomorrow
gathering supplies for camping in the
desert for a couple of days
one thing you should be mindful of
whatever it is that that australian
fellow is doing i don't think we want to
be there when it happens
i would very much prefer to not be there
yes
so we arrived the last they're not the
last minutes but you're right
the day before i mean assuming that he
made it there
we don't know we don't know travel
through portals
into the locked libraries and whatnot i
think that
transportation is not a problem for him
i mean unless he was
knocked unconscious and taken prisoner
by someone working for the army of the
perhaps but i think we'd see some
evidence of that the bloody
mess more than what we saw i just
i pardoned me for breaking the the
stream here but i just saw that my buddy
tossy was in the uh
was in the in the crowd so uh
everybody you know take a take some time
to go and
uh watch tossy stream he's he's i
don't watch people play video games but
i will watch tossy do just about
anything he's fine he's one of the
he's one of the folks that someday i
will play gloomhaven with again
uh someday soon we will play but
uh tossy great great seeing you thanks
so much for joining us that is that is
awesome
missy betting the um
so when you go to sleep
um let's see
each of you make me a pal roll yay
critical success for me all right who
made the best
i mean who got the so who got a normal
success
all right so you two
um very faintly
let's see emma you know well you both
know
um thanks to the weird way our world
works you both know the voice
of well actually no emma you know the
voice of professor aldridge
yes you very faintly hear aldridge's
voice
in your dreams saying let me in
let me in no
and as soon as you say no you don't hear
okay
i mean you know how you're dreaming and
you will yourself to wake up that's
exactly what i did is i willed myself to
be like
no and then wake up yeah um
donald you hear a female voice that you
sort of recognize saying let me in
let me in yeah yeah i
probably wouldn't pay that much paid
much mind all right yeah you just so
you have a weird dream that is just you
over and over hearing that over and over
again and it's almost hypnotic
maybe at some point i'll wake up and do
because that's yeah okay yeah
yeah you'll you'll wake up we just
got
raided by fateful encounters okay
welcome fateful encounters thanks
so much for joining us we are playing
call of cthulhu
let's see right now one person is in
a time warp reading books at
you know some 24 times the the normal
time
um one person is uh
trying to keep a fortune a person who
can see the future alive
uh and the other two two of them are
getting messages in their dreams that
they're refusing to hear
and one of them just refused to hear the
message in their dreams outright
uh that's about where we are that uh
so thanks for the raid
thanks for joining us now i feel like
i have to and you missed the sphinx
coming alive and killing a bunch of
people
it was as things says do if i'd known
you were coming i would have saved that
for y'all
um so yeah you both you emma and donald
you definitely wake up um
no feeling like you know there was that
voice in your head
alexander you you don't i'm also angry
that i've been woken up
yeah well yes of course to that
um so so that
that is cairo back to joshua joan
after your two two days you come out and
yes 25. all right yeah you i mean
you didn't you don't feel great but you
don't you know you didn't take any
serious damage and
come on no i didn't make it
all right so barely just barely since
do you want me i think that's actually a
good thing because last time her
intelligence making the intelligence
role meant that she couldn't get what
was going on in the book
i mean so you now you have looked at
this book and and you've spent two days
studying it
and and you have learned the spell
summon dhole d-h-o-l-e
is what you're saying right you lose
i'm gonna go old-school cthulhu here and
you're gonna get
giant worms oh no it's like
i have i have the market on that one
yeah that's you you
of time ending you are terrified of
running out of time
you are very aware how finite
okay so that means i'm going to talk a
lot faster now too
that probably i get that needle that i
had for sedating
i want to be sedated yeah okay um
i was gonna go maura hamilton you write
like you're running out of time
there you go there you go and so yeah
you come out of it
and a you've learned this incredible
knowledge
and b you're aware of like how much time
that took
and you know there's the world may end
in what is it six months now five months
uh and at the very least you're gonna be
dead in what 40 years
you know there's just there's no time
there's none no time at all no time at
all i gotta find everything do
everything come on guys
let's get this together now i can't go
anywhere
i like where your head's at time
is the most important resource we have
so but but things have to be on
time we have to wait we have to wait for
the right day to do the the
the i can't even speak anymore i'm just
look it's it's gonna be it's not gonna
be a pleasant ritual
but i think i could make it the day we
need it to be
but then we lose time oh i could
no no no everything will just come it'll
just be right
no because we have today we should be we
should be making preparation we should
be
uh scouting we can't just throw that
away
and besides we're we're waiting on the
others to show up i sent them a message
i couldn't find them tomorrow at this
tomorrow at the same time uh
i'm gonna tell them to be where the last
spider was
your current what can we do before that
what could we do what kind of things do
we have to get before then
i'm sure they'll be there we just have
to sacrifice one more person to make it
happen
it'll all be worth it well actually
just to be clear
for the ritual that i we're gonna use to
move time ahead to the day
it's more than one person well no we're
not gonna do that
yeah yes yes yes yes value value
everything has value at time
time we don't have any time guys we got
to get this stuff done what else we got
to do now what else do we have to do now
well we have to wait a day no
no no you should be able to no
oh can i sleep for two hours
sure i will do it right no
wake back up given you that you've been
out for two days oh but clive you can
wake me back up right that's that's
that's
one of the other things right no come on
come on
yeah no no no he can't he if he could
put me out for two days he can wake me
up in two days that would be
great right oh i could go back and i
could
sleep here yeah here hit me in the head
again and i'll and i can sleep for two
days in an hour
pulling the book away if that's
happening
why did i never think of that here's a
fantastic idea
isn't that cool then you could sleep two
days and it's like you've slept for an
entire day
yes it's not good to okay i'm gonna try
it i'm gonna go
i'm gonna i'm gonna lie down in bed i'm
gonna lie down in bed and i'm gonna curl
up and then
and then i'm gonna sleep for two days
right no no not two days oh
no that doesn't work it doesn't work
she's gonna be asleep for two hours but
it's gonna feel like she's asleep for
two days
but that's not good that's not good for
well look i mean we can agree to
i'm walking out i'm walking out of the
room i'm just gonna
gets as you walk out of the room
you hear clive going just go to sleep
yeah that's right just go to sleep
sleep
i'm gonna try this you hear like a thud
and like clive is now asleep turbo
sleeping
i'm gonna never have to really sleep
again
it's gonna say something like they're
gonna lose their minds but lives way
ahead of the ball on that one
um okay
now i'm gonna i'm gonna do something
else to take my mind off of
today's events all right um
yeah you can spend some time you know
taking care of agatha
um again all she's doing is
writing again and again the black
pharaoh is coming
he's a good listener you know what you
gain a sanity
as you spend the rest of the evening
just being like let me tell you about my
life
and you start to understand like how
useful it is when you do that for other
people
i'm gonna and i'm gonna you know i'm
gonna whatever i can scavenge to make
like a halfway decent meal i'm gonna do
something nice for myself
i like it yeah the four guys will
share their me
the the four the five henchmen sorry
will will like share their meal with you
okay yeah i mean if again if i can make
anything to share with them of course
so about an hour after you do that
you hear clive going i
feel great you just think you feel great
but that's what feeling great is oh i
said that under my throat thinking you
i'm fairly certain i can see
every blade of grass in a field
do you need another spider he comes in
your room
whoa we just got raided again the d-a-t
network is rating us with 31 of our
closest friends
thank you network we
are we are playing call of cthulhu and
they've met a
very insane australian yeah but we we
will need another
we'll need another spider the message
i gave was to be there at the exact same
time
do you know if the portal will be in the
same place hold on i'm gonna make an
english role for the henchmen
so when you when you say we're gonna
need another a spider
clive says well that's outstanding i
can't wait
and now that the henchmen are all like
i'll go out with them this time
to help them find a cultist
well all right but you know if you can't
find somebody well you know any part in
a storm
in about an hour professor liam's
gonna wake up and i can tell you
from personal experience she is gonna
feel
fantastic
look i'm not a scientist but she's
probably gonna feel
you know this may sound crazy but i
think
i can see every blade of grass in a
field
yeah you mentioned you mentioned that i
have to go find a field
i'll be back you know i mean if there's
no blades of grass you can always use
sand
wow i think there's a good amount of
that out there you've just expended my
horizons friend
i wonder if i can see an individual
i'll have to go he hands that he heads
out
very excited so you go out with
uh two of the henchmen one of the
henchmen
yeah he'll in english he'll say to
you
you should leave he's crazy
yes i know that much but
we're in a corner right now we need him
he's
he he'll he'll do he might do to you
what he does to
i don't want to ask what did he do to a
med
so yeah we're gonna need to find someone
else
for that i mean we we have to we need to
get the rest of
we need to get mike we have to do the
i i don't know i don't know another way
all right well we'll
let's let's find someone that isn't us
that we can turn into a spider
well let's let's let's aim for someone
who
is a cultist of the black pharaoh and
um i i would prefer
great if we find a cultist outstanding
let's aim for that
i will not be asking for inspiration
that's a 13. outstanding yeah so you
guys waylay
a cultist and they're very excited
uh they're very careful not to injure
they just they knock him unconscious but
they're clearly not trying you know
they're like
as long as he's not bleeding it's fine
and they will drag him back back
to the thing
um that takes about an hour and
um clive is standing over professor lam
and he's like 17 16
12 and you wake up
i feel i know
right i see
oh i bet you i could see individual
grains of sand
let's go count them now these are
there's really a lot of them
but yes they're there for us
i know that a sixth reading of the
necronomicon
to the front just do it let's just do it
let's just give me the book give me the
book
so so you learned you already learned
the spell you learned the spell already
i i i learned how to summon the d-hole
okay and now you just need
just just to be clear d-hole
sounds rude it's a dhole oh dull
door like like like the the fruit i
i'll tell you i called one a d hall once
and it didn't go well for me but you're
still here they don't really understand
english or language is a construct but
they're a little touchy about their own
name
no so do these need to be bound as well
you summon in the new bind
well look if you're going to summon
anything you're going to want to bind it
okay and so she just needs to learn the
binding
i'm sure cool where's the binding
i mean you got to read the book right
one please don't don't eat or anything
why because you've been out of time for
two days
you guys have seen the cookie monster
eat right
yeah you eat you eat like three days
worth of food you are st
as soon as food is in front of you you
are starving i feel like i have to do a
psa for anyone who ever learns how to
control time
it would not work like this this would
ruin you this would wreck you
so hard oh no it is ruining like
i mean you know just out of game this
guy's quite insane
there's a reason that like he can cast
spells left right and center because he
doesn't have to worry about sand loss
but joan you will you sure yeah
is going on us away
going away so bye bye joan so two how
well i i i i think i've eaten enough
i'll just wrap this up around me and
then you won't be able to read
the the words in the book will be
melting
in front of you you won't be reading
them anymore your brain won't let you
no i laser i have no it doesn't work
like that
focus that's not how does light be in
focus
yeah our lights don't come out of our
eyes
none of this is are you you
you all i'm hearing is a lot of what you
can't do yeah
yeah what is this holly you're supposed
to be the guy who tells me who tells me
who gets me lifts me up and helps me go
come on
you can do it two days you can do two
days two more days two more days two
more days let's go let's go
let me just get set up here okay got
myself my necronomicon you've got your
oh my god he touches your forehead
and you are in again um
and then he says would you do me a favor
i'm about to put myself
under and all i'm gonna need is
for you
have you even oh yeah yeah
i i so all i'm gonna need for you
is to take my finger off my forehead and
just put it in the book
what i'm just going to need for you
to take my finger off my forehead where
it will be
stuck because of a mild temporal
distortion
and put it on the book okay is there
like a stick
somewhere yeah you can find a stick sure
okay
so he touches himself on his forehead
and he freezes like this
and then i take a stick and try and move
his finger to the right yeah you
you very roughly slide it down to the
book and then he immediately is just
like
uh and both of them it's like stereo
like the weird sound
um i'm not staying in this room
[Laughter]
um the so
the cultist is woken up and the four
guys are like have him tied to a chair
and he's gagged right oh yeah okay and
one of the
um one of the guys is when when do we
need to
have this ready
are we still on the day that i went
through the portal this is yeah the
evening of the second
oh yeah so it'll be tomorrow and how
long
it took him like an hour to do the
ritual right
yeah so then buffer in a half hour just
amount of grace time
he'll want to start at about that time
to meet the time that i expect them
to be at that army base just to just
to
just to warn you when he goes like that
he usually passes out
afterwards well he can he he's going to
sleep through the night right
oh he passes out from doing the the
spider
no the time thing oh yeah that's good
okay i hope that he does
okay that that that that's fine
so we come back to the hotel and it
is the morning
of june whoops there goes my pen
it is the morning of june 3rd
and emma and donal you both wake up
with that memory of that dream
um you know it was alexandra's it was
dr aldridge's voice
donald you don't it was a voice you kind
this bloody annoying dream all night
there's some woman
pestering me answer some phone call or
something
i like how you say it was bloody
annoying that a woman was pestering you
in your dreams
okay good questions about you sir but
whatever
as long as i wasn't the one being as
long as i wasn't the one being bloody
annoying in your dreams
your voice is somebody else i don't i
don't even recall them what
sounded familiar but i can't place it
i need some coffee that's like a
personal problem
so you guys are you're you're mainly
doing supplies and stuff today
yeah gather gathering supplies like a
couple of
anything that we can get to make camping
in the desert for a couple of days a
little bit more comfortable
so it sounds like you are planning on
um you're hoping you're going to like
somehow teleport there
and yes because we can because that's
what we'd arranged with narrows
right so you're not really sure what
kind of cargo capacity you're going to
have
right so i'm i'm trying to pack down
small enough that i can carry it in a
backpack on my back okay
um sure with with let's say
200 of the 500 that you had you can
easily get the three of you
fully kitted out with you know um
light portable uh
good camping good clothes a good
desert gear that sort of thing
and then we want to get emma's hearty
invitees
some some snacks as well right yeah
we do
we have to put out a party spread so i
mean you're not sure
like you're gonna have to carry whatever
this is because you're not getting a
truck
or a boat no so you can't just buy like
a cr
you know crates of food i mean we
we could buy we could get up to like
three crates of food as long as we're
all able to carry it
sure get some camels or something while
we're down there
i have no idea how big this portal is or
how long it'll be open
so camos are probably not a great idea
um alexandra make me an
intelligence role oh good
yep so you said portal
uh there's been no discussion of
portals you don't know
how she's getting us there that's true
yeah
i don't mention that where it's like i
i've i've been using the term portal
because that's
how we've been doing a lot of transport
back and forth but i have no idea how
we're doing this or what the
capacity of it is maybe she has some
tunnels or something but that requires
time
to move from one place to another it
does
i mean you have heard stories about all
the tunnels and and we know someone
no she hasn't no maybe we should make
our way there
i mean you know you know you know
exactly where the uh
where the temple is that is absolutely
true
and the last time we were there we
killed two people
i'd like to not be in the same spot
again where someone will almost
certainly recognize donald and me
that sounds like a recipe for a terrible
idea
we had no cats visiting us last night i
take it not that i've seen
and i'll and i i think that when we're
getting the supplies i would range
toward the edge of the international
quarter to try and find not like step
into old cairo necessarily unless i see
a cat and i like step in quickly to talk
to it and come back
so you know that most of the cats are
out at night sure
oh boy i hate to say it we
we may need to make plans right yeah i
wait okay contact all right if we don't
hear from her
by tomorrow we we we take a ferry down
because we have to sleep tomorrow right
we live on the fourth regardless
yeah all right very well
uh so yeah you'll spend the day getting
outfitted and all this stuff looking for
cats
um studiously avoiding the old quarter
um
professor lam you come out of two hours
of days
uh and you notice that um
clive is still going
it
yes okay so
you you you you feel like you're again
you feel like your brain was
dancing around learning whatever ritual
you were trying to learn
and and you feel like
like almost like every time you feel
like you're about to make a breakthrough
uh you could hear hollister's voice
going
that's dangerous don't do that your
brain's gonna shut down
and an hour passes
and and you're you're like eating
like crazy and doing all this stuff
i got cleaned up and clive is still
in there
he's still reading oh man i'm gonna try
i'm gonna see if i can get him to come
out because we got talk
so you're gonna like shake him yes all
right
uh all right you shake him and he starts
i think i just oh nope
all right something is terribly wrong
with clive
i just tried to make him up i just tried
to wake him up i tried to wake him up
because he was he in the speech
did you try to i tried to wake him up
i didn't do it again i just was sh am i
you know you know hollister we can uh
inspire that role just throwing that out
there you know what though
should justin i'm just gonna sedate him
all right yeah
hollister just walks up and bam
oh god what does sedation do to a
massive heart attack
um nothing good i'm gonna make uh
just make a roll and see what happens
wow oh seven um
so you sedate him and
he just goes like he goes from like oh
it's a bam his head just hits the
table and he is out he's see
does it he looked like he was acting in
real time
yes i'm going to try taking his pulse
all right
so and that's why he's sedated
yeah that's good that's a good sign okay
all right so you just you you gave him
something to knock him out that was it
and then now he's knocked out and so but
i needed him don
dolly get him up get him up we need to
we need to go
oh no if i put his if i put stimulants
in him he'll die
well then then then don't mess with him
how am i supposed to do anything else
with that thank you because he's he
needs to come here and you're going to
talk to me no so so so
they were telling me that when he does
what he does
he he he passes out instantly like he
was putting himself under tremendous
stress
okay how but i'm here and see i'm awake
and why can't he be awake
i thought we went to the same time i did
a shorter time for you
oh that guy oh my god i'm just gonna
have to give him a hard hard time when
he wakes up he wakes up when he wakes up
he wakes up um
are you are you sedating joan she
probably won't notice
i mean if she i mean i'll i'll do some
i'll do something to him i'll you go in
like this and come over to holly and be
like
but i've got to get this i've got to get
this done we've got to get this done
it's going to be in time
yeah oh this is for your own good
all right yeah so you pass out from
the sedation
i don't know i like clive too much i
can't kill him uh
so yeah i think that is where we're
gonna end things for tonight
uh it is it is that time um
thank you so much to the two groups that
rated us the
the d-a-t fam and
oh gosh what was the other one something
oh gosh i'm old i can't remember but
thank you very much to the two groups
that readed us that was awesome
uh thank you players that was that
was a that was big fun
let's see our quotes for tonight um
mankind that word should have a new
meeting uh
we always have a backup place he's
trying to not start a war
i explicitly didn't want to know what
happened
ah a justice not a mercy i love that
quote it's not safe out there and
it's not safe in here
oh that's not great timing it's a shame
about the sphinx
good a good old-fashioned old testament
bloodletting
what did i miss that one you missed that
that's all you emma i only have larger
bills i love that
um not safe here anymore anymore uh
not safe here anymore is a wide umbrella
no bodies no blood they're fine
you have ether i also have class
that's good we've done a number on cairo
we may need to make multiple plans and
don't mess with him outside of time
i don't know what do you think is the
title i really like i explicitly didn't
want to know what happened
yeah that's why that's my current leader
dude
that also feels very much like this
episode where i'm like you notice i
didn't ask what happened i just asked
what time do we have to leave and then
and then you went on and then proceeded
to ask exactly what happened because
circumstances demanded that you needed
to know yeah

you so much guys this was
this was a fun i i can't kill dr clive
i'm having too much fun doing them
uh and thank you to braden
who is the whole reason that clive is a
crazy australian
um and congratulations to braden for his
24-hour
call of cthulhu game i i tuned in
several times and at least once
somebody was napping i i i think one of
the one of the characters was dozing off
but um
that was that was a beautiful brand of
insanity
that's amazing they actually did it
that's what like it's
the 12-hour stream that we did on new
year's day was was killer enough as it
was i can't imagine playing call of
cthulhu for 24 hours that's just
yeah it was just i i'm hats off to them
and they
they they i want to say they almost
doubled their goal
i think it was 1.5 somewhere around
there um
it was 1.5 times their goal which is
fantastic and thomas says we're
actually when this is done we're going
to raid another charity stream so
wonderful stick around i guess
there's nothing left to say but goodbye
you
