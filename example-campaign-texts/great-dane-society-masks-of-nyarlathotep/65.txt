it's the morning of the 23rd
and you have the embassy staff
will do what they can to help you
uh hollister they have made it clear to
you that
um they don't know what delta green they
don't really know what delta green is
they've just been told to help you
um and told them i haven't told them the
words delta green
right sorry they don't know what you you
know they don't know you're just a
government employee to them and they've
been told to
assist you as they can you um
you haven't heard back from rogers yet
you sent him a message but
you you know that um
the situation the the political
situation with japan
for the united states is fraught right
now yeah
we're gonna have to i'm keeping a very
close eye on these plans
i'm not leaving the embassy and i'm
trying to work with them to figure out
should he not respond the most secure
way to get these
uh to him so i suppose the question is
what
what do we want to do i mean
alexandria's first
order of operations is get more daggers
or something approximating them
yeah i need a sword because they're
obviously not keen on explosives in this
town
actually that's you know alexandra i
have so you have often described what
you carry as like stilettos so do you
actually use
knives or daggers so what i use
are more daggers than than knives
they're about yay long
about about the length of my forearm
that they can be hidden under sleeves
and stuff like that but you have a sharp
on both sides
it's sharp on three sides actually
because stilettos are a triangle shaped
blade
yeah so i use them more for stabbing
than slashing but i
um the the the embassy staff thinks
that's a weird
question and they will point you to like
tourist you know like
um you know i got kitchen knives from
this guy
no no the good thing the the the good
weaponry
not cutlery you you're not sure who to
ask about that you know maybe
maybe if you get some japanese military
contacts they can say we could ask
ichiro
to hook us up yeah what's his name
but there's no there's no laws against
crowbars here is there
there are no laws against crowbars
there's not a lot of
not a lot of weapons you know people are
not carrying
uh swords or you know knives openly
poor donal stuff anyway so
yeah so yeah what is your plan for the
lovely morning
you know you have some breakfast at the
embassy
yeah he's insightful how do we get in
touch with taro i've
heard from rogers at all have you talked
to him at all hollister
no i haven't i've sent him messages
the diplomatic cable system you know
takes a while
because they it's essentially sent
through the department
the department of state and then there's
like three layers of coding
that go on and uncoding so
uh messages that are sent take longer
messages that are coming take longer
yeah well well the coming i'm less
worried about just because
i would tell him the mirror in my room
in times that i would be there
in local time i thought you had a
different way of talking with them so
well but it takes it takes a while to
get the information to him
and it it was not working terribly well
what do you mean almost like magic is
not reliable
yeah yeah that's funny that stuff works
huh wallace
we still we still need okay we need to
figure out where we we need to be
we still have time we've got plenty of
time well plenty is not the word for it
i mean theoretically you do need to be
on gray dragon island when there's a
full moon
to do the full ritual although
maybe just going in and killing a bunch
of people
and you know blowing stuff up might be
good enough
so that gives us a little less than two
weeks
or a month in two weeks yeah
do we have the thing that we need to
fill with blood to seal it
wasn't that the the the the buddha
statute
the
we can try to make one guess who has
that
no or we can yeah
that's ah right i need a gorilla to
fight a gorilla
let's go talk to flint thorn castle well
and i suppose that depends on whether or
not we think we can find him he's with
the japanese military isn't he or did we
learn something else that i've
forgotten you've been here the whole
africa
anyway so to find flint
can we get the american embassy to put
us in contact with the japanese embassy
which can put us in contact with the
japanese
soldiers that we could put us in cat in
contact with flint is that how that
works
i mean sort of theoretically yes doesn't
sound unreasonable
he's also a spy don't you just put an ad
in the paper the wanted ad
how do you turn a gorilla into a spy
he's too big
not toro oh taro sure yeah
carl he was he's a he's a he was a
spy but he was also a military man he
was definitely
you know part of the japanese uh
intelligence service
yeah we should look him up and see if he
can help us out
finding flinthorn castle yep
i think a wanted ad right there in the
uh the person
okay the one we do a two-pronged
approach dr hollister
you know people in the the whole
government thing so can you
start trying to do a government thing on
that
and then so then we can put something in
the paper if you guys want to
um i just want to point out tamagotora
had a line that
is very good i'm sure a couple months as
an immortal gorilla has really mellowed
madame lynn out
nope unlikely
oh she's going more crazy but that does
bring up a good point like
we should see what she's up to
surreptitiously like see if there's any
oh it sounds like making contact with
the intelligence service is
is just what you want to do exactly um
yeah what follows
is about a half day of bureaucracy uh
as you try and find the right person
to make you know the uh
the contact with and that sort of thing
and
um you you end up
um it turns out that in
certain circles the fact that there's a
thousand pound girl
you know a thousand pound gorilla
working with the japanese is pretty well
known and pretty obvious
and so you
you get information there is a
uh essentially a safe house for the
japanese government that has
uh that flint stays at
and he is you get that address
and you know you you head there in the
afternoon
and there are two japanese
and you know they
start to you know they're like wait
wait wait
and then flint will actually say it's
okay and
you notice that do any of you speak
japanese
no all right as near as you can tell
flint speaks very
very good japanese he he like speaks
to the guys
in japanese um
and you know he'll he'll bring you in
and he'll um
did you if you want to come nick
but i know you don't want to
you don't want to schizophrenia but
yeah and so so nick uh
flint has been working with the japanese
for not as many months as you think
actually
given all the zipping around i think
it's been about three months but
um and you've essentially worked into an
uneasy partnership that is
you know you kind of giving them mythos
information and stuff like that and
them pledging full support
for moving on grey dragon island
and both flint and the japanese
want to do this sooner rather than later
the japanese viewpoint and flint you can
decide if this is your viewpoint
but they have expressed several times um
that you know the longer the longer you
let things sit the worse they become
yeah but i'd keep reminding them the
last time they sent an entire destroyer
how it was handled
yeah and and they keep ominously saying
they won't
we're not sending just a destroyer this
time
well all right but they have they
have they have pledged their
their full support and you know you
have done
flint a good job of kind of deflecting
as they clearly try and get information
about
delta green and about like how the us is
using mythos stuff
but they clearly know something is up
there
and they're very interested in that but
you're not a prisoner or anything you've
been free to go
and to to move about as you as you know
as free as a
thousand pound gorilla is on the streets
of tokyo to to move about
um and you know you haven't been cut off
from communication or anything like that
um
do you tell taro by the way when they
show up do you want him to come to this
or
i think we'd like to see them all right
get closer yeah he'll be there kind of
late so you guys have time to talk
before then so
uh go ahead i'm i'm assuming he's still
my drinking buddy
oh yeah yeah taro is taro is seems like
or castle
great to see you again buddy
great to see all of you too i'm very
happy you're all still alive
yeah we are too surprised or happy
little both mostly mostly happy giving
what you all
tend to get into yes well not for lack
of trying
no you're not quite see us here in tokyo
all right yeah i was about to say
um what what brings you here where for
you fella
we gotta get to work for what i'm pretty
busy here trying to
get them ready for gray dragon island
we need to do that too we're pushing it
on that
do you have a plan of course not do we
ever
does it matter well last time it
mattered
no we figured that that we would get all
of the information together as best as
we could and then try to make a plan
from there
because trying to make a plan with not
um they i think they're a little
too eager to get to that island
um they're i think they're gravely
underestimating
i mean you were all there they didn't
just
they didn't just destroy the carrier
they completely disassembled it
down to the smallest piece if they want
to be indiscriminate
who knows what they're capable of so
what do you suggest mom
i don't understand well i've been
trying to
guide them into looking into uh
potential magics that they have here in
japan that may be
undiscovered that could be used oh yeah
being able to gather all the magic we
can
seems to be a good way to beat these
guys yeah
flint we had we actually had success in
egypt again
so we went back and we sealed the dark
pharaoh
into the bed pyramid we did it fantastic
once well that's all you need right
theoretically and a a priest fellow
who did the work for us
a lot of ways oh well
well i mean he's that's right yeah he's
in a tomb
so
a little bit but not enough to do
everything yeah we've got to
clear the area and then we need that
jade statue
of whatever it is that madame lynn has
and then we need to beat a drum
drain innocent blood into the statue
until what time dawn dusk i can't even
remember anymore
that's just paraphrasing that's that's
the that's the abridged version of what
needs to happen
right because we do have we have a chan
the chant you have to do the champ
and you need to yeah well we still
haven't solved the problem of
which one getting onto the island in one
piece
yes that's so we have all the rest of it
we have the chant
we have we don't have the statue we have
to get the receptacle yes
and then have you guys researched
stanford at all
because that might be a way to well i
don't know just spitballing here lure
him out
something get him away from the island
so that we can go on the island i don't
know
ezra have we figured out anything about
stanford so yeah what you know about
carl stanford is that he
is american he before
he somehow ended up in hofang's
employ he was
kind of a a get rich scheme
sort of guy he he would start
um he'd start like fake secret societies
and use them as like pyramid schemes and
things like that
there was let's see here let's
oh all right yeah the japanese got some
good intelligence for you
um and uh
they believe that he has
access he is the he somehow got
access to
some very advanced weaponry
and the japanese are very very
something i i didn't get a chance to ask
about
that i think i remember alexandria you
remember
the things that were on the beach
you you reacted to those vividly
yes kyra siri
all of a sudden remember those
yeah in the tank i remember the tank
tank
but the car siri siri are essentially
vampires
except they suck fat instead of blood
and
you can make some one out of someone by
getting a worm down down into their
stomachs
and how do you kill them i guess would
be sunlight apparently doesn't work
sunlight very much does not work it's um
remember correctly you just like
shoot them we just shot things that's
what we did they
were immortal okay no
no holy water or anything but they
weren't like you know
eternal or anything like that it's like
the tape worm from hell
right they were they were they were
strong certainly but not immortal
yes they were unpleasant
and difficult to kill but killable
and that's what all that matters i
recall we took some
we were there but i don't remember
us killing any of them so thank you
of course yeah i think there were some
explosions that got a bunch of them on
the island you know there were some uh
explosives thrown and that sort of thing
but
um i remember us throwing the i remember
throwing the explosive head that landed
well no landed on me that was chewing in
me and i threw that
and it was flash tank actually killed
some of them as well with them
i think i was i don't know how focused i
um it was something to focus on
but every time you think had a lot of my
attention i remember
being with the boats getting very aware
of yeah yeah
desperate to get a boat off of that yeah
and i do remember that the more people
that we lost to the island would become
they have to be changing the car syria
just be killed
so someone had to do that sanford i'm
assuming
i mean that's that's usually our
solution isn't it yeah
the work i wonder i suppose if
because it was penhue that took the
destroyer apart
when we were last out there a can
stanford do that
b can he do that to more than one ship
because we only took one ship out there
could he do that too three five
ten fifteen plus airplanes i don't know
the thing that has me worried is that he
he did it it wasn't stanford but it was
still done so deftly to one ship
that that a lazier attempt done on a
wider scale seems possible
but how much does that take
but how much power does that take that's
one thing that we learned that there's
a power drain anytime you want to do
magic there's a cost
to this i mean unless you pull
unless you pull the the cost from other
people which is a theoretical
possibility
i'm still worried about uh
doing this through sheer numbers
especially if the casualties that we
i would hope that they can find some
sort of
what's plan b then if we can't go with
numbers what do you think we should do
i i'm trying to push for another month
of the japanese looking into
[Music]
any methods to to hold this together
um well the car
the car siri at least i don't know about
the flush tank we weren't able to do
anything to that but
the car is siri at least died to
explosives
bullets if we're able to strafe the
island most of the problem will go away
pretty quickly and that
that won't cause any i mean no i'm just
saying that
if we're if we're having landing ships
disassembled in the waters
in front of it and the car siri are
underneath dragging those troops down
we're just making more cara siri
and you're right if we show up with a
hundred ships or 200 ships
yes just got more stanford can manage
them which is why i was like we got to
get stanford off the island
subterfuge well i mean hey look what's
happening over here
i mean can it can stanford do that to
100 ships we know
we know they can do it with one but can
they do it with more
terrible idea was that stanford or was
that the bloated lady
no that was penu ah okay
and i thought stanford was becoming more
powerful than penhue
if i remember correctly stanford killed
penhue
while penn he was on a call to us for
lack of a better term
yes and took his power so he made he has
the power
he's probably more powerful than pen he
was delightful
the japanese did have an aircraft
carrier in their navy
in in 1925 ooh
not anymore no no it was
it was the destroyer that was destroyed
okay aircraft carriers aircraft carriers
are very different
if you're gonna if you're gonna send you
know yeah you know fighter planes will
not make it
right 1920s to great dragon island
but if we did have an aircraft carrier
with several aircraft we could
launch and strafe
i i've i think i mean i don't i'm not a
military person
and i'll glance over at hollister but it
seems better to me to
destroy the ground forces from above as
much as we can
if we can get them there while stanford
is busy with something else
at that point one of the guards will let
in taro
yeah and he comes in and he's he's in
he's in full uniform
and he looks a little surprised
i it is very nice to see you all
i'm
i'm genuinely surprised surprised that
we're alive or that we made it over here
um your your friend flint has been
uh our friend flint has been very
helpful and
uh is is responsible for
uh a great deal of advancement in uh
japanese knowledge of uh
of both military
and paramilitary
uh means of combating these
uh these foes and i understand
i know a little i've heard a little
something about your uh
what i assume was your actions in egypt
and oh there it is
um and um
anything that you could offer well
and he'll he'll come down and he'll lay
out a map
of what they you know what they've
uh surmised from grey dragon island
and you know it's it's again there
are no buildings
on the island they have surmised that
there is a
a an entry there's like a cave at
like the peak of the island
and that is where things seem to come
from
um and we
we are very interested in what they are
doing there
uh we we have plans i know that
i know that flint does not agree with uh
the
the speed with which we wish to do
things but um
it is our opinion that
the longer we let that viper sit the
bitten
agreed agreed that's fair
um flint did raise an excellent question
though about whether or not
i mean you heard about what happened to
the destroyer that went out there
he was there i was on that destroyer was
he i thought
he was back in japan nope taro came
along he was he was keeping the crew
together
oh that's right sorry it's been a minute
no no
uh yes my only hope
is that that was something that penhue
could do
and not something that stanford could do
i think that's a hell of a gamble
i my other hope is that he cannot do
that to more
ships right and that's what we have to
pin every hope on because i think
stanford could do it
yes he stole penus power i can assure
you
that our response this time will not be
one destroyer sounds good
something we've probably gone over if
they're dead set on that would be
con specifically constructing like a
decoy carrier like a
shell of a carrier to put forward first
and yeah yeah he he we'll we'll try
anything
um flint you know that the only thing
they're resistant to
is like bombing
they don't they you're you're a
military man it is very clear that they
don't want they don't want to destroy
what's in that island flint likes to
think of himself as being well all right
fair point yeah
but but it's it's clear that there's a
military man you know they
they want to take this island they don't
want to destroy this island
they think there's something of worth
there probably
something of the mythos that they can
keep i don't think flint's that smart
sorry
so i don't know if he would would put
those pieces together
and and taro like looks at all of you
he's not that dumb actually
no he's not so and and he tara looks
at all of you and he says
how how did you get into
tokyo without my knowing about it
i feel like there's some explanation
that will follow that sentence
you so you came here through the use
of magic
is that do you know this magic is it
repeatable
nope we were given a cricket with eight
legs and
when we wanted to go to tokyo the
cricket turned into a portal
we walked through the portal cricketed
here
who gave you this cricket
a shaman type person in kenya
that is somewhat out of our sphere of
influence but
that is interesting it was one time use
only yeah
that is that is regrettable
and do
we all look at joan i was gonna say
uh there are a few a few i i do know how
to
make some small
that can for for keeping people
safe or keeping the area safe but
they're small
i haven't been able to make a big one
and we do have
one of the things we've been doing is
you might have heard of in in the
different areas we've
been trying to seal up
some of these beings to seal them away
so they can't attack the earth anymore
have you been heard about that audible
goal yes
so that's why we were in that's why
we were
in kenya that's why we were in
um some of the other places that we've
in egypt
um and we have
the for lack of better word the ritual
to do to seal up that island
so the bad people can't get back out of
it
but it's a specific it's hard to explain
if you haven't heard the whole mythos
and i don't have time to explain it all
to you but
uh let's just say that that there are
several gods that are trying to poke at
the earth and take it over and do with
it with they will and we don't want them
to do that and one of the places we can
seal them up is on that gray dragon
island
but it's a very specific ritual at a
very specific time of the
of the the lunar cycle and um
can you teach someone these magics
i assume you don't mean that that
particular binding ritual
because that one's very specific and
it's a very specific ritual to do bind
these people in here could we teach it
maybe but that we know how to do this we
know how to
to to to do these things we we need to
do them
yes you mentioned some sort of
protective
magic that you could create if you could
teach some of our practitioners
nascent as they are perhaps we could
begin to mass produce these items
we also need some participants
people who are innocent and
single-minded
this describes most of japan
most of japan are innocents
most of japan is single-minded in our
desire to destroy evil
that that i that's very amendable
and and commendable but we need people
who
haven't done bad things we've used
some
people used as the wrong word we've
we've
is it no the right word it's the wrong
word
no it's not but it's also the right word
we've
we have we have asked people
from some of the different faiths to
help us
with this for their own
you require religious people i was not
aware that there was a connection
between religion and magic
interesting it has to do with the
mindset
well we have a number of
uh there are great many followers of the
shinto faith
uh here in japan as well as
a number of your christians as well oh
maybe we might need to get a translator
so we can talk to them
our emma is is a very good speaker
on these matters why would you need to
talk to them
i mean they are willing participants
they're helpers
yes we will make sure that you have
willing participants
you tell us how many you need and where
you need them all right
right what i wish to return to this
protective ritual that you have
would it be possible to mass produce
this
could you teach it to someone that's a
good question
um you have documentation
yes making a lot of notes on the subject
yeah no we have we have documentation
and things and
it i would have to spend a little
time to make
sure but we can't mass produce it i mean
there there are costs to
to magic then pay the costs we will pay
the costs
all right i'd be willing to to talk
to a couple of practitioners and see
what we can do
well we would be very interested in that
that is that is
um yes i can i can arrange
that do you have a sense of time frame i
can tell you that we have
um we have plans that
range anywhere from launching
an assault on grey dragon island within
the week
and within a week
our forces would not be as concentrated
within a month we will have overwhelming
force
so better option we also need to get
that jade id before we even do any of
this so
what idol when in order in order to seal
up the beans that dr lam was talking
about we need
a a capstone basically
to to put on top of and seal it in
it's a a
real version of what's actually
happening a connector between the
spiritual and the real
from what i understand and
uh there are very particular capstones
that are used in very particular places
i see and it's a very particular jade
idol that we need
i i hint some trepidation in your tone
now we know where it is so that's that's
a bonus
yes and we know who has it which is the
bad part
i see where is it
have you heard much about madame lin
back in shanghai
[Laughter]
yes that is she is in possession of this
idol
that's right
confidentially i will tell you that we
have tried uh
three times to kill her hard isn't it
fourth time's the charm as they say
that is the hope she
has not we have not been able to poison
her
uh she no longer leaves her
compound and so we've not been able to
uh we've not been able to
uh and the one time we were able to
assault her
it did not go well what compound is she
in now
is she back in her house or abandoned
the one on the hill did she go back to
it
uh yes she is in her fa once the
once the the water tunnel or whatever
that was
left ho fangs she has taken uh
ho feng's compound over
that's troublesome do we lure her out
i wonder if that little girl is still
there
yeah but not only that it presents a
problem because hong fang was
um as well as madame lynn were
collectors of the occult which means
that
besides being an immortal gorilla she
also probably has more
spells wasn't that place flattened to
the ground
i think just the courtyard yeah the
courtyard was the where the where the
water
came through put it
put it at 35. bad
he knows how to ask where the bathroom
is
35 is better than that yeah better than
that i was going to say
with 35 35 japanese can you get me a
sword please
daggers ditto on the daggers maybe a
grenade
wow and a bicycle are you
hunting knives i mean they make good
hunting knives here
so can we count on you
it would be you would be powerful allies
and i would be
pleased to involve you in the planning
sooner rather than later
our goals lead us there as well so
i think it would be better to
consolidate forces i mean i can't speak
for everyone else here of course but
it seems the wisest course of action
yep we need we need a way to get on that
island
in a month by a month's time so yes well
the next full moon is in two weeks right
so it may be in a month and two weeks
before we
uh so two weeks
would be our target two weeks or
a month and two weeks see
and you have to have this i mean
could we assault this assault
and destroy everything there and seal it
at a later time
once we've destroyed everything there
potentially does this
because they must know when
you have to do this and so attacking at
that time is a terrible idea
that makes sense that makes sense yeah
if we could wipe it out and hold it
that would be good but holding it that
is the question
yes well if stanford's gone is there
going to be a problem holding it
he's the only one who seems concerned
with it currently
i don't know how many other members of
the carlyle expedition were there and
how many have we not accounted for yet
i think you've gotten everybody well
then we're in much better shape than i
thought we were
yeah unless for some weird reason madame
lynn knows something
oh did you guys ever get in touch with
uh jack brady i thought he was done
you were there for that no i mean after
he left uh
to get started up again no he he and
carl
disappeared and you know i think i think
uh i think he told i think he might have
told me where he was
going he told you where roger was
i thought he was assaulting the island
and of course
he didn't survive as far as i know no no
he
no no no he didn't go he didn't go for
the island he went to go
rebuild or want to say like
in indonesia or something in malaysia he
went to malaysia
where roger is because he put roger in
an asylum there and so he went there and
you know he he was upset that
you know that the things were you guys
were just like let's go attack now
and he was and so he
and that you you told actually he was
really upset that you told the japanese
that was his and so
when he figured out that the new chinese
front was not going to be
around much longer he started looking
for another army wherever he could find
it
well but yes you you can count on us
to
support durian that's wonderful and and
uh professor lam
um i am very interested in engaging you
with
our our bureau
of magic as we are now calling it
the whole bureau nice yes the
the japanese military is very interested
in uh
in possible applications of these
abilities
all right we have been we have been
working to identify
optimal practitioners of these abilities
nice well there's there's a rather
significant
out rape yes um
it's it is difficult it does
take a bit out of the person personally
and of the friends around them to get
some of these things
done so i will let me gather my notes
and uh
put together a a cogent uh
a way to apply this tell me how does the
can't talk about that i don't know
i'm not american i haven't i have no i
have no idea
well then forgive me for asking an
and know that you have the full support
can i ask a favor
of course when we left africa
i was left without my usual weaponry the
daggers that i usually carry
not the tourist make that i was
pointed at but
good short short short bladed weapon
ring
oh well do you need to borrow mine
kick off my strapping with my house it's
not like a a hunting knife not not quite
what you're
looking for i mean i can use that
better
than what you're looking for it's a lot
harder to conceal especially since i'm
tiny again
of course now it will take some
time to have blades made
to your specifications our our
weapons masters
uh well um
our our the art of
of the art of blade making is
uh is is a is a declining one
in japan and but i'm sure we can find
suitable weapons that have been made
and
if all of this is successful we can have
custom made exactly to your
specification
by the best weapon masters that japan
has to offer
what about some good old-fashioned
grenades it's gonna take a while though
i'm still holding out my
my hunting knife for the time being
we i will have you you give him a
description
i will have some acceptable blades
sent to you or where are you staying
uh the american embassy at the moment
uh accommodation from that to us would
you prefer
we we can as we have set up your friend
our friend flint here we can set you up
in a
much safer for everyone involved frankly
honestly probably yes that might be an
excellent idea
and i'm only asking for like five ten
grenades
[Laughter]
uh you're sleeping inside of the
building for me
we will make sure that there are
suitable explosives when we begin the
assault on gray dragon
island and just five beforehand like
tomorrow
um i do not think that we will be giving
you explosives while you are in tokyo
why uh
i have seen what you do to hotels which
is why we're at a compound
tokyo has had a history of tragic fires
and we do not wish to tempt
any of the fates very well i will
um i will send someone to
uh collect you and bring you to the com
that would be wonderful thank you very
well great all right
so yeah i was gonna say also i need
accommodations for dog
as he rocks like as he walks out the
door i'm just gonna like yell that as he
walk as he leaves hoping that he sort of
hurt it but not really
a dog did one of them get turned into a
dog as well
the fact that that's the first thing
that he thought is wonderful
uh and he will he will head off and sure
enough you know
about six o'clock a military attache
will show up at the usa
thinking yeah yeah you head back to
hollister
no hollister was there for it all he
listened to it all you know
hollister did not go he i thought he
said he was coming with us yeah
you said that he went along so i was
just like he was just not saying
anything because he didn't want to give
anything away
and also i think with the conversation
that was there
he'd want to have a therapy session with
joan
sooner rather than later yeah
what do you mean what were we thinking
with what we always think
explosives fire
animals magic yeah
i can't accept their accommodations i
have to stay here
why not yeah why because i have
incredibly sensitive material
and sensitive knowledge i know the inner
workings
my eyes rolling when you say that you
have like your
your what was that part again it's
just just that's past how we
handle magic users i don't know
don't tell put your book on it don't
tell him that you're part of the united
states military then
then there's no problem this is you're
just a doctor
he's intelligence right but you've
already sent info back where you're
supposed to be staying right that's
right
i think it's not that american embassy
i'm not leaving i
can't leave it's fine hollister well
just meet with us later it's fine i mean
let's put it this way it either burned
down a compound or i burned down the
yeah embassy embassy's worse emphasis
exactly
so i should go emma why don't we try not
burning down this building
yeah we try all the time we just don't
try successfully
having explosives makes it more likely
that it will happen just throwing that
out there
always i mean sometimes it's just a
match
that hotel that that burned down earlier
was because of a of a grenade that
landed wrong
which one was that the china
oh yeah shanghai because i was like the
boat wasn't me
um bang height with the pieces of bitey
paper that grab donald
pieces of bitey paper yeah okay when
you've got bite well i've got a dog now
to fight biting paper
so wait before before we go
there we go right there right there
that's more of a cat thing to do but
sure
holly holly show so you're saying i
you have to be can we talk
yeah go ahead
sure and at some point someone needs to
bloody well fill me in on what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
happened in africa
well i i can i'll tell it to you it's
fine i'll tell you all
the things inner conversation
uh so so hollister and lam are gonna
go off and have a a private conversation
uh and i think nick is gonna send you
a chat message about that conversation
uh
and alexandra and donald will get caught
up
on so so many things i'm gonna
train the dog i'm gonna work on sit
stay attack like we're gonna work
through this
dog training if i can't have explosives
i'm gonna have an attack dog an attack
bloodhound
uh so flash does not seem to take to
attack
but everything else he does pretty well
but um
there's a lot of you know like flopping
um he's kind of like you're you know he
probably has legs but they're under like
aha but i know exactly what we're going
to do with him
[Music]
all right i'm going to continue cuddling
um so emma are you gonna do anything
before
uh before the
attache shows up to take you to your new
location
just other than like working with the
bloodhound
to try things like finding people
all right yeah no he yeah he's got that
like he'll you he can find sense and
stuff and
like you like you hold him down and
he'll go run to the right door and he'll
point at the door and then
he'll be like scratching okay yeah my
brain is thinking things
i'll get back to you on it all right uh
so the um
about six o'clock the attache shows up
and hollister's not going is anybody
all right i mean i'm going i'm not
american
i i don't fit in the american embassy or
the tokyo place
yeah we'll go with the one that's
slightly less controversial if i don't
burn down the embassy at least i can get
back into the rest of america
[Laughter]
joan's gonna have to be persuaded either
way she she she
comes out of talking this dr hollister
very drunk
very you've not seen her
this uh
i needed to get mellow
this is gonna look for you joan this is
mellow
you're hauling quicken together all
right i did i'd drink before but this is
i yeah special occasion i needed to be
mellow
i don't think we should leave holly
alone
you want to stay with allister it's fine
he's not a combatant and neither are you
if you if you
be careful with what you tell them they
want me to teach them about all the
magic which i thought was pretty cool at
first but then
then then what well
what what they use the magic to fight
the uh
bloody island people i guess oh
but what happens after that then who
else do they go after and what do they
do
and well
so america gets all the match because
that's what's going on here the usa gets
a monopoly on the magic
hey hey donal can you kill the rest of
this bottle of scotch
absolutely i need someone to take this
give
it to me let your turn
they're only too happy
because you know i i just god
just been thinking about it and thinking
well take take some takes and take some
time
sleep on it okay that sounds like a good
idea i think i'll just go to sleep now
yeah all right that's good you stay here
john but just keep this in mind of
course
if they want you to teach the magic
you're saying no what are they gonna
do the rest of us you know business from
what this is a little pro quo here right
you know that you have a little bit we
give a little bit
and it was clear you know flint made it
made it clear that that was what he was
doing he was
he was helping the japanese with that
in return for the japanese leading the
assault on grey dragon island
western flint are doing two very
different things yes
look if if if we can't get if we can't
get ever
the thing sealed by the eclipse and save
the world and it isn't going to matter
who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] has the most magic things
after we save the world grandiose
statement but whatever
after we after we get through the
eclipse
then we can sort out you know what na
what nations have what
i don't want to do with that it's not my
problem
we're not nations products a couple of
people
no but teach them how to do this
please don't hit me with that
i keep this with me just cause has it
been very useful for us
no i mean did it protect us from you
know who
no or any other nonsense has attacked us
well it has done some we've gotten some
of those smaller
critters away but not the bigger ones
no make a big this is a small one but i
know how to make a big one
okay but you didn't
down what how about you go get some rest
hey john you've got some time all right
so who's that talking to me alexandria
yes okay all right i'm going to go to
bed then
um so hollister and lamb are staying at
the embassy
everybody else is going to the compound
all right yeah take pictures
flint is not at the compound he has his
own place that he wants to stay
it is a you are you are definitely
like
in a controlled neighborhood so they're
you know you pass through a checkpoint
and all this stuff
um yeah that's right hollister like
flint likes his bath that's why he
doesn't want to leave he's got the
um and so it is it is a very
traditional you know paper walls
um and um
it's it's a lovely building you are
you
you are very well taken care of there
are
bedrooms for all of you so there are two
bedrooms that are not being used
and
i'm going to take the mattresses from at
least one other bedroom to just
you know fluff mine up like the princess
yes
exactly like the princess i am all right
hollister and lamb make me a luck roll
okay
and then i got a hard success 17.
oh my god i did not make a luck roll
so you take hollister's and
emma make me a spot hidden roll when you
do that
ooh also too do i find like a
well-stocked bar
so you there's lots of sake
okay i'll drink that so it's a regular
success
all right a regular success okay
um when you um
when you move hollister's mattress
uh a piece of paper falls out from
the bottom of it nobody sees me put it
like nobody sees you're alone in his
room right now
yeah i'm putting that in my pocket and
then i'm gonna continue to rifle through
the room
like now it's like it's on all right
um you you don't find anything else
as you rifle through the room are you
yeah yeah you don't find anything else
uh and you you're
you get back to your room and load the
mattress on yeah so i fluff it up and
crawl into bed and then pull it out of
my pocket and open it up what is it
i'm assuming i can't read it no it's
um it is it is an
origami animal
it is it looks
but so it's it's got like you know it's
got like
uh wings sort of in the back and then
the body up here it's an or
yeah an origami hummingbird that has
been it was kind of flattened under his
bed but
ooh so i jump out of bed and rip up my
bed is there anything
under mine make a spot hidden role
i'm tearing my room apart at this point
all right that's called
pushing the roll yep exactly um
poop i don't make it as an idea yeah you
could
push through 29 i don't know
i have two of the same i've showed dice
with me i have two of the same dice it's
either 92 or 29.
ah you could push the roll and like
if you make it great if you don't like
you really tore your room apart
okay so i'm gonna push the roll and
green is tens
and purple is ones there we go green two
one is ten three is tens green is ten
where is that so green is a thirty and
purple
is a five so yeah no problem so yeah you
you start pulling things apart and
um you find in your room
uh behind there's a wood carving
on the wall and behind it you find
um an aura another or origami thing this
one
um this one kind of looks
like a gorilla
oh so i go basically barreling out of my
room yelling
i think we're gonna get attacked by
bitey paper things again
i don't know and i'll just look at like
all right back that sentence up
about five steps get me a cage look what
i found
under my this is okay so i won't explain
how i found this under hollister's
or somebody's bed but i found this under
somebody's bed
these rooms have been on any of us the
first time we've stepped in here we just
grabbed a room what what what is it
it's an origami animal
yeah it's an origami animal and then i
found an origami gorilla
in my room these rooms were prepared
for us all right let's let's do our
thing let's take the throne apart
so i'm the gorilla this is kind of
offensive you chose the room i don't
know you're you're connected you're
connected to madame lynn
i can see where the connection would be
all i know is that
i'm either as part of me wants to see
what's going to happen but part of me
also wants to burn these but part of me
also wants to put him in a cage
well let's burn him so alex i'll take
this side to the other side
yeah so donal in your room you find um
an origami
snake i'm we're in the same room here so
it's one
all right yeah you guys took one room
all right so in your room there's an
origami snake
and there are two other empty so there
are three empty bedrooms then they they
made you each
a room is nobody's nobody's there to
stop us as we continue to remove
nope no they're i mean there are two
guards out there are two soldiers
outside but you know they don't they
don't come in yeah
i'll i'll go so the the room that donald
and i tear apart is the one that would
have been assigned to him
i think i'll go i'll go to the one that
would have been mine and start pulling
that one apart
yeah there's an origami like ram each
each room has an origami animal
hidden somewhere in it so we have a
hummingbird gorilla
[Laughter]
i think i got the wrong room yeah i
think so
so we'll collect them all together and
just like
right cage or burning let's burn them no
i mean what happens if they're good luck
uh how would they find out who's going
to tell us they're good
i don't know anybody here that we could
matches i got some matches right here
yeah
pull out matches line it up all right
yeah they
they burn quite handily i'm sure there
weren't messages on them
good so yeah you
you you you burn all of those it's
a p
you you're very careful given that you
were living in a paper house
to control all of that
um everybody
well the three of you make me pow
rolls
wow this is a few times that i'm like
i'm all right at that yeah
nope it doesn't matter which way it goes
that's for me right so alexandra you
are aware that when these things burn
like the smoke
has a weird almost like purplish color
to it
just look at that with my head tipped
that's odd i wonder why that smoke is
purple
evil i mean i don't necessarily
associate purple with evil but sure
that we burned it then agreed
okay andrew wonder if we missed
something
probably i'm sure we did uh
the role play a long conversation or we
just skip over i don't know
uh it's it's it's mostly just tell me
what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happened in africa
because i remember nothing from the
moment that i was called in to be the
pharaoh's champion
we have some sake or whatever and some
and
sit on the mats on the floor the futons
yeah
you are all caught up you are all caught
up uh
everybody the three of you uh
all right success i'm looking for a hard
success here
thanks reagan oh i got a 15. i don't
know where that
listen is on my thing but i feel like 15
[Music]
15 is probably a hard success for you it
seems like it should be 53 is my listen
that is a hard success okay all right so
um it's like two three in the morning
who knows and everyone is blissfully
sleeping
uh emma flash actually kind of
you get woken because flash who is like
curled up at your feet
like looks up and you swear that you
so i am
now upset that taro did not give me any
grenades
or a sword or anything this is all his
fault
and i'm like standing on my bed
um can i see anything on the ground
uh you you it sounds like it's out in
the hallway
and so what we see is um
there's that that backlit kind of you
know the light
from the moon is like backlighting the
paper
of the wall and you see a
a sadly familiar spider kind of shadow
like moving through the hall is there a
window in the room
uh i mean no so there's no way to get
access outside
i mean it's a paper wall exactly that's
exactly what
if there's no window then i'm going to
make a slit and me and flash are going
to run outside
and then run back inside well i mean the
the interior walls we made of paper not
the exterior
yeah the interior wall the exterior wall
is wood yeah
so who's like who would be next to me uh
next to you is one of the empty rooms
on either side okay so and from what i
remember the room was the door would be
shut right
i mean so these doors are actually like
sliding panels
oh so i could just slide into the next
room i don't have to cut a hole into the
next room through a wall
well no you have a sliding panel into a
hallway yeah
um but the rooms don't have doors
connecting to each other
so you gotta slice through into yeah you
slice through into
uh hollister's room there's no
mattress in there
super quiet with flash creeping through
quiet quiet quiet i'm hoping i'm going
the opposite direction
of or what i'm trying to do is go the
opposite direction of the uh
spider okay you found all of the origami
creatures right
yeah you didn't yeah you got all you got
all five number five yeah
all right uh
who's next so it looks like this thing
is heading towards
it looks like it's coming out of the
hallway and heading towards the front
door so i'm heading towards wherever
these two are
flash by the way is staying on the bed
just like
i'm pulling i'm like come on fire so
let's go
uh and and so are you gonna try to get
to their room are you gonna try and
follow this
okay yeah so you you cut through and you
can you can easily wake them up
yep and i'm like hey hey there's another
spider thingy in here
then through the wall probably gonna
wake us up well yeah
yeah cutting through the wall wakes you
both up yeah yeah alexandria reaching
for daggers that aren't there
what's going on i know he wouldn't even
give me explosives there's a spider here
you don't have daggers i don't have
grenades this is
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guns what do you need
spider hallway go
which which kind of spider is it the eye
spiders of the paper spider
i ca it all i hear is tickety-tickity
and icy legs
and things i don't need to look i just
need to not know
okay what what did you use to cut
through to here
fingernails really she kind of she kind
of tore her way through yeah i'm like
it's not it was not
subtle all right it's like christmas
emma do you want to do you want a pistol
emma i can give you a pistol
sure i'm gonna go get flash
all right yeah you head back to the room
uh as you're heading back to the room
uh it seems like there is some sort
of source of light at the front of this
house
like the light is brighter at the front
of the house
all right alex you wanna what do you
want
you have another pistol i can use one of
not my preferred but i don't know we'll
make

pizzas to the czech republic
of course you can why would you why'd
you send pizzas to an email address
well you know they're just pictures of
pizza that's it
um you know so like
my german is okay but for some reason
ordering
food is the one thing i can't do that's
the first thing i can do in any language
i don't speak spanish but i can get a
drink go to the bathroom and eat
that's it i we
the last time i was in germany we called
a pizza place to order pizza
and it was like a 20-minute ordeal as i
was just like for
i for whatever reason it doesn't it's
doesn't work but so
um so you don't have to worry about me
ordering pizzas in foreign countries
because i can
not do it it's like so years ago
i might have already told this story i
don't know i was in munich with uh
with somebody else and uh
we went it was a cold rainy miserable
night
and we went to we went out to eat we
went to this bavarian restaurant
and you know i was reading the menu
for her
and i was like well this says goulash
and you know looks good and all that and
so
she got that my favorite bavarian
and i was looking at the menu and i was
like well chicken and vegetables and
i don't know why it says egg that's kind
of weird but so like
her goulash comes and it's just this you
get warm looking at it it's got warm
bread with it and it's just
ah it's everything you want on a on a
cold day
and then my dish
comes and it's a dish about a it's a
not it's like a bowl about that deep of
cold
gelatin with like cold chicken
and vegetables and a half a hard-boiled
egg
floating in it and apparently it's some
bavarian especially
but it was oh it was terrible that
sounds awful
yeah yeah so i will order everyone
else great food and then i'll get myself
something awful that is just always the
way in
german restaurants i would say it's just
a couple of recommendations
um in munich lowenbrow the beer is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
the pork shank is amazing
yeah it's true yeah it's weird like
the the breweries the little cafes and
breweries have
awesome food asperger my favorite beer
and also mildly okay sausages
um hof brow house skip it yeah the hot
press yeah
what else is there where else did i
drink everywhere the park i got drunk in
where else did i get drunk i don't know
i feel like i
i feel like where you didn't get drunk
is it yeah that's right that's the least
that's much shorter list the the the
seedier and smaller the donor stand the
better the donor
my favorite donor stand is actually in
the hauptbahn hof in the middle yes
every morning i would get breakfast in
the hop on hop
we'd like we're right down the street
from it and i would get apple juice
because they get sparkling apple juice
in germany
um what else i don't even know yeah hmm
app full charles
okay one day we'll get to get on a plane
again sorry yeah i know right now
well and i'm feeling it this with this
week
actually i would be leaving for bgg con
usually
curry first i love me some curry first
um
did you have did you have spaghetti ice
while you were there
nope i don't even know what i just drank
a lot and just
it's about correct answer yep
who's my who's my honeymoon what else
are you supposed to do
even i drink beer in germany and you
don't drink beer because usually it's
cheaper
yeah cheaper than water yeah yeah
oh yeah i know mita gas is without like
bubbles so like
this is like gas yeah and they
like if you're basically if you're
asking for ona
water you're just getting tap water it's
which is what i usually like to drink
but um
all right so yeah in you have
you have managed to get rid of all
the protection in your house
and carl stanford has shown up
so he he's basically standing in the the
front hall room
of your house and there's some sort of
light source that you can see through
the walls
um and he he basically says i want to
talk
well no one's stopping you from talking
where are you
we can see him right he's in front of us
so no he's a he's around the corner like
yeah go ahead and talk we can hear you
you can hear us
is there a way to get around to the
other side of where he is
i mean you can if you cut through walls
sure go down we need your knives right
now
um you can tear through walls but it'll
probably be
slightly noisy yeah so that's not that's
not really gonna work
all right so and he's talking as a
spider
uh no well he i mean you saw a spider
go that way
i mean this is stanford he's teased
material in front of us
it sounds like it but again all you can
see is some sort of light source around
the corner through the paper
actually you can see shadows you see a
human figure yeah okay backlit
he's like backlit and he's in the
hallway i'm assuming like there's a long
hallway and at the end of the hallway
would be the front door right
yes is there a back door no
i'll i'll look at donald and just like
point at the outline of of
the body that is outlined very nicely
for us through the paper and be like
do we let them talk or do i just shoot
them
i'm not getting any closer is there a
window
i remember what this bastard did tonight
yeah i know
i'm here to give you everything you want
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you can talk fella we're not
fair enough you haven't done anything to
engender our trust
so talk i don't know how you did it
but you have shut down africa
all right and so
so i'm here to make you an offer i've
heard that before
i'm gonna give you whatever you want
and you're gonna go away and leave me
alone you've seen what i can do
when you are something that i feel
deserves my attention you're getting
very close
to being something that deserves my
well i understand that someone
might have recently offered you some
real estate in ireland
everything you've done i know about
so
i can make that real estate your dream
you can get away you can leave
all of this as i said
you've set us back
the world will not be ending in january
congratulations so what
these things take a great deal of time
and
it may become necessary to alter my
plans
i am a man of many abilities
but i'm not sure that even i can take on
luckily and you don't need to know how
i happen to know that in a few years i
won't be taking on the whole japanese
army
why not because
i've been to the future then why do you
need to make a deal with us
and like i said congratulations you've
put nida chris in charge she happens to
hate me
yeah one good thing we did well she
i'm offering you everything you want
oh god no honestly
i think my i don't know you know
pope schmo i mean that's fine i'd rather
be the pope's banker
i could make that happen i can give you
everything you want all you have to do
is go away
you've sealed almost all of them good
i want to finish the job you're not
this is not an opportunity
for me to demonstrate how quickly i
could kill you
because i think i've demonstrated that
already
this is an opportunity for me
again you were given
that that sad little man gave you a
cottage
in the middle of nowhere on the coast in
i can give you a manner in the ir in the
in the moors in the irish moors
i can make you a nobleman
you and your paramour can live the rest
of your life
in beautiful seclusion no one bothering
you
you can have small children that like
uh i've done this before friend it
well you made a deal you had no
intention of keeping
all right that's a deal i couldn't make
and uh
this is a deal you can make until what
until i walk back and then the deal is
off
what would you walk back let's say i
walk away and then i
why would you do that what if i
well then i'll kill you it's darkly hard
to enjoy even a manner off in ireland
when the world could end at any point i
don't need a manner
or a lordship or whatever that's
nonsense i can tell you
that well
unless something dramatically changes
the next time that the world will be
that
would be in
[Music]
that's hardly a lifetime that's only 19
alternatively that's 19 years away
that's 19 years of peace and quiet
without any fears or worries
not looking over your shoulders not
wondering who's coming to kill you now
that's 19 years of freedom
sickness
always war there's always sickness
i didn't say there wasn't going to be
war oh there is a
terrible war coming you will be
unscathed by it
what happened to silvano
i can give you silvano no what happened
i'm a surgeon penhue
was a hack penhue
was using your friend silvano as a
battery
i have i had no need of that
so where is he is he still on grey
dragon island
walk away and he can be waiting for you
well i'm not a miracle worker
but he will be
he will live a long and full life he's
insane isn't he
his brain turned into gelatin between
his ears
well his brain was removed from his body
right now his body is being kept
alive
essentially through my good will
his brain his brain is not
oh savannah's gone oh no
i can call his brain back at any time
i don't know that but you told me
exactly as much as you intended to tell
me
he is fully conscious and he's
actually
uh he's learned a great deal oh the poor
bastard
what do you want to come home yes
very much
i'm sure i'm sure every minute of it's a
i is jd if only jd matthews were here
he would
he app he would appreciate how i'm
bastardizing stanford's story
[Laughter]
uh i have seen i have not even seen the
future i've
i know what's to happen
unless we change it again
i mean you could just if you say so you
could just kill us right
now and that would stop us from doing
this so what's the point of this
there are very important reasons why i
can't
emma is difficult to kill
are you not are you not allowed to kill
constance
is that what the game is oh
you you mistake the dart the black
pharaoh
while technically some would consider
my boss i don't he
was constrained by that ridiculous game
i am not i'm not
so then why can't you kill the majority
of us
clearly there's rules you're abiding by
i understand the implications of
killing and what it
the impact it would have unlike that
idiot penhue
i wish to dominate the earth as it
exists currently
i wish to be emperor of the earth i
don't want to
reign over some hollowed-out ball
what's the use of dominion if you have
then why do you want to go on with the
ritual isn't that the point of the
ritual is to bring
whatever he who i won't name
the point of mine is to close
the gap that they created
in some ways we have the same goal
you want to close the portals as well or
the
let me see if your little monkey brains
can understand this
i have built a titanic weapon
the likes of which the world has never
seen
this weapon coupled with my
knowledge of the mythos
the rend through which penhue hoped to
yank
surgeon
so what are you excising in order to do
what you're doing
what cost some mild radiation damage
to whoever's close by and
by the way you have no idea what
radiation is nope
i i'm just letting that pass right on by
because i don't know i don't care right
now
and great dragon island will be
uninhabitable for
sounds a good demand exactly
really i'm doing the world a favor
all you have to do is walk away i have a
portal
right here next to me
i'm not going through your portal that's
what you're asking that's the no-go
i've dealt with that nonsense before
all right you can take a boat and meet
emma oh i thought you were talking about
the bloated woman sorry i got confused
for a minute
oh that's a good question is the blooded
woman on gray dragon island
she's a very poor house guest i'll just
say you act like you don't like her much
you're like
with most aspects of naiarthotep
no you had to say that name she
uh she is very used to getting her way
but we've come to an understanding and
she will be on the island when i fire
the weapon
and she's all right with that of course
not
i did not tell her she will be destroyed
i'm not an idiot like you people
i'm omniscient i have been
vacuum i have seen lights that you can
turn off by clapping
i have seen telephones that can read you
shakespeare
that sounds useful
uh i know emma what do you think
oh i'm having thoughts
[Laughter]
they're all terrible apparently two of
them
par for the course right yeah so mr
stanford
we appreciate the offer we're gonna need
don't look at me like that i mean you
basically say like
do this or that which is like
life-altering you know i just you know
i've been running on this track for so
long that it's like
i really just have to sit down and talk
to my doctor about this
also we aren't the whole team we can't
make decisions for the others
oh they're not part of this agreement or
what
we can't i can offer them whatever they
want as well
we can't make decisions for the rest of
oh i don't know if they're going to
decide but then make decisions for me
either
hey stanford why don't you call me on
you haven't been to the future you don't
have an iphone
i do i just laugh at him
does it do and i can even get service in
sorry literally none of those words mean
anything tell these people they're
doomed if they don't listen to me
you are doomed if you don't listen to
him do you
do you understand that that most of
those words mean nothing to us and so
they aren't just nearly
nearly as impressive as you think they
are
just because the monkey doesn't know how
the water wheel works doesn't mean the
monkey doesn't know the water wheel
works
listen emma's right we need to think
about
this i'll give you that
um sorry about your guards
and then the light goes out bastard
all right so i've got the perfect setup
we're going to get madame lynn to fight
him
how are we going to get madame here in
24 hours she's a
she's a crazy gorilla lady i'll just be
like the most powerful weapon in order
to take over the world is on grey dragon
island
if that's not the next episode title
i'll eat a hat i mean
it didn't how long did it take us to get
from shanghai to great dragon island
it was like it was it was it was like a
day and a half
yeah okay and you weren't a destroyer
i'm not inclined to make a deal with the
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i have
absolutely no reason to believe that he
will keep the deal and
no reason to believe that he won't
continue the ritual in
what 19 years 19 years is
i mean it's good but it's not 100 and
whatever
the next cycle of when this happens why
is he why is he talking to us now
if he's the future then there's
something he sees in the future that
leads him to believe he needs to not
kill us now
well and that's the real question isn't
it why is he making deals with us
because he's afraid of the japanese to
take his weapon
i bet you ten dollars because he doesn't
care about the bloated lady or us
or the ritual or any of that stuff the
japanese are after whatever he has if
the three of us leave the japanese can
still go take his weapons there's
nothing to do with the three of us
right i mean what why is
is there something in the future that he
sees that he wants
us alive for do you know what i'm saying
maybe we invent the shakespeare phone
[Laughter]
i mean it's not gonna be me but i mean i
wouldn't invent
the the the phone but i have a
particular fondness for shakespeare
i'm just saying i mean
he i think he wants us alive that's what
scares me
all of these bastards want us alive they
and he also has a problem with knight of
chris
i don't know i don't think that we can
turn
the person who will be queen of africa
eventually
toward stanford although you know if he
wants to be emperor of the world
that could get very interesting oh i see
what you're saying emma i say
but we can't go you you told me donald
we can't go back to africa
we can't go back to africa but i think
if we did if we like
why can't we just call her on the
shakespeare phone
bunny shank spare phone i'm just saying
he talked about it like it was the
greatest thing ever so i just you know
and that does get alexandria to laugh
breaking the tension just a little bit
something happens in the future that you
want us online for i can't get over that
thought
it's otherwise we know he'd be killing
us all right now if we were an obstacle
we're not an obstacle to this fella
well yeah you're right why is he making
a deal with us because
he shouldn't like something is
for us is going to impede his progress
with his weapon
i don't think it will if we if we can
get there with the japanese military
with what we
know with the plans that hollister has
as a lover it's nothing to do with us
the japanese military they'll do what
they do it has to be
because otherwise we're irrelevant to
him he
he wouldn't care about us he doesn't
care about us or the bloated lady
or stealing any of the any stuff if that
was the only impact we had
because he cares about the weapon and
ruling the world so we
get in there somehow and screw it up
like we always do we're we're a linchpin
i'm i agree with emma we're a linchpin
in some
some means something that we do
only i had that phone i could figure it
out
sorry i'm sorry i will let the phone go
now i promise no you won't
in so carl stanford in in old call of
cthulhu
was in a module another scenario
in a campaign and he ran this fake cult
called the order of the silver twilight
and one of the things that he did
he found a portal to the future and he
would like
impress his followers by being like and
look
it's a phone but there's no court like
he would just get like crappy
it's a toast it make your bread and
he would just get like crappy stuff from
the future and give it to
like and show it to his fathers they'd
be like magic
wow traditionally advanced science looks
like magic
i just i just pushed stanford up to
listen i don't i i know this sounds
ridiculous
i just don't think that we're the ones
that stop whatever it is that he's doing
the japanese can stop him
it's not about every three of us there's
no reason
why he would come and bargain with us
if there was if there was nothing that
we could do if we were not somehow
and he says he's not constrained by the
same rules involving constance
which emma jones and i are so what is it
why is why are we so god's damned
important
i wish i knew but something that we do
is important something that we do stops
him
and he's trying to stop us before we do
maybe it's not us don't miss out the
three of us
maybe it's something that jon or
hollister knows
maybe but why did he come at us and he
was quick to say i can kill them
i mean he can kill us too yeah
listen i don't know i mean he thinks i
an idiot i would pay money to see you be
the pope
i don't need a large mansion or a house
or a large berlin nonsense i don't care
about any of that
but listen i'm just a i'm just a gun i'm
not nothing special
i don't know magic i don't have any
battle plans i'm not part of some
secret u.s military program uh
i'm just a guy with guns i don't so
whatever it is
it's not to do with me it's one of the
other two or three of you
[Music]
but it does have to do with you donal
because you have to do with us
maybe has to do with you no i don't know
i'm a constant whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
means
listen we don't do magic we don't close
portals i can't
i can't do that again a bloody well
can't do that portal thing again
nearly killed me last time that's what
you said
i don't know emma you were there
we can't do that again no but the
japanese are going to help us this time
the japanese will blow the whole thing
up and steal whatever it is that
stanford has
used and they'll use it for their own
means of course
they'll just use it for their own means
but is it better to let the japanese
for i mean we're gonna accidentally do
that anyway i have just a suspicious
feeling that nothing's gonna go right
everybody's gonna go it's all gonna go
wrong for everybody and we're gonna be
to blame
so really i don't really worry too much
about this magical weapon
maybe it's am i you have you're the one
to blow it all up
been there done that all right you've
done that before right
maybe it's got nothing to do with the
two of us emma it's just it's you he
wants out to
just bungle my way through the future
no he said he saw the future and we were
all involved it's not just emma
it's all of us but what i'm thinking is
maybe it's emma the one he wants out
i mean and he would have just given his
offer to emma he spoke
very specifically to you yeah he spoke
to your
damned manner i don't know
so something that you do is important
you
specifically you're not just a gun
you're important in this whether you
oh yeah it was really important to me he
wouldn't offer me some bloody house
yeah i mean pope come on i mean clearly
he
over overestimates what he thinks we
want because he thinks of what he would
want in our situations he
thinks of pope for you emma because you
work for the catholic church and in his
brain everyone wants to be the top of
whatever organization they work for
and for you a manner and a lordship
because he can't imagine
just wanting to go to a quiet little
cottage
in the back end of nowhere and just live
sounds just that sounds good right now
frankly but he misunderstood us
and underestimated us you also
he also potentially tipped his hand by
saying that
i mean it sounds like he wants to be
i mean he clearly wants to be the
emperor he doesn't want to be somebody's
minion
you want something interesting about all
that donal what's that
i'm one of the two constant standing
he offered it to you you
are important in this you're not just a
gun
i don't know what i'm supposed to do
neither do i but
that's never stopped us before has it
yeah we just do whatever it is that emma
doesn't
follow right along right bungle up the
future that's what we do
range
why why this could have been over
if i if i had a dagger
so as you're like standing in the
hallway having this conversation
um you're recalling that he said he like
he like said
he apologized about what he'd done to
your guards oh yeah
oops yeah
i'm going back to bed i'm not gonna
check on the guards yeah we should call
taro and tell him that we got a
situation
okay fine yeah
need some time to think that's fine
let's do that
so you come around the corner
and you see one of those spider portals
um that is now like dead it is empty
but the the spider seems to have like
sunk its legs into the two guards
and the guards are like this the column
of the
uh of the portal and the spider is dead
it's like
um the spider is like kind of almost
like burnt out charcoal are the guards
dead
yes the guards are quite dead okay
and i don't know about joan and dr
hollister's use of portals and
this looks this looks familiar at least
to me and donald because we've seen the
fighter thing before this looks like
i remember that don't i yes you should
have yeah
uh sorry so you're calling taro
yeah i mean he put us up in here he's
got a yeah all right
he's up he's there pretty quickly uh
and with him are four men
armed well two are armed and two are
like
wearing suits and kind of one is wearing
a lab coat
uh and taro comes in he says are you all
yeah we're fine well we're alive that's
a start
the guy in the lab coat is already just
like looking at the art
the the portal and is just all over it
and he says something in japanese to
taro
and taro says what is this thing
probably a portal that's what it looks
like
a means of transportation yes apparently
who tr who ca who used it
stanford as far as we know
or at least he was stanford was here he
was either here
no he was here we saw the outline of his
body we heard his voice we saw an
outline
through the wall what did stanford want
did he attack you
um first i want to apologize that
apparently
uh your professor lamb has much to teach
us because our protective magics did
nothing
what exactly what were the protective
magics
um in our faith and you know
we you inscribe protective uh
symbols inside of origami they are small
paper-folded animals okay and you
you you conceal them so that the evil
spirits can't see them
you might have wanted to have told us
that we've had bad experiences with
paper we found them and we got rid of
them
stanford in fact with with with paper
yes
yes used paper to attack us and
me well
um i'm very sorry that that happened uh
um what did stanford what did stanford
want
he's trying to dissuade us from um
really he wanted us to go away
stanford is scared of us but he knows
that your knowledge coupled with the
might of imperial japan
we need your knowledge uh
it's really not we're not the
knowledgeable ones that's
uh you must convince i take it your
professor lamb
is the you must convince professor lam
to teach us all she knows
does she have books does she have
writings we need those
she might i don't know
she is rather a packer out of knowledge
what is it that you think
this weapon is that he has
confirmed he has a weapon yes he said
something about
radiation donald i remember that right
yeah that's the word he is right
radiation
he used words like shakespeare phone and
all kinds of crazy talk too
and he's earphone and service and yeah
he said he said a lot of strange things
he said he's
flying cars i think too yeah but the
fact that name
he has a weapon and he's i feel he's
more concerned
about the weapon than he is about
rituals or anything else he's more
concerned about losing power
he's real like being subservient to him
is like
a psychological issue he wants to be
number one
and cannot this must be
an impressive weapon probably does
does the word radiation mean anything to
you
no he it has something to do with his
weapon
he says something to the guy in a lab
coat
and the guy in a lab coat like um
[Music]
mentions yeah he'll say something in
uh radiation
some sort of power wave but it's a very
it's it it makes you sick it doesn't
kill you
he says it to us in english right yeah
yeah
yeah you've know what kind of sick
now i have to make sure that marie curie
has actually happened already
i think she does i think that is that
wasn't she eighteen hundreds i don't
think
lady teams we have an alternate version
of history
exactly the proper version you destroyed
already
so we get to fudge things um
yeah it is like like your marie
curie
who got sick studying
radiation she found uh
particles and and uh
elements that were destructive
and made her sick but i know that
meteorites right there was something
green on
on penhue's ship that made me really
sick
i thought it was some like it was
instantaneous
really sick the part was it part of the
engine
it was green and it was glowing and it
was horrible
i wonder if that's and you like you it
made you sick for a while
and then you gave that to penn him uh
and you
mm-hmm
this is entirely beyond what i can think
about at three o'clock in the morning
uh yes would you like a different
residence
yes please yes and daggers
as soon as possible please and grenades
before grenades do you think those would
have helped or would they have just
destroyed this building
i probably would have helped i think
you have a weapon you are holding a
weapon you did not use it
what difference would knives and and
explosives have made
destroy the spider before stanford
gets through
get to get get to the other side of of
where that that portal was
in a more quiet manner than tearing
again
if mr concannon
did not shoot him when he apparently had
why do you i i understand the comfort
i think that that comfort
tends to lead to far more disquiet
amongst everyone else around you
your comfort at being armed is trumped
by the discomfort of others being around
you when you are armed
can i at least have a sword to practice
with
uh yes we we can get you some bladed
weapons um
this is a very curious insistence you
have uh
we we gave you all sorts of protections
and you had protections yourself and you
did not use them i'm
very confused you should have told us
about the protection it would have it
wouldn't have burned them so
uh we've had a lot of problems of the
night of being ambushed while we're
sleeping
very disquieting as you can imagine and
he could have attacked us and he said he
wanted to talk
and then didn't attack us so we decided
not to
attack him and he wanted to make
uh what what did he want he wanted to
make an offer
with you he wanted us to go away
and what did you tell him well think
you'll think about it i mean obviously
not
and so how will you tell him your answer
i was just going to write him a note and
then leave i mean
preferably with weaponry easier to
intervention
to back up a point when you have
weaponry and protections and things like
that
you really think your weapons will do
anything to him
so what are you telling me we have to go
and attack him tonight before he comes
back tomorrow and we tell him no because
when we tell him no he's going to kill
us
i think he's i think he is still human i
think that we have dealt with his ilk
before
and it has hurt and been horrible but we
well hopefully if we put you in a new
location he won't be able to find you
um i will i will make sure that there
are men waiting here
and we will uh
we will see what we can find out
about this thing he says looking at the
portal and the guy in the jacket is
already like
going all over it and trying to figure
out what's going on with the portal
um right and one of the guys with guns
puts his hand on the spider and starts
to chant
does it sound like in japanese does it
sound like chance that we've heard
before
yeah is he is he
did you say he was a guy with a gun or a
gun he's one of the japanese he's one of
the japanese who came in
but like does he look like a soldier or
does he look like a suit he looks like a
suit with a gun okay
okay cause i would say if he was a
random soldier that just went mind like
mindlessly up to it and started chanting
and be like we got this is why we need
grenades
uh no he but so this guy is like and and
whatever he was trying to do doesn't
work and he
he seems he seems drained when
he's done and he seems tired and he and
the guy in the
the the lab coat both start talking back
and forth
and a truck pulls up and they start
to like
get a bunch of guys to take the portal
out of the house
uh with the two bodies still attached to
it
let's get some sleep yeah they'll take
you so they take you
um about five minutes away they take you
to another
very similar compound this time
taro almost in a condescending way
like shows you all the origami animals
you know what i'm okay with
condescending as long as he's actually
telling us where the protections are and
we're cool with it
yeah tamagoto gave 500 bits for grenades
i don't know if that goes to
ezra to give us grenades or yeah you're
the one who wants the grenade they're
for us
terrorists to buy grenades i'm confused
um and so yeah you will
you'll you'll get some sleep and so
uh hollister and lamb you two have had
quite a conversation
and then so it's the morning it's now
the morning of
uh hollister you get a cable back from
rogers and uh
he says to look in a mirror at 11
oh okay um
i'm thinking that with how well
things went with our talk i'd like to
have
and see if i can't
get some sand back all right so
yeah all right yeah there's uh
you know wait wait hold on hold on
you're gonna push this roll i would love
it
we didn't have we haven't though we have
a lot of like spells yeah we have like
well if we got inspo you should spend it
man well
yeah can we push it after we do inspo
yeah
okay let's let's go first
i think this really deserves success
is that hard success wow all right
so so joan
uh he he layers in
some of the stuff that you were talking
about earlier um
and and basically like making the case
of
you know like um
[Music]
what what you know sort of
uh and you get sick sanity back yes
and like i needed that there is
um there is a definite bond you feel a
definite bond of trust
and connection there sweet
that that fits very well thank you all
right
now
so that takes you up until about the
time that you're gonna you're supposed
okay okay um
are you gonna do that alone are you
gonna
and and breakfast i'm assuming we had
breakfast too i'm not doing this on an
empty stomach but
uh are you going to bring me in with are
you going to bring me in
or not if if you ask
but i wasn't planning on it okay
sometimes he's he's talking to no one
and he can't hear anyone in the mirror
i don't know if it has to do with the
i i i look i looked into getting a
really good mirror this time i made sure
i got the room with the best mirror
[Laughter]
um so yeah at 11 15
uh the mirror shimmers and
you see uc rogers
uh allister
hollister are you in japan
yes tokyo
so you're at the embassy right
yes what what is this
stat art what is the status of the
operation with the with the
uh i i've been i've been staying away
from that as much as possible
i i know that they're they're preparing
to attack
grey dragon island that's that's it and
that they want to move
sooner rather than later do you have a
sense of time frame
uh i believe they said
they didn't want to aim for the attack
to be directly on the full moon
because they felt they would be expected
at that time
but their windows within uh
so your ears only
we have confirmed that there's
some sort of mega bomb
okay i believe that's what i have the
i mean you're not a you know yeah you
think so although
again you have plans for a bomb that
flies
like there's an engine on that bomb
i mean there's planes you can put a bomb
on a plane
i mean well there are fireworks
i'm more concerned with the bomb itself
uh have you have you did you send those
plans you have not sent those plans
uh no i've been waiting for a secure way
and
actually i would have had a couple of
looks at them over the last couple days
when i've had the time
yeah so that like make me a
mechanical
repair role i can do that but i'm
more interested in the
wiring and the electronics okay
uh then make me an electrical role well
can i do
sure i mean so i'll tell you you know
based on the design of this that the
mechanical part will tell you a lot more
than the electrical part yeah i'm not
going to make that roll though
whereas the electronics i might actually
understand that facet of it
nope all right was the
so that was what was that the mechanical
oh no that was the electronic okay well
you can try the mechanical
okay i mean there's a chance it's not
zero
oh all right yeah so um
this is when it becomes clear that
munitio you are not a munitions maker so
you're like looking at plans and
you know you have a like i said you have
a general sense that this is a bomb
with an engine
uh of with some sort of propulsion or or
i mean the propulsion i might actually
be able to figure out if it's chemistry
well there's nothing about so there's no
yeah there's not
it doesn't tell you the fuel or anything
like that but it look you
i mean there's clearly you know there's
something this is this is a bomb with a
means of propulsion
which is weird um
so have where the japanese
are interested in this this mega weapon
this this bomb
we have to keep it from falling into
does this thing look small
but no the bomb looks pretty big yeah
that's look that is i can have
my pay grade i can have a ship leaving
within about two weeks but you'll all be
killed
i mean i mean we already know that it
well the plan is to get the bomb or to
uh if we can't have that bomb no one
but that bomb coming back to the us of a
okay i have no idea how to help with
that
well here's how you help with that you
find out everything you can about what
the goddamn japanese are doing
okay
magic
i i don't know i know that they have a
program
um i
i can't i can't get should i haven't
you need to find out everything they
know about
magic and what they're doing if they're
starting some sort of
if that we can't the world can't afford
for imperial japan to have a delta green
they've already shown with their actions
that these are not peace-loving people
okay i don't need convincing you you
gave me the order
it's imperative that the united states
of america
lead the mythos industrial complex
i'm knocking on the mirror now i i
accepted the order i
i got i heard you wait i
i can't hear one damn it aldridge
and he starts to like shimmer again ah i
so coming back to the other three you
wake up a little late given that it was
a late night
you have a you have a driver who has
been
assigned to you all right some english
why don't maybe alex and i can go make
sure she gets some proper armaments
for both of our sanities
[Laughter]
um so that actually when you
wake up in the morning
lovely knives but they're not you know
these are these are almost like
um the japanese like
where the hilt is almost as long as the
blade right
um they're not as they're not as
concealable
as you like yeah but they're they're
you know
any blade in a storm at a certain point
and donald keeps his mouth shut when he
yeah probably smart yeah alexandra will
pick that up and like turn them over and
over
like i mean the blades are very nice
but they're just not what you use well
i reckon they'll do and you know they
fold the steel like
like 20 times or something that's
supposed to be
really sharp
and i'll hold it up and like prick the
the the pad of my thumb
that is a very sharp blade they are very
sharp
that's good it's just a hell of a lot of
one end though isn't it
only one end yeah it's not it's not
these are these are knives not daggers
well i can make it work
until such time as i get what i'm used
to and emma you have a katana now for
drunk sword fighting
the guard on the lord the guard's too
large you can see what
it looks like too yeah i'm not going to
be able to be uh
as concealed with these as i like but
we can still find you something better
we can still keep looking
i don't think that we're going to find
italian stilettos
in japan and i know they do have those
kind of
pointy things with the guards i don't
know what they call those
they're they're not going to be the
right shape i can make these
work yeah
psy are not slicing weapons at all they
are punctured
well but so are stilettos technically
i think today we should also go and see
somebody
maybe pick up professor lam and go see
somebody who maybe has
um either geology or has um
not excavated but like what's
you know explored the island and
done drawings more research
upgrade dragon island specifically yeah
like where is stanford's hideout
you know so they remember taro had a
map
okay like that the whole island is
basically
um empty and then there's a cave in the
mountain at the top of it
okay our best option
it looks like is to gun
or bomb the top and get rid of the
karasiri and the flesh tank and
and alexander will pause this point and
go
flash tank they got a flesh
they got a flesh tank because a tank was
there and then a bunch of dead bodies do
you think
that they have a flesh destroyer yet
probably
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's not
it's not a it's a it's above our pay
grade we can't deal with this
uh the japanese can land on all their
troops bring all their boats and
they'll they'll do what they gotta do
don't put the troops on
the beaches don't do anything until you
gun
the karasiri off of the beaches and the
flesh tank for preference
i'm just saying drop some grenades onto
a flesh destroyer
sink it you're not wrong
you're not wrong and that's the worst
part
you know i've been an airplane before
and that didn't go so well for me either
so
[Laughter]
yeah you were in buy next oops we lost
somebody
that could be around you you were in one
airplane
can they do that to five 10 100
we just want to give amy the full like
uh uh
obs experience now yeah just all the
things
just just yell for thomas make him deal
with him he's outside with the dog right
now
ah well so yeah you are um
you know you so you three you have a
driver like i said
uh is are you just gonna hang around
the house during the day
clothes expensive sake um
what else do i want i i honestly want
clothes too because everything that i'm
wearing is made for someone a foot
taller than me
sure yeah you can you can get some very
nice clothes
um and you notice that the driver
is paying for everything oh good
because we don't mean we don't have any
yen
what are we gonna use to buy it who's
picking up the tab though
of the japanese government apparently we
were going to owe a debt to
but i'm appropriately clothed in things
that actually fit me so
i'm not going to look a gift horse in
do we go talk to joan lamb yeah we can
or we can go to a bakery and try and get
them to
make my dog a cake why would you get
them to make your dog
why not these are things
i need i need to have double mattresses
fancy clothes dog gets a cake and
there's futons i don't know if it does
any good stacking them up like that
it helps a lot i mean for a happy
happy happy dog giving day right yeah i
mean her her bed looked
very comfortable just throwing that out
there you know it's emma's safe
emma's just because you're saving the
world doesn't mean you can't have some
luxury
exactly why am i not at the savoy right
now i don't know
i should try one of those bats out of
those those japanese bats are supposed
to be very relaxing
actually i was thinking about getting a
massage but i don't i don't know if
we've got time for that
hi nick welcome back all right so right
now nick is donald
donald is hollister i think that's the
only people i have to like fix
okay cool i'm still me yeah you're still
you cool
take this shotgun take it take the
shotgun no
i don't want this shotgun you need a
shotgun
no magic is bad stop using it
right for the next year for the
halloween episode we're all going to
switch characters
yes you've got this yeah you can play me
okay who who wants alexandria to stab
everything totally i would totally do
that
i can't let amy use a crowbar
why do you think i've gone to explosives
nothing bad ever happens with those
i'll take hollister's role no no no we
give everything to the us governments
keep nothing for anyone else
for yourself uh
i'll be emma he gets paid for it it's
burning
oh no everything's on fire [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
be ezra make a roll i need to see what
the gorilla is talking but you know
i'll make you an offer i'll make you an
offer yes that's the other one
the sound the the the phrase that makes
me just automatically say oh gods
uh cavalry door number two
so after some after a pretty woman
montage uh
you guys head to the embassy i guess to
me
uh lamb hollister all right
um there are some weird looks when a
japanese car
you know and a japanese attache pulls up
and you are shown in to uh
the the suite where hollister and lam
hi good morning good morning
joan yeah i've had my coffee i'm i'm
okay yeah you got some coffee question
yes please and stanford showed up last
night
what that was the paper bitey things
that that's a whole other long story
let's not talk about the game
i don't know if i can deal with that
right now but but stanford so what did
he want
he wanted us to go away i'm going to be
pope
and donald's going and donald's going to
be a lord of ireland
you're going to be oh he said oh
man he didn't offer us anything i
okay most importantly if we don't take
the deal does that mean
he kills joan i doubt it
so what if we don't take the deal am i
still pope
is that the punishment i feel i feel
like being pope is more of a punishment
than yeah me too yeah
yeah yeah i don't know if that would
work but um
wow oh so he how did he mean did
astral projection i mean how did he how
did he visit you
no there was a spider door ew
dug into the guards that were at our
location
holy crap yeah we have those spider
doors tend to go through bodies we got
to get that guy
we can't do anything unless we get that
guy he's planning to come back tonight
so what do we do kill him
i'm in favor i don't know if it's
possible
i don't know i don't have any spells for
that he's every bit as human as
pinhue was as gavigan was as all of
these
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we have dealt with he is
still human for all that he claims to be
omniscient and having seen the future in
some
shakespeare phone thing what what
don't what what they call you and talk
about shakespeare what
i don't know i still have a ton of
poison left
it's true and it doesn't matter what
magical barrier you use
poison if you have to breathe it's gonna
get through yeah
if i roll a grenade could we stab him
with poison
um well if he has a magical barrier
no can i roll a grenade under his feet
not a magical barrier though that would
it would keep everything physical out so
how would you get poison into him
the thing the thing that struck me in
the air the thing that struck me the
most
guys is that he was coming offering
mercy he said that we have thrown off
his plans enough that the ritual can't
happen
the ritual you mean the the the captain
no the eclipse ritual oh i think it's
still very important for us to go to
great dragon island and do something
about
this well what i i agree i agree we
should go to grave dragon island
and try to look less suspicious over
there nick what is what is
this when you say this you're just
talking about a little bit of this and a
little bit of that like what's this
hello fellow kids
are are you talking about the radiation
or whatever the hell they're talking
about over there
oh it's the oh i mean the weapon the
weapon he's going to use
a weapon weapon the island full of
monsters
with all the magic and let's learn about
the monsters we've dealt with those
hold on i mean the flesh tank
is there something more than the flesh
tank
there was something that he referenced
that that he said had to do with
radiation
uh and taro mentioned mary curry he said
the island would be oh are are
any of you good with mechanics no
no well i
i can't fully make out what it is just
that it's been referred to repeatedly
as as a mega weapon but when they say
mary curie
uh hollister you you know enough about
uh chemistry and stuff to know about her
research and how
she died of radiation poisoning after
exposure to
you know what they found out was
okay but i i
i know i wouldn't see how to make that a
super weapon
right yeah this would be like makes
we donald and i saw something in
penhue's boat
something that was i don't know maybe a
big is this about right
ezra about yeah big yeah about about yea
big
glowing green that was in the boiler it
made the ship
the vessel very fast and
when i saw it i got desperately ill very
quickly
and you also recall that his boat blew
up very well
with lots of green flames
that wasn't mine unfortunately no that
that was that was their trap set for us
yes the the problem
is and maybe this is my trouble with
understanding the weapon
is i can't tell where the technology
starts and the magic
ends you're probably right the magical
weapon like
you've told me stories about emma and
london
which stories about yeah i was like what
did i do now
supposedly in another another world
another life
something there was a box in london that
that story
we've been told several times it it was
it wasn't well for a start it wasn't
green yeah and i just
smashed through it trying to get into it
and the next thing you know
i'm floating in space the black pharaoh
said
if i remember correctly that it was a
very finely tuned machine
and hidden it with a crowbar made things
go off rather sooner than
intended but you also recall that it was
being shipped to
china are we dealing with something like
that here it's another weapon
like that it's entirely possible but
but if that's the case it's something
mechanical
or magical i mean it's definitely
i'll all roll out the blueprints
yeah so he's got he rolls out these
blueprints that
might as well be greek tomorrow right i
just like look at them and go
you can make a mechanical repair roll
i'm going to try
yeah as well why the hell not oh
let's try it no
no no heads or tails 47. doesn't look
like anything to me
did you just spill coffee on the
blueprints ought six
oh wow okay oh my god um
so yeah this is some sort of
bomb that um
that has an engine so it's a bomb with
propulsion
that doesn't make any sense bombs don't
do that do they
i mean what's the point if you drop them
can you can you
steer them or you could build the plane
into it but then you're wasting a plane
but it's if it's not piloted that's
worth it
who who cares the bombs what matters
what if what if you could wow what if
you could launch that
from somewhere else like an airplane
yeah it was like an airplane like it
would be like a
bomb you put on an airplane and
transport over and drop
i don't see them but what if well what
if you don't need the airplane
what if it's just an engine pointed in
that direction wherever it needs to go
there's no person involved you just
shoot it in that what if it's a spider
portal that you push it through
i'm still more concerned about the bomb
tell us who gets the bomb
well okay so japan wants to go over
and they were talking about
you know take going over and taking over
do we want them to do that or we just
want to blow the crap out of it
if they take over the island they'll get
whatever is being built there
and i'm sorry hollister i'm sure you
don't agree
no one should get that unless
everybody has it no one should i would
no
no i would prefer that no one has it if
if it's a decision between everyone and
no one
honestly yeah yeah yeah i agree i i
would prefer i mean
donald knows war is hell and that's just
the the little localized [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that
happened in ireland and all that
that sort of thing i'm gonna make it i'm
gonna make it clear that i have my
orders
to try to obtain this i will
do my best but i don't think it's
something that's realistically within my
power
and if something needs to happen this
bomb so it doesn't fall in the wrong
hands
i'm not going to personally lose any
sleep honestly i think
i i think hollister that any hands would
be the wrong hands with this thing
i agree and right now stanford has all
the power because he's the only person
with this weapon
and everybody wants it which gives him
leverage at this point
so unless there's another equally
forceful power that has it to combat him
and to keep him in check nobody nobody
can get it
i'm just being upfront with what my
orders are what happens if snapper makes
a deal like he's trying to deal with us
with who who would he make the deal with
a nation
japan or america he wants to be
emperor of the entire goddamn world why
would he's not going to make it any
country
well don't forget that he has the
and his weapon lives he who knows what
he'll do in the future
i honestly think that you're so it's
time
to make some poison your
your orders make sense if we're thinking
from an american-centric point of view
but from a worldwide perspective i don't
think anyone should have this thing
well i work for america
should you
do i mean have we really done justice by
american standards
really
i just sit back i'm listening i
i have seen what or at least the tail
end of the british imperial
side of things i don't want america to
become an imperial power i don't want
japan to become an imperial power
not really not one that actually has an
empire this is something that should be
cut off at the root
how how do we do that we destroy the
emma oh done
see steve there's there's complications
again and you just spelled them out yeah
but we do need one of these militaries
to get us there we
can't reach that island
if if if we can get it so that one of
the militaries
uh guns down the karasiri and the flesh
tank on the surface of the island
and then we get a military force to push
into the bottom side of it
and then things exploded
that happens around the great dane
society
which basically but we're going to be
there
which means we have we betray whoever it
is that is getting us
there i'm just saying everybody knows
accidents happen why don't
we get both sides to go if we get both
of them to go
oh you're describing
us detonating it could be one of the
worst things that
could be suggested by anyone ever that's
right i was i was i was around this
green thing and it made me desperately
ill
like throwing up behind a staircase kind
of ill
so you're just saying we should steal it
and hide it somewhere
well i mean i'd almost say bottom of the
ocean sounds good
but but i actually wouldn't trust that
either
because apparently one of your reports
says that there's things at the bottom
of the ocean
when you say things at the bottom of the
ocean you mean just like
coral oh yeah i say it what all right so
this island how far away is it from any
other land mass
i can't remember ways away it is it is
pretty dense so if we blow
up the thing on this island and get away
it is potentially a universe destroying
bomb
well that's the thing though there is no
being far enough away
oh he said he said that what he was
building it for
stanford he said that what he was
building it for was to close the rift
that nara lethotep
where's that technically as a thought is
coming through
as a side that gnarly thought is calling
him through
yes but to close it but to close the
rift not to
open it further to close it but it must
be a weapon of immense power to do that
and if we were to sabotage it crowbar it
as it may that could be a terrible
consequence
is it terrible to close the rift i mean
what does stanford
have except being a magician after that
i don't know what i don't know it's like
if you're it's like if you're mining you
stick dynamite into the hole to make the
hole
bigger explosions don't close
things they do if you put them in a mine
and it closes a mine shaft
yeah but then what you're describing
is blowing up reality around the rift to
cause it to collapse in
explosions are power it's a lot of power
a lot of energy released all at once
what if that's what the rift needs in
order to knit itself closed
does that make any sense nope no but
none of this does
what if we just dismantle the damn thing
well let's listen
the
yeah just take the spark plugs they'll
never be able to start it
i don't know what what are we expecting
we can't get to the island without the
japanese or the americans and then
they'll have the bomb
i say we get them both out there
what are we doing
[Music]
i don't know killing stanford with
poison tonight
maybe i like that option me too if i'm
let's try that let's go that's that's
our first thing but we've got
i think i'll get started on that before
we can worry about anything else because
i'm on a timetable
i've gotten some stuff here but are you
gonna make poison
in the american embassy i mean
i brought poison with me from scarab
betty yeah and i have other stuff too
i might need to shop for some more
again chemicals and compounds yes the
answer to your question was yes
all right yes i would be concocting
something within the american embassy
that is very poisonous and deadly to
people do they have explosions i mean do
they have grenades here
no it may shock you to learn they do not
have grenades at the american embassy
what cracked out place is this
um a fairly safe one
yeah i feel pretty safe here
um okay so
make me a is anyone gonna hang around
while he makes poison
of course no
uh so are you all going back to the
compound what are you doing
let's go back to the compound that's the
safest place we could be
no i i i'm gonna take me up later
i was gonna stay here did you want me to
go holly
i mean i'm not going to pretend that
this is
without risk and that
i will need a fan and the open window we
will need a well ventilated area
oh no we don't want this evaporating
into the air
i'm not bad at this dice
nice be good to me we have inspiration
so i'm gonna put out there right away
right not quite a hard success success
all right so yeah you have made a
sufficient amount you believe of
poisonous liquid that will
cause uh
it was get you made gas right you you
this will like so
i mean if to kind of be fancy pants what
i would try to do
is get something that i could pressurize
so that it's a liquid but then when i
spray it and it
is in the air then it starts to
evaporate instantly
or close to instantly sure yeah you made
a good role so you make a
yeah you make a fair amount of that
you have enough you have more than
enough to kill a person so
you need a perfume spritzer to do an
atomizer oh i've still got
i've still got the canister from
scaravetti ah okay cause i was gonna say
i could i'll give you an atomizer
i got one of those now we just need
someone who knows how to aim this
properly donald's out of the question
because i know he's just gonna spray me
uh all right so emma are you doing
anything else before your
apparently midnight assault on carl
stanford uh
we should probably talk sure are we
getting a
are we getting transportation to the
embassy to the to the
compound tell us where you are at right
yeah that would left the message where
the compounds at
the driver will come and get you the
japanese driver will come and get you
all right oh donald and
i need to talk here no talk to alex
probably all right
for sure what's up
uh this is before that's all stanford
things even right
uh unless i i'd have to say that i
didn't i didn't tell you about the
cottage
or when we were talking about africa or
a couple years
i left a couple things out yes i i
didn't want to bring it up but this
seemed very
presumptuous of me so i thought when
this whole thing was over you know don't
when we finished this whole thing i'd
so i was surprised that the bastard
brought the whole
mess up i apologizing
assuming we survived this whole mess yes
that's that's that's the thing listen um
one of these two governments is going to
take this super weapon that's nothing to
do with us
not necessarily we can break it how
we're going to break it up we can't go
on the beach
we've got to betray whoever it is that
captures it and then survive
that betrayal we've managed so far
what are we doing listen if we leave
stanford alone he's going to seal the
breach
or the japanese of the americans will
take the weapon from him one of these
three things will happen
i don't know i i feel like this is above
us i know that we've been these
traipsing around the world looking at
these mysteries
and saw sealing pyramids and whatnot and
getting
getting you killed in the process
at this point i feel like what are we
what are we doing
what are we really doing here i mean
hollister is going to make sure the
americans take it or flint's going to
make sure the japanese take it
and we're going to have to pick a side
here love or just pick no
sides maybe we can
clean up the mess afterwards i don't
know i had to feel like we're
either choice we make was the wrong
choice
i mean when it comes just into saving
the world is there a right choice
how are we saving the world here and
what scenario do we save
the world in whichever scenario stanford
came to talk to us to try and break us
out of
i think something happens in the future
and we
he could he could have tried to kill us
and listen maybe we'll
maybe we'll kill him tonight and it
won't matter then the japanese can have
his bomb
right maybe
we should be still in the breach at that
point
see then the breach would be a very good
thing
i can't do it i can't do that ritual
again
so you don't have to i don't
i don't have i don't have nida chris
tied to me this time i can do it
you can't do it alone it's i don't
have to do it alone i can get
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hollister to help me i can get
the japanese whoever they're sending to
help
if joan teaches them to do it the
japanese can do the ritual
they can use their own life force or
whatever it is they'll do the ritual
joan can't do it mmi we're almost
drained to nothing and hollister he
wouldn't
do the damn ritual if he made him he put
you're the only one but you can't do it
alone let the japanese
do it there it will train them
they can steal the bomb they can seal
the thing
and we can retire from all this mess i
should have
two years ago i tried it i almost was
out
you were with the philharmonic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
jackson line i said to die
i said i don't i don't darling you had
to know we'd get dragged back in
i don't know i didn't have to know he
just
they killed him they murdered him in his
and then we
killed a police officer and that was the
end of things i was
i was done after peru
we couldn't just forget but we did i did
i'm glad you could i left that behind
for i'm glad you were able to forget
what i'm saying anytime i opened my
mouth when i could talk
but you i don't know
i had a life once
before all this happened maybe this is
it i don't know i
i don't i can make a choice here what
stanford is afraid
of us of you
so you think when i'm i'm the one to
shoot him maybe
i can't stop thinking about the fact
that he didn't offer me anything
he offered emma and he offered you
now maybe now maybe he knew that
you would pull me into
sure anyone who knows us would know us
at that point
but he knows there's nothing he can
offer you there's nothing he could offer
you
that you would tag
not
and that means something are important
in this tunnel you're not just a gun you
can try to
degrade yourself that way all you like
but you are not just a gun any more than
i'm just a knife
you're a constant whatever the hell that
is and
joan does the magical thing in hollywood
joan is a constant emma is a constant i
am a constant
but he did not offer something to them
he offered something to you
i'm just a trigger mom
anybody else can pull a trigger who can
stand in the face of something
world ending and keep their hands steady
enough to pull that trigger
it's getting a lot shakier lately maybe
but when it's but when it needs to be
and maybe it's because you're standing
next to me
and that's fine if that's the motivation
that you need love then that's the
motivation i'll give you
stand next to me well
um i'm not going anywhere if that's
that's the case i'm not going
without you so if that's the case
i'll i'll be here i'll
i watched a universe die
i didn't see the people die but i saw
the result
of it and i saw that world go dark
i can't watch that happen again
if there is anything in this world that
i can do to stand against it then i will
i'm not going anywhere so and don't
that that that scene like closes with
like
him saying no worries with a
thousand-yard stare as he like you know
what
lots of worries love lots of worries um
i i think that's a fantastic note to end
on
uh so we'll we'll start next episode
with
a another wanton poisoning of you
know
of a human being by our heroes
but denver doesn't count as human
anymore
but what's up what's our notes for this
one yes
uh let's see they obviously frown on
explosives in this town
well i got the streisand filter going
again idiots
[Laughter]
i'm like i look so much younger
um do we have a plan of course not
the tape worm from hell
we were thinking what we always think
explosives
we try all the time we just don't try
successfully i like that one a lot
that's good yeah that's a good one
i've got a day to fight biting i've got
a dog to fight bitey paper
if i can't have explosives i'm gonna
have an attack dog
monkeys can swim that's a that's a
that's an underrated one
uh maybe we maybe we invent the
shakespeare phone we screw it up like we
always do
maybe you're more than a knife bungle up
the future
that's what we do there's a theme
through there
i enjoyed when joan was called a pack
rat of knowledge
yes it works better with the thumb
pointing but i'm gonna be pope
um i i think this is my leader in the
clubhouse
i can't tell where the magic starts and
the technology ends
i like that one who gets the bomb
question mark that's a title
yeah any hands would be the wrong hands
that's a good one
uh another possum another strong
possibility crowbar
emma uh
everybody knows accidents happen that
was
ominous and explosions don't close
things i don't know i i'm
i really like i can't tell where
the magic starts and the technology ends
i'm a fan of that
