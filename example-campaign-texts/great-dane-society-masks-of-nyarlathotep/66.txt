the beginning just to warn everybody
because we
we have to deal with the the elephant
and oh hey
hello internet friends
speaking of weird tones hello
internet friends
thank you so much welcome to quests and
chaos thank you so much for spending
part of your geek end with
us i'm just going to say it right out
you can notice we are diminished
um we are down a dane unfortunately
this is a good reminder that we all are
very lucky
in that we can spend our saturdays
having fun
and burning three hours of of the
evening
to enjoy this game and not everybody has
that privilege
and unfortunately tom who is a
huge part of everything that we have
done here
uh has real life responsibilities that
are going to keep him
from finishing out this game tom will
not be able to join us anymore on
saturdays
and it's it's a bummer but
all you can do is keep going forward
um there everything's fine it's just
he has a conflict on saturdays
that cannot be that he can't get
rid of
uh it's you know it's like i said it's a
good reminder that
we are all parents we are all partners
we are all
uh there are we all have jobs there are
things that
sometimes take re take precedence
and real life always takes precedence uh
tom is an old friend of mine this is not
the last time that i will sit at a table
virtual or otherwise
and play games with him and i have a
feeling knowing tom as i do this is not
the last time that we will all
sit at a table virtual or otherwise and
play games with tom
uh he remains a huge part of the story
that we've told
and frankly he was also instrumental
in the decisions that we made for the
stories that we're going to tell
ironically enough
so he will he will
uh he and his characters will live on uh
and really he's gonna live on let's be
clear
but unfortunately he will not be joining
us on saturdays um
yeah so that out of the way
uh we have just a few quick
announcements to go through i want to

what's happening come in here he's like
you you have like you do the bits in an
excel spray is there a formula what is

it the better
uh that will be the first of what we
what are gonna be
all sorts of new patreon perks thomas
is like thomas is that guy at the the
meme from the chalkboard with all the
weird math stuff on it as he's like
charlie he has a name oh yeah from sunny
it's always sunny in philadelphia yeah
oh all right well there you go and the
pepe sylvia conspiracy
oh of course of course you've seen this
is that the guy who's slapping
the red bull the red string board yeah i
think yeah yeah but uh
but that's as thomas is thinking of
all sorts of patreon uh
incentives and also he's re-examining
how bits work and how bits
impact the games and things like that um
and
he sent out a couple surveys because we
want we always want feedback from you
the community
about how this works and about how
things are going you know
it's always good to check in on
long-term relationships
is that that time is that the official
call out for bids
uh well hold on i have to do the
calendar you know
we've got a full week of quest even with
thanksgiving
which by the way please stay home
please don't go spend don't don't go
be around 20 people be safe stay home
the sooner that we can all get through
this the sooner we can all be back in
the studio
playing games together but
uh monday dragon of ice spire peak uh
i i didn't notice until they pointed it
out in the newsletter or or
the announcement about james doing that
charity thing today but james
apparently only gm's things that have to
so he's getting curious to me because as
far as i know he's a california boy
yeah i know yeah yeah he's not a big fan
i'm so
you know we have to find i'm trying to
think of like an old school d d
module that had to do with with
winter that he can uh
uh that he can cover but so yeah
uh monday dragon of ice fire peak uh
i've
i'm on record i love james i think he's
a great gm i have fun
watching that and some people you might
recognize you know
are are playing in that game it covered
us with poo
we'll be fair he didn't cover us with
poo
he left the pooh there and made us cover
ourselves in it
is that better or worse of course and i
love it
it's your fault then it's not good i
don't think it is
and i'm given to understand i haven't
seen the last episode but i'm given to
understand that there was some violence
towards muffins which i am 100
on board with kill those sad cupcakes
uh tuesday the chaos agents continue
their their rumble through the uh
through thomas's
beaver journal high school journal
entries about the world of mage haven
this is like you know this is all
the world building that he did back then
finally coming to fruition
and then saturday it's our double header
uh
in the morning the other winter one the
name of which i'm forgetting rhyme of
the frost maiden that's what it is
uh rhyme of the frost maiden james james
and tossy and and honestly
james and tossy together is just always
good
like any time you get those two together
wacky things are happening
you have to join the discord for that
because there's like tossy says
something that thing he thinks is
hilarious and then makes the subtext
joke
in the chat i was like yeah we kind of
all got it
like we got the subtext here you didn't
have to point it out like you didn't
have to do that that's what she said in
the chat after you made the joke
i'm i'm just impressed with how tossy
cause like
i'm not a smart man i ca i can barely
keep track of the chat
and still actually run a game much less
actually play
and try and be in the moment and all
that stuff but he's like all over it
he's like
interacting with people in the chat as
he's playing i think he's actually like
streaming his own camera of himself
playing as he's
oh he should do that on his channel that
would be cool the second screen
experience
uh he can like turn and do like takes on
this side
behind the scenes bts that idea is yours
free
uh so first rhyme of the frost maiden
and then we are back here the great dane
society
uh with you know one of the last
episodes of this year
it's it's getting down to it
uh bef so let's watch amy do math
ooh good best part of my day also worst
part of my day
where shall i start let's
congratulate j matthews 85
on his new job let's not congratulate
ezra for getting bits out of that
experience
though so we have 2500 bits
there's math blah blah blah that's five
that's five bits
i'm sorry twenty five thousand two
thousand five hundred bits
two thousand five hundred is five
yeah one two three four five so we each
get one
right it's a good thing it's a good
thing you married well because woof
man yeah so so four of them go to the
four go to the players and one to the dm
that's
how i'm assuming math works no wait no
they all go to me
no they don't yeah he's he getting 2500
and it's he's giving me one for each
player
oh no well then the math is wrong
because there's only four players
ah well he he might not have caught up
with the announcements when he was doing
it
oh yeah can i can i protest that no
uh 25 i'm gonna and i quote
2500 to ezra one for each player
do with them what you will see i'm going
to quote this my own way
english language for you hold on i'm not
sure that like
pre comments can be titles of episodes
they can
as well as long as it's on stream it
counts it's on stream yeah 2 500 bits
to ezra one for each player
ezra one for each player yeah there you
go that works
oh man now you know i don't know how i
get through the i don't know how i get
through the world
i really don't with as much chaos and
alcohol as possible
yeah don't tell the police okay so we
had four
i believe he also threw the players a
little something after all of your
frankly kind of kind of
of course we whine it's part of the
bleeding it's part of the bit
oh no that was tamago torah yeah
somebody else
tamagotora i'm gonna put all of it
together so tamagoto gave 500 to burn
something down
don't worry i got you bro and then
500 to the lowest sand so
actually who is that not me
anymore that might be emma
i mean i've not even 34. i'm at 44.
i'm at 52. everyone looks down
no no i'm it i got mine i got a bunch
back
i met 51. one oh my god
is the lowest what the hell am i doing
jesus
well i mean running the game long enough
and then letting us do skill checks that
we're good at
why'd you allow why'd you allow a
therapist
in chat jay matthews said there were
things move fast around here it got to
keep running
you never know what might be catching
you up very pratchett reference for
y'all

ezra in which case we don't want to know

is awesome thank you all so much
it means a ton it really does and
uh i also you know i also always want
to shout out
my favorite twitch user our patron the
baroness
and it occurs to me i forgot to mention
the official dice
of the great dane society birds of
paradise
huh they must be mentioned we've got to
get the birds of paradise out there
i was going to say ezra with his
pretender birds of paradise over
there i got
i got that no these are real these are
birds apparently
i'm giving you crap because i have the
prototypes of of the actual birds of
paradise
i i have many many sets of birds
of paradise coming my way
thanks to the game yep yep
uh all right so there you go
uh we are in japan
and i want to
you had a plan you were meeting stanford
the next day
uh with a scheme to poison him
um you are in a different house than
you were you were moved there so
last episode japan uh
things went tragically awry carl
stanford showed up in the house that
some of you were staying in
others of you were not and he made
you an offer
he suggested all of these he would give
many of you gifts to
go away i've tried it it doesn't work
and it that that's what the bits
are for really they just keep hoping
we'll go away and we never do
they're like maybe if we keep giving um
and they decided they were going to
uh
try another bout of poisoning as dr
hollister realized that he still had a
fair amount of uh
uh of the materials needed to uh
poison someone
and they they also did we get
then yeah we got alexandra knives and we
got emma a katana
and you met with flint and started to
probably nail down the help of the
japanese military
but oh yeah sorry one other thing we
need to mention
j matthews also gave away gift subs to
trigger a sub giveaway
that sounds like a convention you should
not go to seriously
especially or like a bad like
a bad disaster movie yes
subplusion
so thank you so much for the
subscriptions i don't remember what
happens is is a subscription give away a
nord games
something we'll find out hashtag
the break and you'll get something who
knows what you know what it's uh
another copy of the call of cthulhu
coloring book i will throw out another
copy of the
uh pdf copy where is that where's that
from
uh rpg drive-through rpg okay
yeah and pdf means that anyone in the
world can win that
that's true it is open to our friends in
canada
even quebec even come back we'll let you
spread this time
right there's some sort of law actually
preventing it
because email does attachments don't go
to quebec yeah
they know what they did they're they're
all they they
only if they're in french and
uh unfortunately the knives alexandra
got were not her usual
they were actual knives not daggers yeah
um
which is you know she's gonna get used
to that but uh
we also found out that alexandra did
not remember
anything that happened from the time
that she
died until she was reconstituted
in in africa birthed anew
out of hypatia masters didn't even
remember that part i don't remember
anything until i woke up in tokyo
that's true you were yeah you were you
were out the whole time don't come do
you best you don't remember coming out
of that lady
yeah that's true lady i mean
there's trauma both directions i
remember dying
or remember being born
there's trauma in all directions there
yeah that's it
trauma in all directions i like that
yeah that is actually that is a good one
so we're going to
start
june 24th i believe where are we at
uh june 24th yeah we came
into june 24th yeah so it's the the
all during the day of june 24th you're
dealt with stuff you're getting knives
and you dealt with setting up
the day of girls
on the plus side we're back to an
all-female cast on the minus cell
there's only three of them it's
we do what we can so
uh yeah you you're gonna spin you
spend the 24th prepping the poison plan
whatever it may be we'll find out and
that sort of thing um
alexandra you wake up and
because you are always aware of
everything around you you realize that
there's
sit up like and there is a note
on the pillow
okay and for the benefit of our
listeners
all right i will sit up in bed and
uh pick up the letter and open it i
recognize the handwriting immediately
i'm sure
madame linz her handwriting is much
nicer
even even you know imagine even an ape
alexandria i am sorry that i couldn't do
this
i am a coward perhaps i tried to find
the words in person
but i couldn't i really don't care about
stanford
and which country gets his bomb we
stopped the incursion
found out about the carlisle expedition
stopped them all
when i got you back i knew that i
couldn't see you die again
watch you throw yourself into harm again
and again
and that's a problem that i don't know
there's something about africa i didn't
tell you
when we spoke to the wise man he told me
this
that i loved you more than you loved me
it's true i know you'll deny it but it's
true
you love the mission you'll throw
yourself into danger without a thought
you'll give your life for these people
emma and the rest of them
also without a thought me i care [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
all about that
i care about you and that gets in the
way of the mission
what i wanted to ask you last night was
this
i wanted to ask you to run away with me
to give it all up
and i didn't ask because i knew what the
answer would be
but either answer would be a problem for
you
so how can i ask you to choose
so this is the way it needs to be
i'm going you know where to find me
i've written it down on the back of this
note
when you feel like your mission is done
when your heart tells you that it's time
i'll be there
however long it takes i will wait for
you
i hope that you'll forgive me i hope
that you'll understand
i hope that i will see you again someday
i want to thank tom for his his last
contribution
to our game that was uh
as good a way as you can write off a
character without ending a world
as anybody can do uh
and so you
you have that note and on the back is
the address
of that little cottage on the coast
that he received from old bundari
and donald
has left almost all of his belongings
here
did he take the rifle with him of course
sit on the the edge of the bed just
reading over the
the letter four five six times just
trying to make sense of it all
trying to
and finally i stand up and fold
up the letter carefully and slip it into
my pocket
and just
cold
because if i let myself think too much
so i'll step out into the main area and
look for emma yeah everybody is
yeah come and sit down
immediately pick up i don't know if i
don't know if there's coffee here but
i'm drinking whatever caffeinated
beverages around
there's plenty of how good the coffee is
in japan at this time
yeah but it's mostly tea
yeah i'll pick up pick up the a cup of
tea and just
nod to everyone if you were at the u.s
embassy the coffee would be better
well hollister's enjoying coffee in a
donut right now
are we all gathering are we all gathered
now or is it just me and emma right now
i thought we all went because after the
poison we all agreed to go to the scene
that's right
yeah you're all at the same house yeah
yeah
so he's not enjoying a coffee and a
donut right now poor bastard
nope sacrifices i make
you're still gonna pour milk in it
though just to see if it uh
makes it better if it's green tea no
cream
i'm gonna pour cream in it okay sugar
and cream
in green tea are you mad
i look at it and try it a little bit and
i'm like
he's bourbon yeah it does it
needs a little shot of something irish
green doctor
how are we poisoning stanford again how
is this supposed to work
got a canister wait do we need to we
need to wait for donald to come out
we could so we can all talk about it
yeah sure i mean we can wait i mean
where is he he's gone
what with the poison you mean or to get
more ammunition
he left he left left like
like goodbye left like
disappearing and showing up at some
the cottage got him
i think i was like that is possible joan
i mean
sounds like we've got a plane to catch
or not what or it's the return of baba
yaga
so he just left he just took his stuff
and left well not he left most of his
stuff here
took the rifle but most of the other
guns are still here
we need him we needed him yeah
he was sorry
don't mean to be insensitive he was
really oh during your well if it wasn't
for if it wasn't for alexandria being
around he would have snapped a long time
ago
that makes sense do you talk about all
of us like this in front of each other
i'm just saying we shouldn't go after
him
we're not no no
we can't we should not this is
a grown-ass selfish bastard man right
now
yeah oh god i wish you could have waited
till we were done we were almost done
we're almost done right we've almost got
the capstone we've almost got everything
done
as far as he's concerned he has done he
has done what he said he would do
carlyle expedition stopped the what's
what the ritual is going to be
as far as he's concerned he's done and
apparently he couldn't watch me throw
myself into this again and again so
here we are and a part of me is
very tempted to go after him and prove
there's more at stake there's so
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] much more at stake than all of
cut down i'm so sorry i i'm i'm glad we
we need to finish we need to finish
i keep losing the things that i care
about and i'm really
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick of it but
we're going to finish this we're going
to see this through
and then i'm going to go and disappear
and i'm not gonna let the one person
that i've loved in this world
disappear if there's any way that i can
help it
but when this is over and who knows we
might not survive this it might not be a
question at all
and if so i'm very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] angry at him
for not at least having the courage to
holly talk to her i don't know what to
say it is distinctly on english
of me to be so very emotional
i'm going to see this root at the end
we'll be there for you we'll be there
and i'm going to try to not let stupid
emotions
get in the way of all of this because we
have a job to do we have a stanford
poison there you go
there now we have something to focus on
so oh don't look at me like that
hollister
all right so let's get back to the plans
what are we gonna do so stanford had
said that he would return
sometime today now
uh
who needs to roll dice you were at a
different house
when he was around so you're not sure
how that's going to work out
yeah oh are we not intentionally going
back to the same places before
oh you totally could he he found us
there before i have absolutely no doubt
actions are set up here yeah here the
yeah protections are still here here all
of the the
the the spells are still active so he
might not be able to find you
yeah so we we might want to go back to
the
original place right from there um
and it's basically just like the the
poison is just like putting out a fire
he's the fire spray him with the poison
like what you did with scary betting
yep oh it's a little different it'll
it'll come out as liquid and then
evaporate if you splash any around
you
hold your breath and move back
i suppose that does beg the question
um donald was going to be the one
i imagine i'm the one stepping up into
those
good
he left his guns behind most of them not
his security blanket of sorts um
but the rest of the guns are still there
so try not to shoot me in the back
but they're there to be used
yeah i'm not that good with a handgun
honestly got one so
is is this is the the specter sort of
still oh no that has been gone since
africa
since it was left in night chris for the
um so during the day uh
uh you're gonna meet with flint again
and start trying to figure out uh
what your plan is in terms of grey
dragon island because
um the japanese military is gonna need
some lead time
uh in terms of you know what what day
are you thinking of
they should be there let me
pull up my calendar here so that i can
look at it because
you should really just have the cool
print out one that uh
julie made yes with the crosses on and
everything
so we are going to the next
full moon the next full moon
is july 6th
6th 6th
but i believe some of you were planning
on going to the island early
or you guys were maybe going to do some
reconnaissance or something yeah
yeah that's what we wanted to do i mean
are we
just worrying about today right now see
well we have to give them we have to
give them a heads up about when we want
to be there
i don't know if this will work yet
though and that's going to address if if
we take out stanford here and now
it changes everything if we don't well
i mean it'll it'll change whether or not
stanford is there
who knows what other creations are are
there besides
the kara siri and the flesh tank and
gods only know if he's you know managed
to make a flesh destroyer
if stanford has been taken out
i think we can be much more confident on
moving on the island
well so if you in your you know
flint will tell you that like
acting almost immediately for a naval
squadron
would be around the first the beginning
of july
right you know to get everything set and
to get
like enough soldiers and
ships ready to go in the in the way that
they want to do this
especially he's not even sure about
the aircraft carrier
so do we tell them that we want to get
there like
on the third or fourth we don't know yet
well we have to no we we can't know
until we see how this plan goes
but we'll know after today so we can get
things running today
and if everything goes terribly wrong we
still
uh though they'll they'll know to call
it off and if everything goes terribly
right
we still will not be able to get there
before the first if they start
mobilizing
right now you're going to get them to
burn through resources
getting them to mobilize again
afterwards is going to be slower and
more difficult
so they they think in terms of event
horizons
you know and like when when they need to
ramp stuff up
and so essentially within the next
three days
is there kind of you know we need to
know by then
to be able to get stuff ready well no in
so i think i think that we can wait
until tomorrow morning at the latest
do you want flint there when you poison
uh
let me find the other character she
who could who could who could who would
count as
killing flint if he gets poisoned
uh that's tricky if flint
is handling the poison and he's screwing
it up then that wouldn't count
and and that would count as suicide and
it wouldn't work yeah
it'd have to go or would it be the
person who made the poison
no that's like throwing a microwave in
the bathtub and saying whoever invented
the microwave is now a gorilla
or or shooting off a bomb and being like
the person who created the bomb was the
one who's actually
who'll actually do it i mean here's the
thing this is a monkey's paw
it wants to move around so the these
this curse
looks for loopholes no it doesn't there
no i spoke to the last guerrillas
and they desperately tried to get this
uh this to move around
and
they clearly didn't have access to
poison that was just or yeah you kind of
do want
flint to poison him like your dex is all
well and good
but he is one yeah my dex is great
your con is better no his dex is better
too
i mean fair mine's as good as the humans
can be almost
ridiculous yeah no that sounds
that sounds great i think it's great
flynn can just grab him and just
shove it in his mouth if he's like being
uncompliant
just just pump it down where did my
just do this just role play it like this
i look sad sad stash
where'd it go why no
it should be right there dude it should
be right
he just leaves it right hunting knife
but i don't have his mustache
why do you never mind yeah i guess it's
without the mustache there is no flint
oh
no
i really wanted to be like throwing
stuff over his shoulders
bunch of rubber chicken go flying
honestly the knife is for getting the
mustache off of the sticky stuff
ah there you go you make me so nervous
when you handle knives like that
always point them towards your face kids
and also don't listen to me ever
is that should i do up hold on i have to
i have to see it's evil flint
evil then it's just like that right
that's plenty that's flinty that's
he had to do over went when we before we
saw him jay matthews brings up a great
point
what if stanford kills flint before he's
poisoned
he turns into a gorilla that gets
poisoned
and then one of us will have to kill him
can gorillas do magic
yes i mean madame lin was doing stuff
the the magic user whole thing
ho fang was using magic as a yup yeah
umbrella
so yeah that's a good point jay matthews
i
really hate that you brought that up oh
what thank you for bringing that up jay
matthews i hate it
yes or tomorrow lindsay ls thing which
i've been watching a lot of lately
um all right so yeah what is your
um so you're gonna go back to the
non-protected house
i think that's a poor idea i think we
should just put like a spiritual
beacon out the front door like we are
here
i don't know how to do that joan you
probably know how
but can he come in if it's if it's if
it's well that's what i'm saying you
just pop out
of the of the force field exactly
i'm in i'm out i'm in i mean it's
unclear to you
whether the protection is just he can't
find you or whether it is
not be able to enter yeah we don't and
that's the thing if he can't enter
we can't get the poison to him right so
we're taking a risk if we stay
where we are you just put the nozzle out
the force field and just do this
why don't we ask why don't we ask our
hosts what exactly the range of the
protections are this is clearly
something that they've been that they've
you know perfected over however long
right yeah
dialogue from last time no i don't we're
there
they didn't they they were like oh maybe
we're not that good at that
they they don't know that's why the
reasons they're so desperate for the uh
for the that's why they want joan to
come and talk to them because
all of this is like folklore to them
right
and folklore is notoriously poor in
terms of
user manuals and so i'm going to tell
everybody right now since it brought up
with the with the magic stuff that said
i'm not
i'm i have my my books and things like
that they're
they're away but i am i am going to help
them
do this because yes we need to have the
safety signs with them
and might be cool
if they actually did the capstone ritual
for their own land
instead of us great dragon island isn't
really theirs
that's china great dragon island doesn't
really belong to anyone does it
it's the international waters it's
international
oh that i mean i could have an island
this gets better and better first off
i'm sleeping on two mattresses
now i can have an island your own island
oh man island of emma
and that is where the cult of emma lives
that's just on fire all the time all the
time
there's a volcanic island right
if it's kind of you know it's perfect
forever so so
so so anyway i just had that brilliant
idea because they really want to know
about this stuff
and so if i could give them just enough
well but
the capstone ritual is very specific
they can still extract more knowledge
from it potentially
i mean possibly but we need to get the
capstone
yeah when made yep that's fine we can do
that
i'm trying to remember ezra i think i
once upon a time
back back in in in weeks ago i thought
that i
that that i made a intelligence role
to be able to replicate
at least what it looks like i don't
remember though
uh yeah yeah you can i mean you've got a
rough
sketch of the of the jade idol
of the bloated woman so
i mean here's the thing if we clear that
island
or if we deal with stanford or both
we have time to experiment and
maybe we don't need to go to shanghai
and deal with madame lin to get the damn
statue
that would be preferable that would be
boy ain't she and if that's the case
then if we can clear the island
and i mean if it doesn't work on
the the the full moon we'll know i think
i mean i wasn't there for the last one i
don't remember how it went yes
it hasn't it hasn't yet
it didn't sound like there was no like
magical
like light shield or anything really the
only impact you
that anyone noticed was it made you sick
to be near it so you had to get far away
yeah well and i got far away in the
first place because i was like i'm in
the body of knight of chris i might have
literal evil no no might
yeah i am literal evil i need to be like
and even then i think you were well you
don't remember this but you were feeling
the pain
yeah was i well but the the but the
point is is that should
i have no objections it extracted a huge
cost from you
didn't it yes a lot of different
costs what happens though if this person
screws it up
try again next month i mean and
that's exactly it if we're able to clear
the island and keep it cleared
we have time yes we have until january
it's only june
yes we have exactly 203 days left
you just have some star blazers you just
time is very important to professor lam
yep
no she was alive for some of that i i i
was around for the beginning of it but
not really like seeing the full
so we've got to convince flint to kill
stanford
poison stanford i mean if
if he can just like grab him and hold
him and maybe
i mean all the casting that i've seen
he can but what if
you're not gonna have a lot of poison
in the area and you're gonna want to
leave regardless yeah
poisonous fumes and a stanford gorilla
yeah and madame lynn
yeah okay what if you die
i i still think that would be really
cool
yeah sorry hollister you could you cut
off a bit there
maybe
what happens if you ride flint
and kill stanford that way flint doesn't
die
you're protected by the big gorilla
there's poison i don't know how's that
feel
i liked it until that last sentence i
like how somehow
being protected by the big gorilla keeps
you from getting poisoned
i don't know it's lit will hold your
nose
i mean theoretically yeah i could cling
onto his back
and come up over his shoulder and dive
down on stanford and stab him but then
what's the point of the poison
put it in the hole put it in the stab
hole that's how it works
speaking of phrasing
speaking as someone who has created many
stab holes and poisoned a few people no
i just think that that flint has got the
power and
the resistance and and everything to be
able to do this
no that's true and and having it so i
mean
we've seen how powerful they are and as
long as flint isn't the one
honestly if if flint is is helping put
the poisons together then
he helped do it that might help close
that loophole
true because then it would be suicide
and that doesn't count
we can un i don't know no i don't i i
don't
i don't i don't don't deal i don't think
it counts as suicide and and honestly
i don't know the dosage to to take out a
gorilla that large
well good point good point i think it'll
be significantly more
than a human yes good point good point
can we get
flint some explosives as a plan b just
hear me out
so after the poison we put an explosive
bandolier thing on flint then if the
poison doesn't work
he's got to grab stanford pull the pin
boom
flint comes back problem solved
don't you remember how it messed him up
to remember falling and having every
bone in his body broken and then
back together yeah i don't think he
would agree to that
i'm not of course so i can't say
and but being a psychologist you might
be able to you wouldn't think
he would agree to that well and and
between the four of us
uh it messes you up mentally
to have stuff like that happen to you
and remember it
okay so we should try and keep flint
from killing himself
yes right if we don't want there to be
two
insane magic gorillas running around yes
all right i think we have if they hated
each other that would be even better and
would fight each other that would be the
best
i'd pay money for that i am a horrible
person i really want to set them both
loose
ah all right so we forgot what are we
doing what is our plan
make the poison get the gorilla get
stanford
we're going to go back to where you you
spoke with stanford
originally
yep there's no you're you're basically
gonna sit in the the that
that front room waiting yeah
set up an ambush hide flint under a
sheet or something
then he jumps out sprays them with
poison
all right or a lamp shade or something i
don't know we'll work it out
i think no lamp shading i think we
should put like um
the the ghillie suit type thing like the
bush material so we can just be like a
front lawn ornament like that like a
like a door jockey or whatever you just
reminded me of thomas and his ghillie
suit
the world's biggest lawn ornament that
was outstanding
makes me happy so yeah whatever
let me know how you wish to flint are
you okay with poisoning a
an insane evil sorcerer it's gonna save
the world absolutely
because like yeah absolutely i'm i'm
very concerned about
how much they want to run in there and
what stanford can do to them if we can
take him out without any casualties
i'm all right good all right
all right so yeah you you set up uh
flint you are
hiding i guess behind one of the paper
walls and you're just gonna come out and
grab him or
i'ma spray him with poison right you got
to come out of the wall first like the
kool-aid guy i mean i know it's not oh
yes poison oh
yeah yeah they don't sponsor us you're
going to come out of there like a love
a children's colored beverage a drink
you know not
the non-sponsored children if they want
us to mention them
they can pay for it that's all i'm
saying
oh yeah swelling swelling
yeah it's swell well aid is a is a
benefit concert i am not going to
so so yeah yes is going to start their
own
beverage now and we're going to
self-promote there you go
there you go as our empire uh
you know actually it's really just
thomas pouring five hour energy into
diluting down some to get more of that
money
today talking about sherlock holmes and
cocaine and equated it to five hour
energy drinks
uh so yeah it is about one in the
morning
when you hear a very familiar
behind you the paper wall
rips open and a spider
with stanford's head on it sticks uh
sticks its head out of the paper and it
says
i told you idiots i can see the future
the gorilla tries to kill me come on
if i wanted to be a gorilla right now
all i'd have to do is kill the gorilla
but i don't want to be a gorilla so go
ahead
poison this spider i've got thousands
more
i pull my sword and stab the spider head
what happens
uh you stab right through the spider
head in
it's kind of satisfying to slide right
through uh
uh stanford's head and the spider
like
its legs creep up and it goes all dead
bug and it is quite dead
darn okay so i poked his head again and
i was like did you see
that did you see that i
bet i would bet good money he did and he
said there's thousands more
oh i'm sure there's a spider somewhere
as i like fling spider goo off my off my
sword
oh please clean that properly
this flint like walking around like hey
flint
we're going spider squishing you want to
come
and then the door the door to the house
opens
and stanford walks in and he just stands
it's called a hologram you wouldn't
understand
it's hollow i said you wouldn't
understand i'm trying how kanye felt
is this like the the sherlock phone
or the shakespeare phone
yes it's again
any advanced technology to idiots like
you will seem like
magic so can we like do this
yeah i was about to say yeah you all
spend a
he like looks like there's a look of
sort of like
unhappiness you all spend about a minute
like running your hands through him
it's like it's like it's like radio
waves that we can see
how many fingers am i holding up i
knew they were gonna do this and it's
we live to please please
so i take it then this is your answer
i offer you everything you could ever
want
no no no we we that's a little insulting
you've already forgotten me in the
warehouse
there were five when i when i went to
the future
the irishman was trying to poison me
remember after i killed him got turned
into gorilla you were a hologram there
too
i jumped on you and tried to smash you
you forgotten me really
no no i yeah you'll get yours i don't
want to be a gorilla that's the only
reason you still live
hey stanford choices change things
donald made a choice and you and your
future doesn't work anymore
nice nice so how many fingers am i
so
my office my offer stands you can't
i could go find the irishman and bring
him back to you
i want your head on a pike it's right
over there and he points at the spider
your head so i can stand
look in my line of work
you only have a small amount of time to
really make an
impact on the world before someone comes
and the fact that this future has
changed
really concerns me
good because i did not see that coming
you can't see everything you're not
actually omniscient
yeah but nobody says they're mostly
omniscient if you're
if you if you're mostly omniscient
you're basically omniscient
except when you're not when you didn't
see that coming
stop bringing that up when you didn't
see possibly one of the most important
do you have a house on the island where
are you i don't
why don't you consider this a personal
invitation
come visit lovely grey dragon island
sounds like a plan to me how do we get
there without
running into the siricari in the uh
the flesh tank has had some repairs done
it's
the kara siri were really more of a
penum thing
tell us more about your friends who's
gonna say he has friends
you're gonna have to come to the island
to find out and apparently
you're gonna bring most of imperial
japan with you
well yeah but maybe we could show up
first if you were planning on having a
dinner party
that is if you have a house in the
volcano
and a table big enough to seat all of us
this is true
and good food and alcohol
i wouldn't eat anything from those
waters
i would need anything that he and his
minions made
emma what are you doing i don't know
just making this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up as i go along
what else do i usually do you think
and he just keeps admitting how hollow
he is
uh and then that he's only sort of
omniscient
hmm look if you don't have the capstone
i have nothing to worry about
and i happen to know you don't have the
capstone
but we know where it is and we know how
to get it
and or we know how to deal with that
problem
when's the last time you heard about
shanghai
who said i was talking about shanghai
that's where the capstone is
that one
going to the future takes a tremendous
amount
of energy which is why and i'd rather do
no i mean i can do it with the reactor
under the volcano is quite strong
reactor okay i just have to ask was it
that green thing that
that was in the boat the green thing
you know what's what's the point of you
not knowing this yes
that was a small portion of the power
and penhue
penhue was wonderful but he was
short-sighted
all he wanted to do was fire the rocket
off
into the gap and tear the rend wide open
and bring the elder gods down upon the
earth
but that would have led to the
penu was crazy i'm smart
and omniscient i am gonna use this
weapon to rule the world
only partially omniscient
look partially omniscient might as well
be omniscient to you monkeys no offense
monkey
gorilla well the problem of course
the problem is is the same problem that
you have a man
the problem that you have is the same
problem if you drive a vehicle and
there's a blind spot
and there's someone there
i don't see a problem i just hit the
have you hit a lot of cars because
you actually want me to answer that
question i mean your face looks like
snap i'm not attractive i know this i
don't care
more of this witty repartee back and
forth another wacky plan to poison me
that is doomed to failure
i mean if you think that you're a part
if you're done mansplaining stuff why
don't you just take off
you asked me what a reactor was yeah
and i didn't give look if you want the
physics of it i could go in
to an entire preamble on the physics of
that reactor it's fascinating
i'm an opera singer an assassin it all
goes about a mile over my head and
that's fine
allister puts his hand up hollister
however i'm sure would love to know all
yeah people look you'd like to share
that
information you're volunteering it
oh no i don't know we we we would love
to hear you
go wax for wax
philosophical about about all the
physical about all the physics things
that you know
no no we don't want any physical
philosophical no we want we just want
the physics
oh the physics are going to go to any
country that lets that that
swears fealty to me that'll get
interesting
so this is a weapon of some sort not
just
green glowy stuff it's an infinite power
source
and the infinite the genius of it is
the runoff of that power source the
byproduct
which most people think of as waste is a
waste that's a weapon yes
so to create my limitless power
okay i have to i create the material
that allows me to make
weapons that will bend this world to my
will
jotting this all down i mean honestly
all that weird like pledging your fealty
to some
amorphous cosmic deity bad idea
as long as you're providing breakfast i
thought you were coming for dinner
dinner
is a pantsuit appropriate sorry it's
just it's a standing joke
you want to continue that misogynistic
comment or to stop yeah i wasn't too
sure if that is a positive thing or a
negative thing i'm confused
you're trying to kill me why i'm not
gonna compliment you
that's what i thought i thought you were
so okay so i'll have a portal
in this room tomorrow night for dinner
well
really in what like eight hours well no
it's only one in the morning in in
and before i go i have one more treat
for you
time is a mutable concept you know who
taught me that
this little guy and next to him in the
hologram
and youssef is um
he looks emaciated
he he he doesn't acknowledge anything
guess whose blood is full of time magic
this little guy i'm so glad that the
he used to love dinner it was one of his
yes your little patch did what what you
really i'm just here to prove my
superiority in all ways and convince you
but you don't know what's coming next
omniscient i know some things that are
coming
well there's no hiding at dinner by the
way
i'm not going to try and kill you at
dinner
that's too easy i
i just want to show you the world that i
can offer
a world of peace a world where there
there's no conflict
a world where everyone is balanced on
the edge of a knife
a world where there are no there are no
have-nots
everyone has limitless power
caused by my reactor the peace is caused
then the piece won't last it never does
no matter how many people you talk to
that are of relatively
high intelligence there's going to be
other people who have other reasons and
other how can you deal with all of that
at once
well i am omniscient partially
but okay even if you if even if you you
know everything
how do you deal with it all at once are
you here and here and here are you
talking to 15 people at the same time 20
people
a thousand people no no
that's not how holograms work that would
be that would be cloning
huh but then how do you trust the clones
i mean that is the question there's
too easy yeah yeah no so and
how do you trust other people to do even
if you give them power how do you trust
them to do the
right thing with it and what happens
when they do the wrong thing
i mean if human history has shown
anything it's that power corrupts
then it is peace at the edge of a knife
yeah mister i'm not really here
we'll be there for dinner there'll be a
portal outside waiting for you
we'll see you then i'd like to get some
sleep go away
uh i wouldn't stay in this house then
and he'll yeah the the hologram goes
out and you notice
now on the floor is a small metal box
a very flat metal box
go over and poke it with the toe of my
shoe it's a metal box
with some sort of uh
some sort of um
gemstone or something set in it it's
about
it's about three inches on each side
apparently i'll turn it over and over do
i see any screws or anything
holding this thing together no and it
doesn't feel like
oh this is weird and what color is the
stone
uh the the stone is a weird transparent
red
okay so it's not green no yeah okay
well we're not taking this with us oh
but we should take the stone
no we want to keep it all in one piece
if we want to try to understand it
that and we're not taking it into the
house where we're sleeping i feel like
that's a
a way for him to get in yeah same with
the dead spider with his head on it
we should not bring that with us either
um yeah it's you know it is not doing
the horror movie
staple of of dissolving it's just
sitting there yeah there's just a little
dead body that every once in a while
twitches a little
do we leave it yes
are you gonna tell anybody yeah clean up
on aisle five
that's what i'm thinking we don't want
somebody to just walk in here absolutely
is there is there a courtyard is there a
courtyard in this place
yeah why don't why don't we haul this
out to the courtyard and set it on fire
then at least there's only ashes to deal
with well the japanese would like to
look at it
i'm sure they would wait was that
hollister or that
flint you got
to separate these characters they can't
be in the same area because i'm thinking
what both of them would be
doing you you have to be very calm and
collected for hollister and very
boisterous for flint yeah uh
let's just say that hollister takes the
box and brings that to the embassy and
wraps that up and gets that into safe or
something
okay all right for the spider
i need all the explosives all of them
hold on hold on to what
he said that he made how many of these
thousands
what do we think is waiting for us at
gray dragon island then
a reactor to blow up that's what he says
thousands of these and if we're gonna
send japanese troops there
they should know what they're dealing
with and even just seeing it to prepare
for
could make the difference that's some
fun training
there's there's real value in keeping
this
all right if you want to haul it back to
some training camp or some building
to shock japanese soldiers with havoc
you can have your own little freak show
there you go socks insane grenade you
throw the spider at them like you're
under attack
this was a real spider with a person's
head on it you'd all be
dead
is that what they do to you at boot camp
i mean mentally torture you it's like a
joke the sock thing is a joke no one
it's it's too cliche i've always heard
that
i've always heard that the point of boot
camp was to break you mentally so so
they can put you back together in their
image
no the the well i went to the i was in
the air force so it
was a marching camp they teach you how
oh i already got i think they changed i
think i think they uh
they're actually trying to do for some
reason actual training now but i don't
know why
not i was not in the military but i
lived on a navy base
and navy bases the training there is all
about dogma
it's basically everything they do is
teaching you to live on a boat
like all the all the training boats that
are on land
are 75 of the size of the regular boat
so that when you get on the boat you're
like
hey this is pretty nice
and i mean to be fair i've been on a
tiger cruise because my sister was in
the navy so i was on
one of those i was on uh
the the mesa verde for about three days
i wouldn't want to live there no thank
you that was tiny
no thanks and the food the food was
awful and and i was told that was good
because they brought in the good stuff
for the tigers
which was us well so the navy is has is
supposedly has the best food in the
service but the the land food is worse
than the seafood
but so when i was in so we were we were
there as part of like americorps so we
were like you know community service
hippie kids
we're gonna make the world better and
we're on a navy base but you go to the
um you go to the galley and
they do things like the vegetarian pasta
is in the same
like the vegetarian pasta sauce is
in the same bowl as the meat sauce you
know it's all cooked together and all
this stuff but
uh so you get your food and when you
realize how inedible it is
you go up to the the garbage
and they take a polaroid of you
immediately and they have this huge
wall if you if you're throwing away any
food
they have this huge wall of polaroids
that says don't let your eyes get larger
than your stomach
because food waste at sea is a huge
problem
and so they're like conditioning you to
not throw away food to like take every
either eat everything you get or do it
was
it was all very weird like packaged
from our from our dining facilities we
would like
i'd go straight over get like the yogurt
is packaged in something no one has
touched this and ruined it
like that's that was the only thing i
would get from there
it was hamburger and fries were pretty
safe
but that was like a special line and
that line everybody went to that line
it was awesome boxes of cereal and
cartons of milk those were pretty safe
yeah the salad bar was the thing of
really nightmares i'd never seen canned
salad before it was
it's terrifying we are far afield
are we ready to take a break uh
so we do have a giveaway coming up if
you haven't gotten it in there
it's hashtag chaos and
we're going to be giving away your
choice of i saw this on screen i'm going
to see if i get this right
a gale force 9 deck or the call of
cthulhu coloring book
if you're in the u.s if you're in europe
you're getting a pdf of the coloring
book
there it is look at that i even got it
right
uh it's like i can read so are you
guys gonna do
anything the day of the 25th
um flint you know that you are getting
all sorts of pressure from imperial
command
about like when are we going they
they are very happy that you brought
them that spider and the same people
that are
tearing apart the portal are now
starting to tear apart that spider
i thought that was the 26th because it
yeah the 20 no this is the 25th it was
the night of the 21st
the the night of the 25th the morning of
the 26th yeah yeah you're right right at
1 am
yeah 20 okay so i want explosives
because i'm going to blow up all the
weapons
are we talking to taro do i get to talk
to taro and tell him that i got invited
to a dinner party
a megalomaniac who claims he has
all of all of the worst weapons in the
world i mean flint you could easily make
a meeting with taro happen
yeah yeah i'll do that much i'm sorry
i'm thinking about what hollis
hollister is actually reflecting a lot
so i'm i'm in hollister's head right now
and not flints
um and you sent that message to rogers
right yeah
all right so joan will
spend some time teaching oh great yeah
they are
they are very they're they're they're
their knowledge is clearly rudimentary
but like they are
trying to you know like there's a
hundred you you give a lecture to like a
hundred people
that are all like seriously taking notes
about
you know the the the ritual of creating
an elder sign
and they are going to like start
practicing
immediately all right jonah's in her
element
i am i am actually they ask if you would
um if you would like oversee some of
their
but you mean sit in on your training no
oh they want you to like lead some of
their training
well this is this is this is what i have
i do know a few other things but this is
the main thing this is the this is the
thing that that that it's very useful
all over the place and i i want to
concentrate on this and make sure every
people know about this so i will be
concentrating professor lam you are
pulled aside by their lead
researcher yes and he says perhaps we
can come to an
some occult materials that i think would
be of a great deal of interest
to you perhaps we could work out an
information sharing we we greatly
appreciate
your teaching us the showing us this
ritual
yes and we know that this is merely the
the only thing i'm worried about is if i
am not here
after imparting knowledge i can't help
nurture it i can't help
and i'm not going to be able to stay
here very long
you will plant seeds the roots of which
will grow
for generations to come
we could talk about that if you've
heard about the
the the the capstone and the ritual
for that
we might be able to talk about that
yes but you could glean other knowledge
of other things from it i i'm
i'm just saying i can't i'm not going to
be here for very long and i won't be
able to help
very much i would love to but i i'm not
we have
i'm sharing with you now secrets that
are known to very few
we have theoretical texts that speak
of dimensions where time operates
that's very interesting
do you have you heard anything of these
do you know any sort of
temporal rituals or or learnings
i've heard about these things from other
people
you have notes
some of them are not here um
you know i've been i've been traveling a
lot let me go back and see what i have
and we should talk to some more again
and he'll he'll go off
um so that was he was the lead
trainer of the um
the ministry of uh
gosh what would they call it i don't
know cult
the ministry of the the imperial
i'm
and i think this is a good spot to take
a break as joan will cut joan will spend
her
day sort of teaching the elder sign
ritual
to a hundred avid pupils emma
is gonna talk with taro about explosives
we'll deal with that after the break and
we'll find out what the other two are
doing then
uh so hashtag chaos at the break don't
forget to get in there for that giveaway
and we will be back just as soon as
here uh
welcome back internet friends so
excited to say that our good friend
squeal the bard has won
uh the giveaway the winner is a wooden
dice box
look at that look what he means
congratulations
um we will we will send that to you
as you have your choice
of a pdf of the call of cthulhu coloring
book
or a gale force nine deck whichever
suits your fancy i moved the wrong way
right and left i'm like
yeah i'm like there we go i'm trying to
center myself
i need a mar i you know in the studio
there's actually a mark
and i know where i am at home there's
not a mark
yeah so congratulations on the table
well the problem is the camera's in a
different spot every time because
um they shock you to learn that uh
my i don't normally have my computer set
up to video
chat with the people on the internet
normally it's
why does it actually work or play video
games i would
say isn't that work i mean that's all i
do all day is video chat
i mean to be fair i have my computer set
up so that i have to like raise my arms
up at a weird angle to hit the keyboard
and that just does not work so
usually i'm not at this angle uh
so at the br we we broke
uh with professor lam returning from
imperial mythos ministry emma
flint has set up a meeting with uh
um
like the usual crazy like look look what
i did this is going to be amazing
i got i got a dinner party scheduled
with taro first of all
you're on mute thomas i'm not
no no we're good
i'm no i'm not i'm not muted nobody's
muted
what huh what
are you taro is very he's
you are going to gray dragon island
yeah why not oh and i'm not like
wait what why not why
okay the word hostages that's up for
debate but listen
i need all the explosives that you have
that i can carry on my person because i
gotta get the explosives through a
portal
you also probably need to send a boat to
come pick me up in case i can't portal
back out of there
um why do you wish to blow up this
island
well a that's what i do
b because he says that he has a
weapon
weapons of immense power and
he thinks that that's what's going to
rule the world
and he's going to use it to threaten
everybody and try and run the world
so if i just blow the whole island up
there's also dinner did i mention dinner
tell me more about these weapons i don't
know
i mean he just said weapon and then
something about like
the power to actually i wasn't really
listening
so there's something about the power
waste being also powerful
i don't know
so you come to me a representative of a
nation state
who you were me i am representative of
imperial japan
oh okay got it yeah and you suggest
that i give you the means to destroy
a weapon of great power
if this portal that you suggest is
coming
why do we not send armed men
through the portal and take this weapon
i think he'll like here's the thing is
that stanford thinks that he knows
everything he thinks that he's
omniscient so he thinks that
like that's what you're gonna do so what
you have to do
is just do the opposite
you are suggesting you should just come
with us it'll be fun
just put on a tux it'll be a good time
take whatever you want to take just in
case you feel like having a thing like
bring a deck of cards maybe maybe we'll
play some games after
i don't know i am afraid
that we cannot give you explosives to
destroy
this weapon why what are you afraid of
we are afraid that we will lose
this weapon but here's the thing you may
never actually get the weapon to begin
with
so there's that it's far more likely we
won't get it
if you blow it up but at least do not
blow it up
we still have the opportunity to get
this weapon
but here's the thing if i blow it so
here's the thing if i mess everything up
that's the best scenario possible
because
if i don't then you try and get the
weapon and you don't
then stanford still has the weapon see
you will forgive me if i have more faith
in the military of imperial japan than i
do
maybe i should just call her then maybe
she'll be interested in going to dinner
with me
all right yeah you you storm out and
so are there any grenades anywhere that
i've seen at
all possible for me to take it may shock
you to learn that the grenade stores
have all been shut down by the uh
oppressive regime of imperial japan
i'm just saying not at the embassy
i mean you could go ask at the american
embassy
that would go over well tell another
country that there's a weapon of
incalculable power
yeah actually maybe do they can fight
over it yes
that would be awesome they already are
not yet
yes they are just not out in the open
yeah
um and uh
uh hollister uh
you at the when you go back to the
embassy
uh in the afternoon as soon as you
come in
a guy comes up to you and he says oh
thank god i've been holding this mirror
all morning
uh i have a cable that says i'm supposed
can i take this mirror with me anywhere
i i don't know i was supposed to give it
to you
okay nothing else
that's all i have sorry check i'm here
but i got a we got a diplomatic cable
saying that i had to give you this
mirror
okay thank you and that you should look
at it
i'm gonna go do that right now okay okay
i mean he will walk off confused
um
and you look in the mirror uh
and somewhere privately yeah yeah you
you have a you still have a room at the
embassy
so you look in the mirror
and there is a very
bored person in a uniform
reading aloud a book
oh i'll knock on the mirror hello oh
thank god
oh if i if i stop talking apparently the
spell stops working
uh let me oh somebody get rogers
please
oh and a cup of tea
uh mr captain rogers will be with
you
uh shortly he
oh god it's been four hours i'm so sick
of rebecca of sunnybrook farm
they don't have you trade out with
someone
no two hours no
i'm not out i was just told to sit here
and read this
um i if i i'm afraid if i stop
talking that it'll turn off
um how are you sir i've been better
but apparently free dinner tonight so
oh lovely my free
the government gives me free dinner but
um tell them to hurry please
i don't know how to make small talk with
this person how how are you
sir did i ask that already you could
go to the
weather it's been a lovely day out
where are you tokyo
oh man i'd love to go to tokyo uh
now it's probably not a good time no
no no is the world to end
sir oh not for several months
not what i'm kidding i'm
kidding
talking keep talking thank god sir
here you talk to him and
uh the mirror like spins around and you
kind of get a little vertigo
um and there's rogers god damn
well a lot's been going on all right
where are we
where are we what sitrep
i got your last report yeah yeah
get work out transportation for the
plans
put them in a give give them the same
treatment you gave
uh i am not putting that in a block
of concrete
no no no put them in a put them in a
secure case
okay and they will get to mirror the
rest
yeah the the embassy can handle that uh
and since it's a diplomatic pouch they
the japanese won't be able to search it
okay
um do we want just in case something
happens along the way
uh do you want people to try and make
copies of these beforehand so we have
something no they don't need to be eyes
only
the fewer copies of these of this thing
there is around the better it is for
everybody
now am i to understand that you think
there might be
one of these weapons actually
functioning
yes
is there any chance we could get our
hands on it i wouldn't recommend it we
you've got the plans that's this is
unrealistic and and if
we could just blow up the whole island i
think that'd be for the best to be
honest
it's going to take us a while to get any
sort of naval presence there to actually
blow it up
well looks like tonight i'll be
having dinner there so i'll see what i
can do
spider portals he offered to
i still can't believe he gave though he
gave that away
it's a fair point wish we could learn to
yep we've got um
i have good news i'm not sure
how long it's going to take for us to
get them to you but we have
fairly successfully
um fantastic one of the reasons it's
going to take us so long
to get naval presence to you
is that we are we're essentially
okay
that'll be great against the sea people
it is a new color of paint that the
military
we were unprepared for but we're
gonna have uh
the entire ship will hopefully be
protected
but it's
when when would be your best case
i mean things are moving so quickly i i
have no idea what's gonna happen tonight
um i know japan wants to move quickly
so if you can get these plans and get
there as soon as possible to take out
yeah it's up to your best judgment
though
so we can out of pearl harbor
i'm just going gonna look up world war
battleships
boy the u.s navy in world war one was
typically name them after states right
they named them after presidents didn't
like the indiana and things like that
hey the texas was around so the uss
texas uh
the uss texas will be
uh we could it can get there if we if we
we can be done by the end of in two days
with the the retrofitting we can be out
of pearl harbor
at full steam we should be there
oh i think i think that might
do it hopefully things go well tonight
and you're just there to do cleanup
all right uh
uh
i flint took a
spider with stanford's head into them
to look at
frozen no no no i'm just okay okay
uh rogers is implacable
i've i've i've been a bit
preoccupied since our meeting with
stanford as too
how we're gonna handle that my apologies
we don't want the japanese
yeah we've we've spoken about that
and we're
we're trying to keep the information as
under wraps as possible
did you already mention to rogers that
the japanese got a portal spider
something about portals because it can
cause because he said that the portals
were super
useful he would
have if i had if not he would say it now
um i don't remember though but he would
have brought that up the same as he
brought up the
well no i don't know was he aware of
that
oh yeah you're right you weren't there
yeah you're right you weren't there
yeah i might not know about it all right
okay
um great all right uh
we need to very strictly control
the amount of information we give the
japanese
and they can under no circumstances gain
access to that weapon
no i understand that's why i think
i think sabotage or destroying it is our
we can ask i don't i don't believe
the embassy has any explosives
on site we wouldn't be able to bring
them with us anyways
if we did stanford would have
foresight
whatever we do we have to do there if
i no i don't think we can i mean i i
think it's just
i i have an idea but all right well
yeah the more i submit the more we
cement ourselves to anything
i think the less chance there is of
success
all right well let's plan on
you report back to me at 11 15
tomorrow morning your time okay
just look in the mirror
and don't make donaldson have to read
for three hours again
i didn't do that to him and you could
have done that in shifts
i could stand about one chapter of that
damn book before i had to get out of
here
insipid
all right now how do you hang up i hang
up the mirror
uh yeah he as usual he just goes
aldridge
i assume i i went back with you but
didn't go into this room with you
hollister
no you're you're going to be spending
most of the day training
the japanese all right want to make sure
where we were at okay yeah you're
you're you're working with them uh
alexander are you doing anything today
mostly just working with the new daggers
that i have because these are
entirely new to me and doing something
purely physical will take my mind off of
sure everything yeah sure so that's
that's most of my day
all right any last preparations
before you guys all get together before
uh dinner
um
anything else you want to do before geez
refresh my medical supplies
um the embassy does have medical
supplies so they'll
yeah i i would like to to talk to dr
hollister tell him a little bit about my
experience with the the japanese
okay oh yes okay so uh
we go we go i'm gonna get some therapy
um but what i really wanna do is is tell
him that
um i wanna let you know i got pulled
aside
by the uh
the trainer the lead trainer in charge
of what they're calling
the imperial mythos
uh ministry they
are very very
interested in learning about time
manipulation
they asked me about my books
and my notes which we have in the in the
safe in the embassy and i told them i
would have to try to
get a hold of things so i i could get
out of there but they're
really interested in it i mean i did i
did i had a great time teaching them
about
the elder sign but they want more
they do want to trade with us though
they say they have a lot more
about time manipulation
i'm sure they'd say that do we have
anything else i
i tried to tell them i said hey you know
i'll trade you this uh
the ritual the for the capstone and they
said yeah no that's that's that's too
specific they want more generic they
want and and i'm afraid
i'm afraid that they're looking for
weapons that they want power
i'm afraid they want me to stay longer
they're they're really saying hey can
you teach us more can you teach us more
and i keep telling them i'm not going to
be here very long i'm not going to be
here very long
so i may need some protection well
i mean after this you might want to stay
in the embassy staying staying on their
compounds
yeah it'd be an extremely bad idea and i
know i know it's bad and i told them
that i said you know i'm not going to be
here very long and if i give you things
i can't stay and teach you more i can't
stand see how it evolves i can't stay
and protect them from themselves work
with them is what i said i didn't
quite get them to protect themselves but
that's a good one i think i will
but they they're really adamant
about it so i'm i just want to make sure
you knew if there was anything else
we thought we
might be able to feed them to get them
stuff in uh
we'd want to basically give them garbage
to throw them
off of you give you some room to breathe
if we had something do you do you guys
have something that we could give to
them
that we could trade with them that's
that's old lore
you could probably forget just a couple
of things about
silvano's notes that would be like
you know yeah so i'm gonna work with dr
hollister and look at those a little bit
to see if we can figure out something
uh both of you make me cthulu meet those
roles
how would i i got a zero
nine my catholic mythos is at 13.
if i mean i have probably not okay i
mean
nope all right so yeah professor
lam
you notice a very small part
as you're going through the notes you
think you found plenty stuff that's kind
of
semi-innocuous it's more on the occult
end and you actually catch
a few things that could be potentially
dangerous
that you you know you you excise out so
yeah you have a good
um oh no
what what what someone just joined is
like hey this is my first time what's
the long story they're a bastard i'm so
sorry
uh they're going to an island to try and
um so yeah you exise out a couple of
things that could have potentially been
potentially i make a copy yeah
and phew i throw my pen around and
i make a copy
of of of somebody oh well all right
so they're heading they're heading to
they're about to go have dinner on gray
dragon island
uh with carl stanford who killed sir
aubry penhue
and took everything over so
welcome this is this is massive
narrative otep but i have uh
they have caused all sorts of
irreparable damage to the campaign and i
have matched them
wound for wound so it's only vaguely
recognizable at this point
to be fair part of it was your fault
i take i take full responsibility but
yeah so you
you find some stuff you probably
won't have the chance to give it to them
before you leave for dinner unless you
want to just like send it over
no no no i will tomorrow we will do the
thing
that was going to be my whole thing is i
need to go get my notes i needed to get
some things
and then i would i would see them
tomorrow okay all right
um so i guess you're gonna go to that
first house again and wait
and wait for your portal to show up
emma's apparently dressing for dinner
of course i am so at 7 30
um you guys all head to that house
and taro is there in full military
uniform
and he when when emma walks in he says
ah
i thought you were angry i thought you
knowledge is never wasted
all right buddy you're taking your life
into your own hands let's go
i mean it won't be the first time there
is yeah there's a
good chance we're not coming back from
this
i'm a military man that's true of every
mission i undertake
so at eight o'clock a spider
comes skittering in tarou has not seen
he's surprisingly okay with all of this
um
and the spider turns into a portal and
through the portal you see a sandy
beach
with a path that leads up into a
mountain
here we go and we just walk through
yep just i will stride through first
i i unconsciously check my daggers or
knives
and just here we go they're much harder
to conceal
yeah i'm wearing much looser clothing
than i usually do
although the japanese style for men
would allow for that anyway
right and so yeah taro
strides through and he's standing on the
beach
and you can all see him as he's kind of
gone through and he's
in for a penny in for a pound i'm this
i'm with y'all
my my first instinct though is looking
through at the at the beach i want to
see if there's any cars siri
anywhere within sight everything looks
empty
and taro is not like freaking out or
panicking or anything like that okay
all right then i'll step through uh
right after him
all right yeah so once you're on the
beach
one way in and here we go
when we walk through where like because
we've been to the island before where
are
we so you are on the other side from
where the flesh tank was
okay okay you're on the beach that
um that you fled to when you circled the
island
and there's a path that leads up and all
of the sudden
like tiki torches just start lighting up
sweet oh that's i like that yeah yeah
i'm like
a nice trick i'm glad you two enjoy it
yeah uh
and taro says we should not be late to
dinner
if he offers his arm to emma i'm walking
the other direction i'm like
no you two first and i'll be in the
middle oh well
taro will lead the way all right not too
happy
um and again he's like he's not dressed
for fighting he's in his dress uniform
sure you know this is his his his nicest
uniform
do we have matching swords yes
that's wonderful and so yeah you
you head up and everybody make me a
spot hidden roll
oh my god this is the first time we've
rolled all day i'm like where's my dice
oh yes hard all right um
everybody that makes it feels very
watched critical are there critical
what now is there any more of that metal
like under the sand or something i'm
wondering if he had buried
you haven't seen that with a heart
and a critical success you two
you'll see anybody who got a harder
critical success
will see some sort of
um larger than a person there are larger
than a person figures
in the overgrowth that are watching you
okay and
i'll say and of course we're being
watched
i mean we're walking on to his
territory he has the home game advantage
to borrow borrow gets a critical success
as well
to borrow an american term they he he
has the the home
right before you get to the volcano taro
will
just turn his head back and say i wish
to
just make sure one more time none of you
have any explosives
seriously no and he's like he like looks
pointedly at emma
i mean fair very well
um you come up to the lip and there's
like a cave
entrance and standing at this cave
entrance
who would remember this uh
joan you would remember it
you might be the only one that has run
into a fish man before
no alexandria has weren't they on the b
team's boat or was it
i thought it was the beetroot no no no
no
that was i i mean i saw them i saw
savannah chewing on them as i was coming
out of the oh right
silvano ate one i forgot about that yes
no no that
that was the a-team's boat not the beach
all right so joan
alexandra and i don't remember i'm sure
emma saw them too
uh one of those
a huge you know eight feet tall
um kind of a bipedal shark
wearing a butler's outfit and it has
in one hand it has a
there's a silver tray with a little note
taro has not seen one of these before
and hollister i don't think you have
either
taro is not okay with this i'm okay with
it
all right taro loses some sanity oh man
that would be awesome if he went insane
um we should never have come here
it was your truth you came here um
so you know taro doesn't want
to get near this thing
so but it's just standing there with
the platter with the note on it i
will go
and and and and get the the name right
i'm staring at the thing like yeah i
know you
uh the smell of this thing is is what
like
triggers your reminders just this
overpowering
fishy stench all right they taste way
yeah so no i got the i've got the i've
got the paper does he do anything
uh it says the paper says
crumple crumple crumple put it in my
pocket what did it say
it said i knew you'd bring a plus one
he's taunting us
whatever no anything anything before the
portal
he probably he checked
i mean i that depends he said it takes a
great deal of energy to
go forward and he says he has plenty of
energy
by the time we walked over here he could
have written that come on let's let's
just go in
what is this energy that he has
something that made me violently ill the
and what was it don't know
something green and glowing it's all i
know about it
he was talking about something called a
reactor
and it's a source of great power so he
doesn't just have a weapon
why don't we go on and find out what we
find out
um the the
the fish man once you take the note
we'll say
her mother's free warfare now
and he he he
turns around and he shambles off into uh
this and you are now inside the
caldera of a volcano
and you're walking down this long
winding thing and you can see
in the volcano is a huge uh
there are these fish men everywhere and
inside the volcano down at the base
it looks like a it looks like a bullet
but it's huge there's a huge bullet
pointed straight up
out of the volcano and these fish men
are like climbing all over it and uh
working on it and doing and and you know
seeming to work with it you recognize
hollister from the plans that this is
although alexandria would probably
notice that before me
yeah possibly
it looks you know what are they using
the lava to push this thing out i mean
what
what can this i still don't get why i
maybe something about the portal would
it would mess up the energy
hopefully so
about a quarter of the way down
the butler takes you into a side passage
uh and you
walk for a ways through these caves and
uh
and he stops at the door
uh an open door and he uh
and inside there is a a large
dining room with places set for all six
of you
all five of you sorry yeah five
and sitting there is carl stanford
evening hello
thank you so much for taking the
invitation please
please be seated and commander
taro wasn't it have you
come to have you come to perhaps
i'm just like what it's like we're all
like looking at yeah
i am unaware of an offer
japan is always looking for interested
partners
i'm sitting as far away from those guys
as possible
yeah taro will sit like right next to uh
stanford
yeah what else is in this room
like can i get a little bit more
description so this is a
rough hewn cavern with a beautiful
um the wood
looks like driftwood it looks like you
know the
water has like sanded it down
um but it is a a beautiful
long table with plenty of room to seat
all of you
um at each place there is a salad
already set and there is like
fine there is fine cutlery there
uh the the napkins
uh all seem to be from different cruise
ships
from the future no future napkins
do we recognize any of the cruise ships
yes i was gonna say
no no ah
and yeah there's it's it's a it's a
it's a
the the place setting and stuff is like
faux luxury
as a juxtaposed with the rough hewn uh
uh sort of way that everything is set up
here
i was gonna ask about what area seaweed
and are there more rooms attached to
this one or is it just like
it's just yeah there seems to be a
kitchen or something
off to the side there's there's one
opening at the back of the left side of
the room
where the butler went that way when he
when he left
and then there's the open the open
door into the passageway
so what would you like to know
that deserves a tiana just tell his
brain just broke without with a mental
crossover
ow
so have you seen it to your own future
well seeing your own future is very hard
because you went into the future
correct i did i did and you saw
played out well interestingly
so it must have ended in a worthwhile
scenario
interestingly
there is theoretically a way
that one can see oneself
in the future in a um
well for lack of a better word in a more
constant way
i unfortunately when you look in the
future for yourself
there's there's a fair amount of
i
the future that i have seen has shown me
that this weapon doesn't get launched
and that tells me
that the nations of the world know
enough
well that's certainly one option yes
oh i know what you're thinking haha the
thing didn't get
launched because we stopped him i didn't
see it blow up
sure i've studied you
very carefully once i learned who my
my adversaries might be wow
i'm famous well
um your your friend who
unfortunately couldn't join us for
dinner
your friend told me
how much you uh
he told me how much i should be worried
about you and how dangerous
so many of you are
well he didn't know you oh you mean
joseph
yes there were several friends that you
i have i have spoken to two of your
friends
one of them is uh
your friend youssef is unfortunately
taken a more utilitarian route but
your friend silvano
has become something of an intergalactic
tourist
i'm sure he hates that
well i don't have to hear him screaming
anymore
he's yoga's problem now i think you were
talking about our futures
well i'll just say this
i see the one with the knives
being pulled below the water
and drowning almost like
a memory of hers that i've heard her
tell
i've seen uh
the the the nun
and professor lam professor lam
and japan oh taro japan's future
understanding the geopolitical situation
agrees to be one of the first nations
and with the combination of
my technology and weaponry
and the might of imperial japan
the future my friends is bright
so what's for dinner oh yes
and at this point three more of the
the fish men come out with trays
and it looks like there are
semi-live octopus on little beds of rice
ah is it moving
uh it's fresh
just killed
out of curiosity mr stanford
when did you see these futures
oh was it before or after when your
third
so it was before donald left
uh before i that's why i killed pinhue
because i knew that was my moment to get
so that future was bleak things are
i suppose it's all a matter of
perspective
hey if i get more if i get more
information and get more
oh you get limitless power
we'll see there you go if i have a
limited split
limitless power little limitless power
i guess we'll just have to find out but
your your trick
of using people as a battery comes in
very very handy
is there any chance that we can see
uh would you bring bring the
wheelchair up would you
of course our majesty one of the fishmen
will
go off if he's not too busy
he's he's very useful in accelerating
our timetables for work
some of the materials that we create
here have very limited
existences and his being able to extend
their time on this
plane is very useful
yeah yeah i can see that
what would have a short time on this
plane uh
reach over just like put a hand on
joan's shoulder focus is no one else
going to eat their appetizers they're
quite good taro like takes some
chopsticks and he will
wolf down the octopus i'll watch tara to
timing like okay it's been three minutes
maybe it's good i'll eat the rice yeah
the rices
yeah i mean it tastes fine
once the tentacle stops wriggling i'll
eat it yeah all right
uh you needn't worry
unlike some people i don't use poison
i'm not gonna kill you while you're here
the whole point of bringing you here
is to show you the impossible odds
that you face and to
let you realize that you should take my
offer
so enjoy this dinner you should know
franz
my chef before his transition
chef
what do you what do you mean between
employers or between life forms
yes well more the more the latter um
an undersea world
that lives off of
off of the scraps from the
the surface but
i have learned how to
penhue he wanted to create those
vampire things that only existed by
killing other people that's
never create a product that fee that
that you have to kill your market
to sell i have figured out a way
do you know how many people drown in a
year
thousands and all of those people that
drown
can potentially be these and he points
at
do they get hauled into the depths of
the sea
i mean they're drowning and as they
come down if
my friends here deign to save them
they give them the gift of being able to
breathe in the water
they they make them a
if it's more perfect how come you're not
there yet
my future does not involve me
becoming a deep one my future involves
me
i've already had a crown made really
what does it look like surprised you're
not wearing it
bad luck you never wear the crown before
ah the next course is here and now they
bring out
some actual baked fish
um and it again super fresh um
it's tuna and it is very well made
it's from a pastry chef i'm surprised
something
unfortunately since the change franz is
a little fixated on seafood but luckily
it's all delicious
i asked what form he took no like
glance over at the at the shark person
and if you end a couple of the others
who are around oh yeah he's a deep one
does he look like a shark or something
else
i guess they kind of look like sharks
i mean it's interesting their necks are
you know their their necks are faced
forward
i'm just deeply intrigued by all of this
what other questions do you have
commander taro
the weapon i'd like a tour please
of course well we'll we'll we'll take
a tour and then we'll have dessert
excellent
and i hope you like fishro
will we be able to see joseph by any
chance
well as i said he may be busy but
perhaps we'll see him
uh along the way and so he'll lea
he'll lead you back out and you start to
walk down
that like spiraling path down the
volcano
and there are okay
i'm gonna be last because i never ever
um as you come down you see that not
only are there
um deep ones working on on this weapon
but they're also those spiders like
crawling all
over it uh
and and who was it
uh professor lam you asked how i can be
in so many places and once
yes well well
you know what show don't tell and he
pulls out a little whistle
and he blows this whistle that is silent
and
um you see as one
all the spiders in this cavern like turn
and look
and when they all turn and look they all
i have a good head on a lot of shoulders
we're talking hundreds we talk in there
are probably hundreds that you can see
here
you were talking about clones earlier
are they
what are they i'm intrigued that you
know what clones are
the word the word makes sense copy of a
copy
yes that's true so those are clones
so then how do you trust them you said
for menial tasks fair enough
but they have your head on them do they
know everything you know then
no it's
it's very hard i've tried grafting heads
onto other things it's not my specialty
uh the people who are your friend is
visiting in yoga they're quite good at
it
i'm hoping he can bring back some
interesting
you see and hear what they do and if so
i don't see and hear what they do uh
that would be overwhelming i'm sure well
probably not for me but for you it would
be overwhelming
i can hear them you know they all they
and my my fish friends have uh
very effective communications uh
as as near as i can tell they're
they're semi they're at least
semi-telepathic
i mean obviously voices don't carry
underwater so they'd have to have some
other form of communication
uh and so by this point you reach the
floor
um it is it is it is very definitely
warm down here
uh the um
the rocket is about 15
and he'll walk right up and he'll just
lay a hand on one of the fins and he'll
say
we have three others
down below they need to be assembled
this one is in launch position this is
our this is our ready threat
we have to uh
i'll use your term we have to put the
capstone on it and
you notice that the the top of it is
flat
and there's definitely an area where
something would be attached
there and hollister you remember from
the
uh from the blueprint that
most of this thing is propulsion and
then at the top there's a small bit that
is
whatever the weapon part is that you
but within and out we could have this
launched within an hour
and thanks to
the power that we use to both
propel it and to arm it
we're pretty sure it could reach
without a porter no portals involved
putting putting fissile material
through portals
is a very bad idea
have you have you tried it i was like
what does that mean
yeah taro is like what i don't know
fissile
yeah it would blow up early
yes essentially uh
much of the much of the power of this
weapon
is in the instability of its molecular
stance
and putting it through a portal
highlights that instability and seems to
so it's an unstable
item but it can go really far
but putting it through more instability
would blow it up early
okay but it can go far i mean you're
saying all across the earth that's
well your intellect has not been
undersold
it being so large how how precisely are
you able to aim something like this
yeah thank you for saying something to
him before i smacked him
yes i was expecting that the joy of this
weapon
is that we only have to be
within about 20 miles of our target and
so you can get this thing within 20
miles from across the world
we're quite good at what we do all of
this is still semi-theoretical yeah i
was gonna say there's nothing that does
this right now
there's there's what do you have
possibly have to go on
research-wise have you done any tests of
it yet
it's very difficult to test something
like this
uh we do have plans to make an example
of one of the nations that doesn't agree
to my offer
you said you were going to use this to
close the rift
but you said you were going to close the
rift was it with one of these
no no closing the rift will be some
rather pedantic sorcery
that frankly doesn't interest me
the high priest of the deep ones will be
so but you could probably make more
money
if you just like took the weapon off of
it
and made a bunch of them so that people
could just travel
to wherever they wanted to really
quickly
money is not what interests me goes
everywhere
i mean why wouldn't you want to like be
in charge of that
like the best like invention ever i have
plenty of money
i mean this this was not inexpensive
i was bankrolling most of penu's crazy
ideas
all to get him to build this for me
because i had seen
am i really impressed so he was the
and he was not the brains behind
anything he was
give a boy i was like did that take him
all over the world because that was an
awesome thing to do
doesn't even know it oh no
that was tortured he was he's trying to
even even though i know
how great all of this is i'm still every
day
do you have any idea of where the power
like i'm assuming he said below right
that's the more interesting thing
you're going to provide unlimited power
for the world correct
the parts of the world that acquiesce
well then you would consider those parts
of the world that matter
true
so that's the important thing
um well as your friend pointed out
going too near to it is really not good
for your health
billy don't do it it hurts it was very
unpleasant
well where is it then what's below us
how do you manage it if you can't go
near it
well the good news is these babies and
he
he like he knocks on the back of one of
the spiders
and it's like a weird hard noise
these little boys don't have any problem
and i i i believe
some of you were involved with blowing
up penhue's ridiculous boat
all he wanted was he asked me if i could
make it go faster
i mean honestly i give him
a source of limitless power and he asks
if his boat can go
faster to be fair the boat blew up
without our involvement we were just
there
i believe it just blew up we were there
has been a a running through a running
through line of all of your
misadventures
yes true but this time we didn't poke
anything that we weren't supposed to we
just stepped
and then things blew up it was a trap it
was set for us we weren't involved in
the actual blowing up
well in any event penhues
uh henchmen were these
were were some of the or some of the
earliest uh
and they also are untroubled by the
power source
taro is like trying to take pictures
with his eyes and try to memorize
everything this is
fascinating honestly
entirely beyond my pay grade but
interesting nonetheless it's
i'm very pleased with myself should we
have dessert
dessert sounds wonderful he makes a fish
row custard
a little salty still not eaten any of it
i first need to tell him about plants
and about how i think
because you know you make a plan you're
hopeful
like i take them through the stages of
grief of emma's plans like there's a
whole
cycle of you make a plan that should be
the episode title the stages of grief of
emma's
plans i like it usually it starts with
half baked plan
everything blows up with we have to find
a new hotel
pretty much pretty much no we have to
find a new continent
to go to go back to that city
well we haven't burnt we haven't uh
taro looks very uncomfortable at this
point
i thought about it i'm just distracting
him with that
yes if i can indicate to the other two
like we need a moment alone
we're not with one of the spider things
around though
i'll wait for an opportunity to try and
yeah i have i have eyes on hollister
because i feel like the
the three of us or the four of us have
reasonably good synergy with what we
want to do
yeah all right yeah um
he is easily distracted by emma's like
he's like let me tell you exactly why my
plan is foolproof and i use the word
fool quite consciously here
and then i just pepper him with but what
if this happens
what if it blows up what if it blows up
i mean what if i put my finger on it and
then i accidentally do that i mean what
happens if you trip i mean
yeah and he will like he will like he's
almost like
uh paternalistically like well here's
why that wouldn't work
yeah and when we get a chance yeah you
three kind of lag behind that yeah
yeah what do we do how
how desperate are we to end this now
it's it's i mean come on his his thing
looks
pretty bad from what he said and it's
very he doesn't lie
he's maybe exaggerates but he doesn't
lie i think it's very close to being
done and the closer it gets to being
done the closer
it gets to someone being blown up yeah
some country being blown up so
desperate maybe not expeditious
i mean if you if you have an idea it's
probably better than what i would offer
i mean my idea is stick him in the back
as far as i know only alexandra has a a
and emma are the only ones that have
weapons oh i would have brought my
sword i would not bring my gun with me
okay yeah
did he say not to bring guns was this a
i imagine that his confidence is so
overweening that that there's no way
that he would be like oh yeah no
you you can't bring weapons i feel
threatened by those right no yeah
right right he can't say that he can't
these these
guys tend to have magical means of
protection
so if there's anything
confident jon is there any way that you
god i don't have any all of my notes and
stuff here it's like
if you had to improvise
i could do the ritual backwards
the transference for for sign
yeah that would be the younger sign
rather than the elder sign that was a
maybe you could try your sucking energy
thing
from him let us all be a little further
i i may not make this one i may not come
out of this one if you do that for
everybody
no i would do it from him not from you
all oh sure that always works
yeah i mean well no joan you you could
pull him a little bit ahead
you're you're a scientist yeah pull
ahead talk to him
it might work so joan you know that
you've never been able to like
pinpoint who you're taking energy from
right but if the rest of us are like 40
40 to 50 feet back we might be out of
the blast radius
but there is also the right of
transference where you go from one to
one
who knows what the right of transference
would do in this case
i'm gonna try it we can't i mean what's
he he could throw me in the pit but then
so what are you transferring
bile
pile i are going to throw up
basically basically
um how long just
really quick how long does my thing i i
would assume it would take a bit of time
to
prepare yes
so that's this happens then that's off
okay
i don't think i have a problem with that
being off the table
he's keeping secrets from us again
i can do something
you could turn one of us into a monster
don't don't dangle stuff like that in
i'm gonna i'm gonna go up with emma and
them and see if i can
so the regular transference is not a
like you don't see me doing this yeah
i know it i mean to put it in terms some
might understand
vsm but
maybe maybe you could find somewhere
private to start doing it
yeah they'll there's a there's there's a
restroom off of the
uh when you get back to the dining room
yeah
yeah and i'll like when
when it when it goes off let me know
and he like he like will interrupt emma
and he'll be like you know
interestingly this is one of only three
restrooms in the entire
uh in the entire complex i'm really the
ew what about joseph
i don't think he needs it anymore he has
a bucket
well it could it distract him he was the
other one that got pushed through
and he was
mainly in helping me understand
uh the portals
and helping me create my little
portal friends but
um the cost of them is quite high
my little portal
so where do you keep yousef and
silvano
well silvano's body
is down below
his brain as i've told you is in outer
space
uh yusef really doesn't require
sleep and pretty much exists
to use his temporal magic
but do you put him in a special room
no he just hangs out in the dining room
he's
he's where we need him when we need uh
when we need for certain unstable
elements to
last longer than they will he's down
when we need repairs or
some sort of technical work on the
rocket to
take shorter he's there
yes yes i call it a rocket
are you sure i can't convince you to
like put a couple seats in it and then
the it would kill whoever is in it
well don't put the weapon part of it in
there just
whatever your little capstone thing is
let's just you know
it it doesn't land
it's not an airplane
well why can't you just make one of
those except with a rocket
rocket plane yeah that'd be cool
i have seen the future in the future
but those are fast and they uh
unfortunately
may i and then i just take it and start
looking at hillary
so i i'm in there doing the thing so do
you need me to roll anything or
uh i'm gonna take a while
sorry a little little upset there so
you are trying to you're just gonna like
send your stomach acid to him
with the right of transference so i can
get focus on him yeah
and and just a little bit so he gets a
little confusing
squeezy and then when i come out i will
drain him more and then he won't
transferring all that that baked salmon
into his stomach
the tuna the tuna and the and the
octopus and yeah
you could have taken a laxative and
transferred it to it
we didn't think to bring laxat wait i
might be able to help you with that you
do have a medical yeah he's got a
medical bag
if only you thought of this before yeah
all right you can knock out the door
can i all right yeah make me a
16 yeah all right that is very good yeah
you feel
so you lose four magic points
and everybody you all notice
um yes i'm fine
do you need to use one of your three
bathrooms
no no i'm listening do you have food
poisoning do we have food poisoning
there's no poison here was it the
octopus
no no i i'm sure franz is fine i'm just
uh
something i ate didn't agree with me at
that point i'll come out
all right sorry it took me a little
while
oh geez are you okay because he's not
okay
yeah just a little little feeling a
little so
hopefully okay yeah i'm not feeling
i'm not feeling so great either i'll be
i'll be right back
i'm too genuinely concerned right now
about what i ate
i know me thank god i didn't eat any of
it
um all right yeah he he seems to be like
um he seems to be a little he was a
little green at the start but he seems
to be like
he he has a glass of water and he's kind
of doing a little better
uh alexandra what are you up to oh
welcome
bless you he's untouched bless you um
yeah i
i'm gonna aim toward it toward the
bathroom and just and just like start
looking around
um any anything that's interesting in
the kitchen anything that's interesting
off in that direction
so the bathroom is the opposite
direction from the kitchen he doesn't
sorry i was thinking of restaurants that
i've worked in where the kitchen and the
bathrooms are pretty close to
each other no he wants he doesn't want
any part of
i guess my real question is would i
be able to
to come around from behind him if i'm
coming in from the bathroom
no because so you come out of the of the
dining room
there's the door to the kitchen which is
the kitchen is only connected to the
dining room
there's the door to the hallway
and the bathroom is down the hallway to
the left so you'd be coming back
in through the only door into the uh
dining room
okay are there any other rooms down this
hallway
uh yes but there's also
a a deep one who
so there's three doors on this one and
then there's a deep one standing where
the
okay what are the other three rooms i'm
sorry they look like
closets of some sort
okay and is the deep one watching me are
you are you just gonna start opening
doors
i mean if the deep one isn't watching me
yes
you don't know if he's watching you he's
just standing in the in the he's about
you know search for the restroom search
for about a hundred feet away
yeah yeah yeah all right i i don't know
where the restroom is i'm gonna start
opening doors looking for it there is a
i clearly i am exactly as stupid as
stanford thinks i am
it's your house so you gotta label it so
the first one the first door that you
open
the bathroom is the middle door this
door seems to be
uh a cleaning room okay
and oh did
she find savannah's body just draped in
there
no we're borrowing the ammonia and
bleach
uh i'm sure there's bleach no i'm
kidding i'm i'm
yeah but yeah it's a it's it seems to
be mainly cleaning materials
the second one is the bathroom which i
guess you don't open
um and the third one is
um you open it and you are inside
a it's a wall of cans
there are just late unlabeled cans
there's about seven unlabeled cans on
the wall
on a shelf like paint cans or
yeah they're about paint can sized okay
i'm curious and that's dangerous but i
am curious
so are they open on the top or are they
they are sealed
do they look like the sort of field
where i could pry the top off
um make me a spot hidden roll
okay
uh 56 regular success all right each of
the
uh as you go up and you like try and
look at them each of them is like
almost socketed into this shelf uh
so the bottom is connect the bottom of
the um
okay does it look like so there's
there's room for like for like leverage
that i can like get up on tiptoes and
look at it or
it look i mean it looks like you could
this is a terrible idea and i'll go
ahead and do that with one of them just
like turn it
carefully to see what kind of give it
has
all right so it turns um
about a half turn and then it comes
loose
okay and as soon as it comes loose
does it sound like any voice that i know
no
i need water after that
just like funk turn it back into place
all right as soon as you click it back
in the sound stops
uh and then the deep one sticks his
head in the closet
you and not be on her i'm so sorry i got
lost looking for the water closet
it's the one that says water closet i
missed that completely thank you
you are as dumb as stanford said you are
well he's he's the one who's going to
rule the world
so probably yes his majesty
and he closes the door and he walks he
waddles back you refer to your king and
by his last name
he is he's ignoring you as you go to the
um taro will
uh back in the room uh
taro eats his dessert with with
aplomb
he he has eaten everything and once
he's eaten
he says and so mr stanford
what is your offer to japan
oh i've i've already communicated it
to to your emperor
all you have to do is swear fealty to me
and negotiations
are continuing and i think going very
promisingly
i look forward to working with you
commander stanford
i think she just did the ritual of
transference nick
okay i got back here that's what i
was gonna do it
i have communicated with
most of the other members larger members
demonstration
i lean over and i'm just like who's not
and emma gets a primer on geopolitical
uh did we start eating dessert oh yes
there is a lovely row all right so
but i mean you have you've gotten pretty
good at uh
doing so and i'm far enough i'm not
sitting near him
okay so yeah make me make me a power
roll
no not this time do we want to
inspiration
26 yes all right yeah
so uh
oh crap oh crap oh crap i hate when he
does that me too
just fumbled um
you immediately
gain 30 pow
whoa
cool and stanford
like goes white as a sheet and he opens
oh
ah and he like starts to like stagger up
am i coming back anytime soon is it the
fish
was it the fish yeah i'm like just take
my food and just
keep pushing it yeah you will come
down the hall as he like staggers to the
door
i'll like reach out ahead are you all
right
no oh
i can't believe she did this to me what
did she do
i didn't see this coming i'll like reach
out and put a hand on on his shoulder to
like steady him
oh why would she uh
and he he's gonna like he like
i have to go talk to someone and he
starts to like go down the hall
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it yeah i'm gonna let him get a
little bit ahead of me just like square
my shoulders all right better now than
never and come up behind him
put a hand on his shoulder and and stab
up all right
stab him all right so you put a hand on
his shoulder
and you bring the knife out and as the
knife goes towards him
the blade just starts to melt hmm he's
like oh come on
can't do that you know i can't do that
uh is it turning into like molten metal
i don't i don't want to kill you i have
to go talk to someone
who are you talking to oh god you
wouldn't want to know
yes i do oh go away
this is the last time i'm gonna tell you
no oh god all right fine
and he pulls out his whistle and he
i assume that we're all looking down the
door at this yeah yeah
you've all leaned out but
but but is the dagger like molten the
daggers just ceases to be
fun
you it's not just
go away and he's like still just trying
like you like
you you're basically walking along with
him with your hand on his shoulder
i meant but i said i'm not gonna kill
you
what just happened but i think for your
own safety you need to get out of here
as has been pointed out to me recently i
don't give much of a toss for my own
safety
and you see coming from deeper in the
mountains so he's walking away
from the volcano part of it deeper into
the mountain
i'm keeping pace with stanford as much
as i can what are we doing
there's so they're about to turn a cor
they're about to turn
a corner where you won't see them
anymore should we go the spiders or
those two all of them what are we doing
let's go
like i'm staying right here
no we can't let her go by herself i'm
going yeah wherever the spiders are i
don't want to be
at us the spiders are coming towards
alexandra and
i'm going i'm going all right lamb is
out the door
yep and and and and going after them
yep i'm not just sitting there
it you you can almost see him like
and how can if i say something to
hollister taro can hear right
uh yes okay so i'm gonna get to the door
i'm gonna get to the door be like
hollister come here
yeah i'll i'll move with you
sure so as long as taro can't hear us
i'm like we need to
disassemble whatever's happening
downstairs so that taro doesn't get it
how are we how are we dealing with the
fish men
right now they're not a problem
quite we're about to do something to
directly make them a problem
i mean what are our choices follow those
two into
i don't know i i think splitting up's a
bad idea if we're gonna turn this into a
suicide mission
i hate to say it but we should do it
right
all right let's go grab my sword let's
do this
all right so you two are going to the
left towards the volcano
is that i guess
all right so lamb and alexandra going to
the right you
two going to the left all right so um
you two going to the left you will get
out there's
there's a the deep one at the door is
kind of not
he he's just sort of standing there for
now
um but you see coming up the coming up
the actual wall of the volcano
is just a mass of these spiders
just this horrible undulating mass
of spiders like skittering up the wall
i mean obviously i'm not going to be in
their way

pale and he's hunched over he's in bad
shape

conversation that you can't quite hear
until you get up there and you see

and he looks at two of the spiders and
he makes a symbol with his hands
and the two spiders both link

out of his mouth
like more blood than you really think
should be

like waterfall

our community you guys
who are here every week with us uh
really make my day uh
i it just you know i needed a
little pick-me-up after some of the
stuff that's gone on this week and
tonight gave it to me
uh i was not expecting poor carl
stanford to die so quickly
he invited us to dinner what did you
expect
duh nobody let me bring explosives so
something had to happen
some of you guys did what you always do
how could i not see that in the future
i'm so
naked all right i you know appear i'm
not omniscient i
i make noise either is he oh as much as
he might like to think so
i i think i actually have a
working theory that
everything he saw was in the world that
emma didn't destroy that was my sort
because he's not a constant so i was
thinking there was some i don't know
so yeah i guess there's nothing else to
say but uh
you
