last week we took care of the
gorilla issue as
flint has traveled off to japan
with iso guitaro to try and
convince the japanese to join the battle
against the black pharaoh and the evil
forces
uh and we also lost donal
at least briefly as he has gone
off with rogers to
uh have these mysterious tattoo on the
back of his neck
looked at and taken care of
and the um
the other the they made it back
from gray dragon island uh
once it became clear that nobody cared
about their presence
uh and they fled they saved many
soldiers which
many japanese sailors which was
wonderful uh
and oh speaking of which did i i
don't think i did
uh you all gained two sanity
for all of your work to save sorry dr
hollister not you
i'm not i'm writing it down for flint
flint is that right that's who's stan
so you because you worked so hard and
and
honestly put yourselves in danger to
save those sailors
uh you you each get a little sanity back
uh your humanity has been
uh reaffirmed so they they fled
uh to shanghai where taro found a
boat
and is going to get the rest of the men
uh the rest of the sailors and
left the great danes in shanghai they
are
um they're trying their best to not let
anyone else in shanghai know they're
there
that is not their skill set really
uh so it'll it'll be interesting they
then
uh the ladies of the great dane society
headed
to formerly ho fang's uh
place and they found a
column of water was connecting
hoefang's palace with presumably grey
dragon island it was off in the
direction of grey dragon island there
was a
a huge column of water and as they
watched
they could see the bloated woman
travel through that column this aspect
of nyolathotep that had been
contained in hofang's mansion uh
traveled through that tube
off towards grey dragon island um
and that was where we ended last episode
so
uh it is the evening of
the fifth yeah may 5th uh
and you are standing in front of
hofang's mansion it is raining the
weather is still bad
that column of water is still there it
is still connecting oh you also saw
um the the the weird girl who
ate dead people she also zipped up
through that tube
really quickly oh yeah we have 500 bits
from vindication to
um myself to to light something on fire
since tamagoto didn't take
responsibility for that
and then we were also raided by mad bird
stream so hi everybody nice welcome
that's exciting we have a we have a raid
uh so does that mean
what a raider means thomas is like
as he's busy drinking a soda i was like
all right we'll see
we'll see it depends on how good the
raiders are i guess that's
it i'm just imagining that that little
flesh-eating girl is like a surprise
like stanford's not expecting he's
like what the
not her oh i would love that that's
extra
extra yes so you three
in front of ho fang's palettes
i'm not oh yeah joe wasn't there because
she's with the
interpreter that's right is guarding the
interpreter
um so instead it is oh god what was my
name for you two
slash and burn slash and burn flash and
burn
instead it is slash and burn i
would encourage them
i love it i think it's a great name for
alexandria and emma
we were you know it's what was that the
other one was like
i did alex and m alex and m was the
first one and then we had to go from
there because
that it was good but not we needed to
hack it up a notch
yeah and it wasn't like also kind of
like cagney and lacy it sounded like
something in the dagger lady
what was the other one you know what
we're not gonna do any more gi joe
moments from now on it's
too bad nobody knows anything about that
show okay
hey man i brought up i brought up turbo
teen last time i can go deep on this
you can make it up and nobody'd correct
you oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] torah 500 of the party if
emma meets
back up back up with madame lynn i don't
even understand what that means
well meets back up with like oh she
would want you to get together
got it it's a meet-up okay it's yeah oh
is that what the kids call it these days
a meet up
apparently to meet up uh
and yeah all right uh
i used to watch cagney and lacey that's
when time daily was still
uh when she was not playing
uh mother roles and now grandmother
roles as she usually plays
um so yeah you are you are you two are
in
front of hofang's palace and it seems
like you know it's as quiet as it's ever
been
is the water fountains gone away no that
that is still
shooting that column is still
going towards gray dragon hut i'm going
to reject
these 500 bits for elder brat one
for emma to convince the department for
madame lin to join the party
i'm going to take them but i'm also
going to reject them
but take them to i don't know
put them in the boy yeah we'll put them
in reserve we'll put them for
we'll put them for gifts and prizes
later
there we go
so the two of you are now like
standing in front of this thing
uh both of you make me spot hidden rolls
oh that was one other thing last episode
we did
uh all of our skill checks so uh
everybody started starting fresh on the
skill
no very birds of paradise
two baby two whom all right
um i see everything what would you like
me to see
i see london i see france i
imagine i'm still in shock because i
threw i threw the rock at
the at the column and that was when
it started doing the wavy back and forth
thing so i'm just like
i might have just screwed up
uh so you see
uh clearly as soon as the bloated
lady goes shooting off through the tube
um from a side street you see
someone slink off
like someone had been watching the the
the palace and when that happened they
slink off and actually with an o2
you see that there are there are
there's there are other there's at least
one other person there that is staying
around
they don't appear to have seen you yet
okay
so i just i'm like alexander
alexander some guy just went down that
off
it looked like a male figure right yeah
yep some guy just went down that alley
want me to like sneakily down that alley
not just walk down that alley
do you want me to go stab him well not
yet
i mean let's let's get on the bike and
go ask him what's up first
remember there's another person there
like so someone is still watching the
building but
one of the the people who's watching the
building has left
but i'm pointing that i'm i'm hoping
that alexander can see that because i'm
pointing at the guy
you know in my usual
i i i will refrain from getting on the
bike actually because if i want to
approach quietly
bicycle chains in the rain tend to not
be very quiet
so are you going after the guy who snuck
away or the people who
stuck around i think after the guy who
left because that's someone who has a
direct interest in the bloated lady i
think
he was part of this group okay you're
not sure
it's probably it looks like three or
four people who have
clearly been watching this mansion
they've been
for whatever reason three people one
person
i think i'm gonna go after the one
person i might i might end up dying a
little a little bit slower
all right emma are you gonna
follow along or are you staying yeah but
at a distance because and i'm going to
leave the bike at a distance though
because i'm not that sneaky
okay yeah my stealth is okay but not
great yeah all right alexandra make a
uh yes all right so yeah you
um you are you are able to he's moving
kind of he's moving very cautiously
uh so he actually gets a bonus die
i'm gonna use gm inspiration wow okay
already dipping into the pile
i am so glad i used a i'm so glad i used
birds of paradise
but b i'm so glad i used gm inspiration
that's a zero not a 60.
[Music]
uh so he
he notices you coming after him and then
he speeds up
okay i'm i'm going i'm gonna drop
stealth and just go
okay yeah you will uh
you will catch up with him because he
stops and he turns around
um and he is clearly brandishing a a
okay he says something to you in chinese
and i just look at him and sigh and say
do i really look like
make me an education role
uh 50. all right so in the next
blast of things he says in chinese you
distinctly hear the words
and he is he's essentially indicating
like
beat it and so emma you come up on this
as
this guy has a gun and
um he and alexander are not trying to
hide anything
i i i don't currently have a knife out
but i have my hand very casually on one
of the places where i can draw one
you almost all yeah you have there's a
knife around you at all times
oh yeah yeah as i said pre-show am i
dressed then i have knives and if not
there's one under my pillow
we call you the scabbard
uh i'm gonna just walk past that one
because
i don't know what i said but i'm glad
i'm glad i don't know what i said
uh so he is again he speaks
he's making no attempt to speak english
he is
holding the gun and
now that there are two of you he's
gotten a little more amped up
i'm just i'm i'm gonna look over at emma
and say
he's with our favorite gorilla uh
let's just back up and get out of here
she'll know she'll know that we're back
well i mean it's either that or somehow
you're gonna i'm hoping he doesn't
understand i like looks
kind of side eye to see if he's
understanding i mean how are you gonna
kill him when he's got a gun
and see does he register that that what
i just said
uh no he does not seem to understand
english
okay i've never ever killed someone who
it's not really what i meant but it's
kind of what i meant
if you want to just walk away so i can
deal with this you can
okay call me back though because we
then take him back to the tournament the
water tornado and see what happens when
his his science his fellow clients
there is no innocent blood yeah science
i am so upset i'm missing science
this is a priming this is a prime
experiment we must test this
hypothesis i i will i will point out
that
a few of his fellows are still there and
i don't know about you but i can't carry
a body stealthily and huck it over a
wall
hmm
yeah we're in kind of a situation so
he's gonna start
like backing out of the the street
backing down the street i'm i'm i'm
gonna take a step forward
i'm just just raising an eyebrow he like
all right so
he'll like yell something in chinese and
he like brandishes the revolver again
um i'm just wondering should we should
we just get out of here
and just like as long as he doesn't
follow us as long as we're not being
followed back
our favorite gorilla will know we're
back in town which means she will think
that our friend is and she will hunt him
down
but our favorite gorilla has to find us
first yes
because it's difficult to and to assume
our favorite gorilla is a pretty good
band name too
i'm trying not to use her name in front
in front of this guy
so if you genuinely think that i that i
should back off
i will but i i think it is an enormous
risk
okay i'm gonna go hide behind a dumpster
cool
you start to like move away
starts to move away this guy uh
he like again takes starts to take a
couple steps back
thinking you know if one of you is
leaving you're probably both leaving
and i'm and and i'm gonna move forward
and draw a dagger as i go
i mean he's got the drop on you
so we're gonna go into initiatives okay
uh with a readied firearm he's gonna go
before you
all right that adds to his so he's gonna
shoot
i would like to use some gm inspiration
okay
i love how you're shooting through it
i'm a little disappointed you know i
it doesn't look like a magic face nope
that was not nope alas he was very close
if he had luck to spend he'd spend it
but he don't
uh so so a shot rings out
kablam and it's not that late
uh and so you will spend this round
getting to him
and and and and draw and draw in one and
draw one of them
knives out no problem that was an
excellent film by the way
yes i have stolen that accent for
many characters now
um i mean what is
chauvinism's got to be good for
something he's going to try and just
club you with the uh
not realizing what this poor fellow has
gotten himself into he's going to try
and pistol whip you
oh that's better you should make a dodge
roll
that is a 24 that is a hard success
all right he he is now starting to
realize what he's gotten himself into
as he like comes forward and
he's almost like fine and he like
he likes just lashes out at you and you
dance out of the way and he goes
uh-oh you're
you have the you have the initiative now
and as and as and as part of that like
uh flow flowing dance move to get out of
the way i come up
up and around with with my knife to
slash at him all right do it
uh 37 is a hard success
nope he's not gonna dodge that one so uh
yeah do your damage
uh hard success is full damage yes that
is six
that is six points of damage all right
he did not enjoy that
you you stabbed him but good and he
um he is bleeding quite a bit
and he like lets out a ah but he lets
out a yowl
uh and
man he's gonna run so he like
he's gonna throw the pistol at you and
try and run and so what that's gonna do
is
uh we're gonna make dex rolls
and you have a penalty die on this one
because he threw the gun at you
okay oh there that's what i need
oh man even with a penalty day i got an
oh geez which which is a hard success
wow so so this poor guy who is now
so far over in over his head he uh
he like slides across a uh
he's running and like there's a there's
a cart coming through and he like dukes
of hazard slides across it
and he's like i am getting away no
problem
and then you just vault over it and you
are right behind him
he surrenders he just stops and he puts
his hands up
okay and he's saying something in
chinese
um in in a semi-crowded street he's just
like
saying things to you kind of
i don't know they sound like god it's so
hard to say what they sound like in
chinese because it's a tonal language
but but but but i could interpret it as
pleading perhaps i mean he's put his
hands up
fair um
and he's apparently no longer armed yeah
that's true
so yeah i'm i'm going to ease back a
step because we are in a semi-crowded
street i also don't understand what he's
saying
and i feel like i might have the whole
street on me if i if i continue
and he is bleeding quite well
[Music]
sorry donald stop you stop making
commentary in the chat
no keep it up keep it up we're writing a
backstory for this poor guy so when he
dies it'll be extra tragic
clearly he pulls out the wallet with
like the eight kid pictures
yeah and i'll and i'll ask quietly do
he says something in chinese i'll take
uh only words he know in english
are madam lin um
say madame lim lin excuse me
and try to pantomime out
do not tell her about us
and i'm not sure how i would go about i
would love to see this
phantom for this is a visual medium
all right apologies to podcast
listeners
so i will say madame lynn
and like glance in the direction of
where where of where i know her house to
be because we've been there often enough
and like gesture him
and and and and at the house and then
i'm gonna make an intelligence roll for
him wow
um he seems really focused on the you
pant on the pantomime stabbing thing
because you didn't put your dagger away
nope and so you're like stabbing the air
and he's like
that's that seems to be his takeaway all
right
he he says you know
again he puts his hand you know he's got
he's keeping his hands up
and he says something that now really
sounds like plaintive
um i don't know maybe
i'll i'll i'll say madame lynn
and shaking my head for the podcast he
looks very confused
and he says language barriers are hard
you know speak
okay okay okay yes
okay
all right and and i don't know and i'll
i'll i'll i'll wipe the dagger and i
hang on a handkerchief and put it away
as soon as you put it away he starts
running away
and i'm gonna glance around and see just
how much of an audience this this dumb
show has attracted people watching
especially as people started yelling
madame lynn
i'm sure that's when people started
watching
um so i'll i'll clean my blade put it
away glance around and head back toward
emma
you hear the you hear police whistles
near where the gunshot was
oh emma get out of there you're close
bye
crawling around under like down on the
ground underneath and behind stuff just
behind like garbage and what not trying
to like get away
yeah i'll all circle around where where
we were uh
going like straight staying
counterclockwise to
uh the the police whistles as much as i
can so i don't encounter them
while i'm coming around and looking for
emma sure
sure yeah you you you find each other
and
you you want to head back to the mansion
where do you want to go
i want to go see if those three
gentlemen are still standing there right
there's three left
okay so uh
i'm gonna need stealth roles to make
sure that they don't see you coming
this is an opposed role oh
i think i made it that is a hard success
for me
just a regular success all right yeah
they
are still there one of them seems to
have field glasses
with a hard success you'll see that uh
and
they seem to be very focused on the
mansion
okay
i don't know if they will i don't know
if they would or not but
what's worse is that oh where's that
where's that guy by the way
where did where is he where'd you stash
him
[Music]
he he surrendered and
i have rules so i
attempted to make it clear that he
doesn't tell madam lin about this
we'll find out how successful i was
so pack our bags and leave town wasn't
that wasn't that always a plan
that's me the name
[Laughter]
plan b pack our bags and leave town i
mean you know he's not going you know
i mean he seemed he's awfully surprised
by by by the fact that he wasn't able to
lay a finger on me and i gashed his side
pretty good
maybe that will persuade him that i'll
come find him in his sleep like a demon
or something i don't know
she's an 800 pound gorilla she's gonna
she's gonna beat it out of them
or just beat them to death i don't know
which one i
based on what flint was saying about her
uh temperament i think that's much more
likely
that also creates a problem because
she's either going to be looking for us
and they're going to now be watching
this place for us to show back up
because i really want to see what's what
else is inside there
[Music]
well we would have to come back with
joan because that's the only way that we
can get in
uh go and explore everything
without drowning
so i don't know maybe we come back
tomorrow morning
or i i i don't know i think we should
pull back for tonight
oh absolutely i've just one i'm just
wondering
what kind of artifacts are in that house
still
that could potentially help us it got so
remind me
uh correct me if i'm wrong azure but i
thought that the house got raised to the
ground and all of the pieces
pulled through the the cylinder of water
because it was shooting back and forth
and breaking everything that house the
house is gone
okay i don't think there's much left
honestly
and you know from where from your
vantage point which is not as good as
the vantage point of the three guys who
have the
the setup but it looks like there isn't
okay
yeah i i honestly don't think there's
anything left here anymore the bloated
lady is
on gray dragon island for better or
worse along with that scary scary
maybe she's hungry for tank that'd be
nice
okay let's go my quotes could be used
um also brayden five-ish
500 bits for science i'm still very
tempted to tell somebody
i'm very very tempted to throw somebody
into the uh
the water tornado i mean we could
probably overpower someone we're
currently still stealth from them
you say it don't do it three to two
i mean i need a diversion
someone in the water would be the
diversion
the problem is that i am not i am
dexterous i am not strong
and i'm neither and hauling a a
terrified squirming person
unless i come up behind them and cut
their throat and then well
they're still terrified but not
yeah i say let's go let's get out of
here all right so you head back and you
are
you are circumspect in traveling back to
the to the warehouse
uh as you were coming here you don't
feel like you're followed
um and when you get there uh
joan is like when she hears the door
joan is there with the crowbar like
ready in case anybody's coming in
um so you're gonna spend the night in
the warehouse there is
it's i mean it's more comfortable than a
japanese destroyer
uh so that's not terrible but but
it's not you know
your usual nice hotel room you're you're
sleeping on cots
um and about
five in the morning oh you're uh
your translator asks if he can go home
and come back
is he done yet he's not going to work
all night
he said i i i i'm just afraid that
uh at this point if you go home you
won't be able to come back
i have a family i know and i want to get
you there as soon as possible
am i getting paid
um we're gonna pay you and we'll make
sure you get back to your fam
i mean he is not the sort of person that
will try and sneak out when
so he's gonna like he like begrudgingly
goes
you know there might be you know you
might hear a little sniffle or two as he
uh and at five in the morning
uh there is a bright light
in the in the room as a
familiar door opens in the middle of the
room
and outsteps donald with another
gentleman dr hollister introduce
yourself
i'm going to wake everyone up the light
takes i am awake as soon as as soon as
that light hits my face i'm
up and moving and and already have a
dagger in my hand these are
the oh there's no there's no need for
that but i'm
not all who did you bring back with you
well this fellow here is a doctor dr
um
hollister is the fellow he's been
working on my neck and
he insisted on returning for whatever
reason
well you're still healing and i wanna i
wanna make sure that you're all right
i'm fine well i'm gonna make sure of
that
donald has a massive bandage along the
hello and i'm going to put the dagger
away in a
sorry you startled me oh you know
magic doors opening middle of the night
uh the door has closed by the way
can i bring everything with me yeah you
have your equipment
so it is so for you guys you were in dc
so it feels like it's the middle of the
aft
i don't know what time 5 am is in in in
shanghai from dc
but i'm going to say you left in the
middle of the afternoon
yeah it would be like f yeah it would be
afternoon
probably so like to singapore 7 p.m here
is 10 a.m there
is jet lag a term yet
and and instantaneous travel does not
cause jet lag
i'm still gonna i figure i'll have to
take a nap to try to
i mean you're gonna be up for a it's
gonna be a long day and it's weird to
you that you know it's
it's dark here that's well it was i
think it was expected
yeah yeah yeah i knew what i was getting
myself into yeah they had the wallet
you know i i'm also here to help with uh
any therapeutic needs you might have
it's my understanding that you've all
been under a terrible amount of stress
and i would say my door is open to
you but well that one just closed and
don't really have an office here
great can i go back to sleep now
[Laughter]
by all means well
shut up welcome to the great dane
society
you poor bastard i'm gonna go and sit
down at my cod again
uh dr hollister are you wearing like
a dog are you wearing like a dwight
jacket are you like are you wearing like
street clothes
i'm wearing street clothes i figure i'm
not going to
go around advertising that's like almost
if like i showed up in like the military
fatigues that they were wearing back in
the bunker
right well i'm going to pull him aside
and chat with him because i want to make
sure that this is indeed a doctor
and and of psychology maybe perhaps like
he's saying
medicine uh
you make a psychology role joan uh
hollister also make a psychology role
i'm not i'm not a psychologist
per se i more study the mind than uh
than anything else oh no a bit short
all right yeah he i mean you you might
have
asked him some you know you yeah you
you know you know you know some shysters
and he does not seem like a shyster
okay so i'm pretty upfront about the
things that i don't know
like i'll describe to you like how i i
understand the brain working and the man
the mechanics behind it and some of
the
you know a couple of the experiments
that i've done
the experiments tend to involve a lot of
electrocuting things
whoa and a radiation hold on all right
so when i hear about the electric i'm
going to ask him if he's the one who
who put yosef in in in that in the
electric chair oh i didn't place him in
it
but you created the chair didn't you
that was some great talking around
i can't take full credit for that i i
i you know my research definitely
uh was a significant contributing factor
to making it
i is is joseph gonna be able to survive
this
i mean every time we see him he looks
like he's in utter pain
i personally i wouldn't
recommend a prolonged
use but i
but you're here
yes yes that's that
i i've made my recommendations as to how
i believe it should be used
uh based on the contributions that i've
made
and you're not listening rodgers has
made his
decisions with those recommendations
in mind
so basically they're not paying
attention to you anymore after you made
this uh
some concessions were made but uh
all right i made i totally made my psych
role what do i think of this guy now
he everything he has said is true he
is clearly
uh he's answering
truthfully but slightly evasively but
you know when he's telling you he helped
make
he told you he helped make it you know
um
he told you that he doesn't recommend
being locked into that thing for a long
time
but you know so he believes all that but
he doesn't seem to be he i don't see any
like
empathy or being any of that kind of
stuff
for that person i just see like oh yeah
no i told them and they didn't do it
i mean yeah it seems i mean
i don't know you haven't had a lot of
experience with military but it seems
you know this is what kind of what you
think chain of command is like you know
i made my recommendation and my superior
officer said here's the way it's going
to be and i
said yes okay okay okay
all right oh no we'll check in with
alexandra if she's still awake and just
asking her what's been going on and so
forth
yeah she's she's she's still awake and
sitting on her cot um
and looks up and smiles how you feeling
it's like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] frankly it's it's um
it's not really healed but they tell me
it was a successful surgery how long
have i been gone it seems like just a
day
it has been about a day right so it
should take a little while to
yeah there let's see interesting
highlights um
flint has decided to go to japan with
taro i don't think you were here for
that discussion
oh i think i think he was that's right i
think so
i don't think so oh yes yes you were
you're gonna tell rogers about that
um i remember that's right um
we we went to hofang's compound
you can tell me about it later if you
like it was
it was more odd than anything else there
was a good listening check
i would like to i would like to mosey on
over to that conversation
i'm gonna follow him all right close
side of this conversation
do i notice this it's hard
i'm not entirely unsubtle yeah um
he like comes over and he's like looking
at the back of flint's neck
like you know like that's his that's his
cover
mm-hmm and i'm going and i'm gonna pause
as
he's doing that and just wait
how close am i to this conversation
you're it's a it's not a big warehouse
so you're all i just get up and take my
crap
and like just loudly as loud just drag
my cot across
the like across the warehouse
be like i am trying
to sleep no
nobody's asleep now because you people
will not be quiet
and he's like is it time to go back to
work
no yes five o'clock in the morning let
the man sleep
which one we're not letting me sleep
nobody's sleeping i'll i'll
i'll stand up and and like gesture for
for donald to
come with me and and again i imagine i
mentioned there's like a side room at
like one of the conference rooms that
we'd met tara when once before
and i'm gonna make i'm gonna try to make
sure that hollister doesn't follow them
because i can tell alexandre by her
expression i'm going to ask to join i i
actually i'm
incredibly fascinated in uh
this i i've heard something about this
manner
if you want to be part of the
conversation you you don't have to sneak
over and pretend
i'm sure joan can fill you in it's fine
doctor
i'll be fine thank you for your work we
we we would have filled joan in though
before
okay because i mean we we would have
told her what what happened and that you
know any artifacts that are there are
gone the scary thing you gotta do
all right so i can i'll just say let
them have a let them have a second they
haven't he hasn't seen him for a while
let
them have a second i'm have a second
yeah i'll i'll i'll draw donald aside
and and phil and kill him
i could tell by her her face she's like
hmm
can i see donald's face from where i'm
at
um so it's it's
very early in the morning at this point
the um
the poor the the poor uh
translator is like
going to he's going to like
uh he puts a coffee pot on the on the
on the little wooden sta on the cast
iron stove
that heats this place and he's just like
sighing and he like
and he seems to be swearing under his
breath in chinese
swearing has a certain international
flavor to it
yes you can hear the guttural tone and
so i'm gonna i'm gonna say uh
let's yeah let's make it let's make
something to eat doctor let's come over
here and see what we got
and i'm gonna come over to where the the
uh
the translator is and tell them that
we're really sorry that we didn't
expect unexpected visitors here
and i introduce him to dr hollister
hollister do you speak any chinese
no all right um
you had an opportunity to make a brand
new character and he didn't make
somebody spoke chinese
come on doesn't fit the character that's
right
uh the the translator is like more now
openly like muttering under his breath
yeah and he'll he'll like he'll sit
there for as long as it takes to like
make
the coffee and rice he will pointedly
not make enough for
anyone but yep yep all right
that's and i i i'll introduce him just
say you know we had
unexpected guests dr hollister is going
to be with us for a little while he's
looking after donald
and then we'll leave him alone i'll
leave him alone
let him do what he needs to do um
he looks he says i will be finished
today
sounds good for all of us please prepare
uh so yeah he'll go sit at his table
with eating rice
some sort of porridge that he just
whipped up it smells quite good actually
and
and drinking coffee and uh
great it's about six in the morning
yeah i'm gonna start making breakfast
they're gonna need it and emma will wake
up when she smells it
yeah i i i start smelling the coffee and
i'm drawn out of when
i when i start smelling out after after
filling donald on everything that
happened
okay so
are you is the plan to just wait until
he finishes the translation are you guys
gonna do anything today
it's now may 6th yep
was your was your leave was the full
moon
yep the eighth was a full moon i'm
actually concerned that we may have to
oh
did thomas just just laugh at the notion
he was trying to sneak in between rooms
and he just used
he just stopped right there just started
laughing i was like get out
fair enough um
yeah and and i would have told donald
about the
the person from madame lin and how i'm
fairly sure
i've i think i scared him badly enough
that that he won't unlock her but
you know he thinks you're gonna kill
madame lin
cool so how long do we need to stay in
this town
just just until this translation is done
and
we need to yeah it's either that or if
we can within two days
figure out what the capstone would be
for
the bloated woman i mean we're missing
so many pieces here
we're missing what is that capstone
we're missing where is that container
that
she needs to be contained into we
also have the issue of
and i look at the doctor i'm gonna look
at the doctor again and be like the
flesh tank
the zombies the vampire girl
stanford yeah
another boat ride and and and alexandria
visibly twitches
at the mention of the zombies where
where do we think the bloated lady
would would have been hidden away what's
where would that be what i don't know
anything about
this culture or where they would entomb
their
team and then look at joan like where
were they
yeah where where you could try and
what would i roll to figure out the
message i just made it i just made it
during this conversation what would you
roll to find what i'm sorry
like to feel out the mental state like
i'm trying to figure out if anyone is
yeah psycho psychoanalysis role
joan you you think that it's possible
it was that temple it's possible
that it's great dragon island yeah it's
possible that it's one of those pyramids
that was being discussed
you know since pyramids have sort of
been in the thing the theme
it seems like there's a couple of of
options there
gray dragon island's clearly symbolic
for something it was
you know it was the the locus of those
points
but shanghai was one of those points as
well
and just as clearly we are not getting
to that island at least not at the
moment
but joan you said shanghai was one of
the points is that is that right
that's what we understood was one of the
points but we didn't figure out exactly
i said that but let me just double check
that i was going to say
i don't think it was because it was the
it was only a point in the middle of the
ocean not actually shanghai and then
there was one in australia obviously one
at the pyramid
yeah the point great dragon island is
actually the point is that's the one
that's near shanghai okay that's why
that's why we thought it was that okay
so
but but we do have the materials
i mean do we i mean you know these are
you need a drum yeah but i thought these
were
specific i thought this was specific to
egypt
so yeah you do not have the eye of light
and darkness
um that you would need to make for
whatever this is
right so so that would need to happen
um it's it's probably not likely that
happens in two days
yeah i i i think that if we're going to
take advantage
of the full moon it's it's going to
be
it's going to have to be egypt because
we have the pieces
of the eye of light and darkness we're
going to have the ritual and all of the
component parts to it or at least all of
the the knowledge that we need for it
by the end of today yes with what the
gentleman was saying
i think our best bet is going to be
egypt why are you looking at me like
that
i i i say to dr hollister
i'm looking at everyone equally you just
happen to be the one
yeah he so he has this this habit of
like staring
deeply at like whoever like just sort of
rotating looking at people um
in a very you know in a very
soothing not soothing in a very calm but
i'm used to judging i have italian
parents i was gonna say
i'm i'm i'm i'm in the arts i'm used to
uh did you make that role nick i was
eight short
close but no cigar you could spend some
luck i could
but i'm not gonna you could do we want
to let him roll again
i'll push it is it is is it to the
group's advantage because right now i
don't know this guy from
i don't know this guy from we need to
bring him into the fold
that and and if he's evaluating sanity
uh meta gaming just a tiny bit
psychology can help with that
well i mean i i i was i was like
but the reason that i am here is that
you are all under and i'll even say this
right now you it is my understanding
that
you are all under exceptional stress
and there is
no recorded literature on how people
cope with that
sleep with grenades it's very it's very
much
in our best interest to make sure that
you are all
healthy and functional if you're going
you haven't been told much about us have
you i've been we
we have never been healthy or functional
that's
the problem that's why i'm here
functioning okay
so after that speech no i second the
bits after that i
heard them yeah i think
too short do it it's okay here's the
thing
like i'm gonna i'm just gonna stress and
make it clear
as i said before my door is open if
anyone needs to talk to me
uh i don't even know how to begin to to
assess
how this could impact any of you are you
are you
been assigned to trail after us as we go
on doing things
is that your assignment well my my main
assignment
is to look after donald and his recovery
but we would definitely like to know
more about
what we are dealing with and and how we
can
prepare and understand the the pressures
how much they tell you hollister
mostly high level information just
major events
people's heads falling off people
being turned into
animals okay
you do know about that other things that
are more personal to some
of you which i don't think is
uh great to bring up if you want to talk
about them
that could apply to every single one of
them
[Laughter]
oh yes so how how how
how well on his way to being fully i
don't even know the words right now
to be fully functional for donal
recovered yes yeah i mean i'm being
completely honest i have no idea
but but assuming assuming no
magical side effects
his his recovery seems remarkable i
running and jumping and fisticuffs
what is that nick doesn't have the
medicine for that but his character does
yeah you you would say you know you
would like him to not do much for a week
really yeah i mean i amount of skin that
was taken off
yeah i don't have that most likely like
not i did i probably didn't want him
leaving like what the same day
yeah how often am i sticking him with
morphine
donald has not asked for anything geez
yeah donald's a badass i definitely want
to keep an eye on him
i'm sure so we have to remark upon he
has asked for whiskey
on numerous occasions though that's
that's just every day that's like
breakfast lunch and dinner that's not
right
so you've been you've been told uh
doctor about some of the things that
we've been up to
and what we what we need to do and what
our our purpose is
are you going to be coming along with us
and what else
can you do other than just try to get in
our brains
uh i'll be with you for at least a while
um i certainly would like to see
donald's full recovery if
any important information that i could
bring back to
[Music]
better prepare our men i think that i
would like to stay for that
uh as for what i can contribute
i do know how to use a firearm
medical electronics biology chemistry
i prefer not to use the firearm
i understand that but i mean how how
many times have we looked at each other
and said it would be really nice to have
a doctor right about now
all right so he can help us scour
this whole place for
uh supplies that we can take with us
because we're gonna have to go
doctor when you say better prepare the
for the man for what prepare the men for
what
we're dealing with things that
and because i didn't see them come
through the portal and help us on great
dragon island
well to be fair we didn't exactly make
it no i'm
please forgive me was that
so what you're saying is that next time
we don't well we don't always know
what's going to be happening
when we go to certain different places
because
you know that there's there's magic and
there's all sorts of other things
i can guarantee something's going to
blow up i can guarantee
the duchess is gonna show up on a boat i
can guarantee now
what else is gonna happen what yeah i
was like what huh
[Music]
oh you'll meet her i'm sure we'll we'll
tell you that on the way
um oh and also that that we will go
through at least one of our
of of our hotels probably by setting one
of them on fire
yes i am familiar with that that is that
there are detailed
surprisingly detailed records of that
how how many how many of those records
uh
uh you also have the ability
to you know you you have
a conduit to rogers that maybe the group
hasn't had
and so you know whether or not you want
to like
tell them this you could probably get
access to a doorway
especially if you had a good reason for
it i actually assume they can
too so i probably wouldn't bring it up
it'll probably come up at some point
like why don't we use the doorway
well yeah that's exactly because i mean
i'm thinking we've only got two days to
get to egypt
well and and i'm i'm hoping that we
would be able to use
uh a doorway to to get to egypt as much
as i hate to tax
yeah but i think we should read the read
the translation first just to verify
that we have all the things before we
just pop through a doorway
because not only that i mean right now
none of us have been contaminated with
anything but who knows
who's listening both here and in the
in other regions of the world of the
universe yeah on that note i'm gonna go
i'm gonna go check on on our friend and
see if he's okay and
he's like i'm so close i'm so close
yeah i'm gonna be looking through the
papers and things like that that he's
that he's that he's there because i want
to get a sense of it i don't want this
to be a surprise
um yeah after we've like
broken apart i'm going to pick up my
coffee cup and say dr hollister
gesture him over to that room and close
the door behind us
sure i have
um first how much
of what we tell you in your position as
someone helping us deal with stress is
because there are things that i would
rather your superiors didn't know
if at all possible i
would like to be able to
share the effects of anything
supernaturally described that being said
i am i'm willing to uh
it would have to be it would have to be
with your permission to share that
information
and and we can review that at a later
date if you're comfortable with it
that makes sense how did did anything
besides you know a massive thing that
didn't feel quite like flesh
being such a relative question
i've never removed
magically infused flesh from another
person before
so in one manner of speaking the entire
thing
was it was entirely abnormal
uh on the other hand uh
all of the all of the tissue that was
marked was removed with
i would say relative ease and i'm
actually appalled at how well he's uh
he's been recovering i i can't tell if
that's due to another factor or if
that's
simply due to him that's that's just
donal
so there's there's nothing normal about
that that i can use as a frame of
reference i apologize
that's fair was was there anything
i i don't know medical stuff but we are
concerned that
the marking may have been used as a
way of listening in or tracking us
i i don't know how much you know about
the occult or any of that sort of thing
did you see any indication of something
like that
[Music]
nothing terribly useful i i ran
we're at this point we're coming up with
whatever tests that we can think of to
measure these sorts of things
there were there were variances in those
tests from standard subjects but
nothing that
that stood out as a smoking gun if that
makes any sense
um nothing exceptional
[Music]
we're just not in a position to really
be able to tell
but you were able to remove everything
that was connected to
um the the marked flesh
yes
all right thank you that would be his
entire body
other than the yeah yes
i appreciate that thank you
for your candor doctor i may
have further conversation with you at
some point not
right now i'm too tired and and like sit
sit my coffee and
and head out i do apologize for the
timing
uh it's differences in in time across
the globe
it is what it is so thank you
is unless you guys are gonna do anything
we're gonna zip to the translator
finishing
sounds good so i'm gonna make a roll for
him
montage it's just him cursing
that's pretty much what it is right
there with him so
he is going to work until 10 o'clock
tonight wow at 10 o'clock
he stands up he looks at joan and he
says
now let me go we're going to need you to
stay an extra day
and just recheck everything no no
five minutes give me five minutes to
just go through it i've been
here with you but i need to have the i
need to have that the very end can you
just
how many pages is this this is a
hundred and forty pages wow five minutes
john
handwritten no no but i've been going
through it i just want to make sure i
get the ending i have the we have the
ending and where
you know that we have all the pages in
order and i just
so he also has made he i heard
how important you thought this was so i
made this
and he pulls out a sheet of paper he he
points out a sheet of paper on the table
that is just what the three
eyes of light and darkness are yes
so one is the capstone of the of the
pyramid
okay one and in all three cases they
have those same hieroglyphics on them
uh the second one is a jade statue of
i saw inside i saw inside that temple
did i see anything that looks like that
looked like that there make me an
intelligence role
[Music]
i'm thinking did i see anything like
that at madame lin's place
emma doesn't need to make an
intelligence role alexandra you may
you you and emma both are like oh crap
because yes there is a jade statue of
the bloated woman
in madame lin's house and i'm sure we
both say oh crap
at the same time and then the third
thing
so glad lint is gone the third one
um is a um
a a pyramid made of uh
uh of glass of of fused
sand
and then the ritual is actually
pretty much exactly what brady gave you
okay the blood of innocents that has to
fill those hieroglyphics
oh it has to fill it every beat of the
jungle everyone
the hieroglyphics are not large like
when you look at the eye of light and
darkness
it is not that large and so
it is not a ton of blood but
you do have to do this for several hours
yeah do we how many hours do we have
that
it's in the google doc okay
i'll just write hours down and then i'll
the the translation is in there let's
see here i have the
yeah i pulled it up i was just trying to
reread it again it's
people's handwriting is terrible yeah
you haven't seen mine i enjoy when uh
you know when games will use
let's see here it is
[Applause]
no further than no further than 30
leagues from the uh
the eye expels it will must fill the
pupil of the eye once per drum beat from
then
to moonset and so it starts um
pupil of the eye so that's not the whole
in the hierarchy the people is the
so the afternoon before the full moon
rises
then you then you have the blood of
an innocent must fill the pupil so that
afternoon
um and there's a chant
that is also involved yep
and then when next the moon rises the
eye will open
and that is the ward in the guard and it
should be
wherever you want to ward because it
can't be moved once that has happened
right and it can only be destroyed by a
mortal
did you say mortal or immortal mortal
immortal
oh how far is 30 leagues uh
i have that for you here it's actually
sorry that's not 30 leagues it's 30 li
which is a chinese measurement and it
gives the
he will give you the translation it is
because we need to be i'm assuming it's
uh tuli is a chinese mile
so huli is about a third of a mile
so 30 30 lee would be
oh so we could potentially if we think
it's on the island
how big is the island i mean it says a
high place so if you got up on that
volcano
and put it there and i and i would bet
that the the diffused
glass is is one meant to go on to that
one
cause volcanoes
all right where do i think this jade is
the obsidian placed
where is the location that that ritual
needs to go
well you know the the
the eye of light and darkness that you
have is the capstone of an extant
pyramid
right and now we know that
the eye of light and darkness
is at madame lynn's house the second one
is at madame lin's house
the one that seals the bloated woman yes
but we don't know where it's supposed to
go
um no so okay the translation will
tell you
sorry the the the bloated woman one is
for gray dragon island that is the
blackman's home
the the the the glass pyramid
is for australia and it is for something
called the sand
bat yeah i remember hearing about this
way back in peru yep yep and there was
that australian guy
briefly okay
so we've got the egyptian capstone we we
know
where the jade statue is and we don't
have the pyramid of glass yet
and if you meet a glacier you could
possibly uh
reproduce it
all right so our our our guy
we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
somebody going to take him home or we're
he's a big mind going by himself oh i
know i'm just
joan looks around to everyone else yeah
again
we've we did not act decisively and
rescue the accountant
i'm kind of in a pickle you have all of
uh i'm not getting paid
well we've got them phones doctor
perhaps you've got some looking around
at everyone kind of
i i did convert some of my money over
yeah you have some money i mean
it's not a lot yeah well i was looking
at just like enough to
get by for myself but like how how much
you have like a couple hundred dollars
you know that you have taken out as
travel money
your government per diem for i'm taking
out my wallet and looking around kind of
like
you'll get money back from from the
heads up but
we needed to pay this guy it's part of
rogers hasn't resupplied us so you take
care of that for us
i wasn't aware that was a part of your
huh i'm sorry that you didn't get that
memo
remember this yeah well we're sorry you
didn't get that memo
yeah no one's told me how much to pay
him yet too
they're just like pay him yeah how many
think then
he's worked for us what how
much how many days yeah i don't i don't
remember it actually hasn't been
uh that it's been a depressingly short
amount
uh it's been like five maybe
five days like five days i think yeah
it's now may 6. when did he start
working for us
i don't know i don't know where did we
pick where did we get him i can't even
remember anymore
uh brady brady gave it to us when did
you meet brady
so it's been like a week i got murdered
and then
yeah the first one got murdered so yeah
so i think this has only been
it's been about a week yeah let's play
it for seven days at a daily salary
there was never an amount agreed to you
all right so no out of character guys we
know how much i roll to figure
out what would be well good compensation
yeah that's what's gonna say
make a credit rating this should should
be an accounting role really
yeah there's like a counting role first
and then fall back on a credit rating
role
yeah yeah do the accounting if anybody
else does not roll a five
all right yeah i'm fine would you like
to inspire that yeah does anybody have
any i don't have any accounting and my
credit rating is
dr hall like a credit reading rule nope
didn't make it
all right so you try to figure out
uh dr hollister just starts to like hand
over
uh several hundred dollars a little
more than that
there's no more whoa whoa
give them half of that where's our
backup warehouse
no 100 100 is a nice round figure
for how many days over here has 300
in his hand and he's like he's he hasn't
pocketed it yet because you're having
this incredibly awkward conversation in
front of him
yeah sorry i'm sorry no i closed my
wallet and i'm putting it back in my
pocket this is absurd
like this man looks like he's under a
good amount of stress
i've actually noticed him a couple times
throughout the day like

where to do it in egypt do you know
where to do it in the pacific but you
know the in the uh
and the china sea but you don't really
want to go back there
i'm sure it's fine oh man
thomas is now saying there might be some
libris arcana dice in there as well
this is turning into a prize package
yeah i just got
a really sick pretty set from liebus
arcana this came in yesterday
um if it's not birds of paradise we
don't talk about it here
oh i'm terribly sorry let me show off
the birds of paradise that i have going
on here
those are the hey i'm using the same
ones those are pretty or you know
magpie ones that i have here oh those
are nice
this is the prototype that will never
ever ever leave my house because
they're one of a kind you'll never see
rachel gif did we we've been sending
birds of paradise out his birthday
presents to friends and gamers
oh cool they make a lovely gift i hope
they're all worse for them though
i actually i actually have two two sets
for friends of mine that i got into role
playing games and
when i see them again they will be
gifted nice i think our code might still
be working
on birds of paradise as well
chaotic
chaotic and you get like 15 off of
whatever you want
it's you can't beat it and i
guarantee
my guarantee to you is that birds of
paradise dice will kill at least one of
your players
can they use that as a marketing slogan
um
i'm sure i'm sure andrea's thought of
that i'm a little worried because rachel
told me
rachel like goes oh i have to take a
picture of you with some dice
and so i i i may be i feel like
that's yeah
yeah but ezra approved
these are i i will not use
i have those lovely metallic dice that i
enjoyed no
i'm the only things in my dice donut now
are birds of paradise
wow highest honor there and i'm actually
i'm actually not being sarcastic
because i remember how you were like
nope i have one set i will never get
another
and when he says dice donut it's not
like an old thing that people sit on
it's after hemorrhoids it's actually
like the equivalent of a dice bag
i actually don't even know where it is
anymore but it's more it's more like a
diced box but it looks like a frosted
donut
it's a wooden wooden carries it's
awesome
wow we are far afield so
um it is 10 o'clock at night you've just
let that poor translator go
uh and yeah what are what are your
plans
you got up kind of early you're you're
we should break into madame linz and
steal the jade statue
what if we did that and then immediately
went to egypt
ooh like from her house
right out of there if we know her
address
and we can plan properly
and adhere to a certain table
we could go in time it so okay
all right i don't know listen i'm
listening to you doctor you can keep
talking
we can just guarantee it won't happen i
mean it's
it's a noble ambition but the great
dane society
is not known for its punctuality or its
ability to
keep to a plan we could work on that
though
we plan really well we plan really well
that's mostly that that's mostly because
no one is privy to us
making the the plans they just see the
disastrous outcomes
oh we we've got some great outcomes guys
come on man it's not let's not
let's not put ourselves down here go on
where do we think madame would be right
now
maybe what what bar would she be at
emma you you you have the calendar uh
what what day of the week is it
it's it's the fifth right sixth sixth
it's like literally you told me this
five minutes ago so it's wednesday night
i'm assuming she'd be at one of those
clubs
that seems like a reasonable assumption
especially because it's only 10 o'clock
at night and we saw her go out
like dressed to the nines multiple times
when we were around her
i mean granted she is a gorilla now so i
don't know if she's well
i don't know you know probably is
because she's trying to take over as
like mayor of shanghai so
you know yeah out there to be seen
well we don't need the group of us all
going together to her house
that didn't make any sense
did we get any sense for how big this
thing is
yeah how big is it oh no i i've seen it
i would remember how big is this thing
it's about about two feet tall got
you big okay
and it's in her the place where we had
dinner that room
it's in the room with all the other
trinkets that she doesn't understand
i mean i know i know exactly where it is
if we could get in
and get out we could do it pretty
quickly she no longer has gorilla
bodyguards
that's true this is true because she is
a gorilla bodyguard
all right well this is it's a stealth
mission we sneak in we take it we get
out
well i think that means these two of us
take care
it seems it seems most reasonable for
donald and i to do this
yeah well all right well
might not be in the best condition
i'm i'm fine doctor i can hear this
oh that bandage around your neck says
otherwise
has it changed has he changed the
bandage at all today
it gets time i i'm gonna like gently
nudge
nudge donald with my with my shoulder
and say look the only way he's gonna let
you go is if you let him deal with with
uh that go on
and doctor take this thing off and let's
time to get the pus
out on the so
here's a positive there is no pus
because
you take the bandage off and it's like
nothing happened his neck
is exactly the same as it was
before you hacked three inches of of
skin
and back neck material off
there's no slice there's no cut the mark
is still there
all right so drain the puffs or whatever
it is you have to do put the bandage on
and
let me go do i see this because i i
would i would be looking i think
i'm sure yeah anybody who it's a
doctor there was a long like 10 second
well i don't think you need the bandage
anymore
all right all right that's great it's
here let's that's fine
let's let's let's get back to work donal
it's still there what do you mean
reaching back what it has a feel it
feels like your neck
there's no cut there's no
it doesn't hurt did it feel funny last
time he was
he was touching it yeah it hurt
no i i i i remember touching like like
like the market not feeling right
oh oh yeah no it has that same feel of
it's not your skin there's a very clear
like there's a very clear like weird
feeling of this is
not my skin and donald still has these
scars on his leg where they took the
skin off
for the transplant right oh yeah let's
have a look at that then
those hurt do my job yeah those hurt you
change the bandage on those those look
normal
all right doctor what the hell
happened
well my professional opinion
magic
[Laughter]
i'm gonna need to run some more where
did we get this one because he seems
real smart
[Laughter]
yeah we're we're keeping this one as
long as we can
what do you mean if they run some more
tests is that what is this different is
it different is it the same what does it
look like
oh it looks exactly the same what does
that mean
that means that whatever stanford did to
you
is not something that can be excised by
a blade
it's permanent or
i don't think i could remove much more
than i did last time
without very serious problems
for you there must be some other way to
get this often
um if it's magic right then there's some
other magic that
can remove it one would think but
i stay away from that stuff have to do
some research or something
oh god where's silvano when i need him
he's on an island
being tortured according to
the records right yeah i mean somebody
pull out his finger where's his thing
where's his finger pointing now
i'm not pulling that thing out he's got
the finger
i think i still do yeah no
you've got your finger i got my finger
yeah
was it what the good doctor not able to
reattach that or are we just going to
like chuck it in an incinerator at some
point
actually medical opinion would be great
is that reattachable or not
oh no not at this point that would be
weird it would always
point toward like you'd put it on and it
would just like
your hand will always be like towards
you so donald still has his own finger
in a little
little starbucks or a cigarette case
probably nice
how does that make you feel nope
get out
[Laughter]
right wow donald and i have a statue to
go steal
well what how
donald's had something of a shock
um and
i will point out dr hollister that the
entirety of the last
oh five months have been a shock
and prior to that about five years ago
there was a hell of a shock
so we sort of live in a state of
perpetual
shock this is a pretty minor shock all
so if we're if we're gonna try to not
operate under conditions of shock
we should just go throw ourselves in the
ocean right now because
it's over no but we throw ourselves into
our work that's what we do
so speaking of throwing ourselves in the
ocean so when madame lynn figures out
what we're up to
how are we getting out of this mess how
are we getting to the island how are we
getting out of here
how long after making a no like a phone
call doesn't take too long do we have a
phone in here
no it's not in the warehouse do we have
a location
that's relatively safe i think
i could leave get wired some more money
tomorrow when things are open
set up a location where we do have a
phone and if
afterwards you can arrive there only
if you have obtained the statue we could
then make a call
and exit immediately
we should we should probably at some
point also wire um
oh i've lost his name the the lawyer
yeah you're going to have to show me how
to do this wiring stuff since nobody
will go get my
what carlton ramsay thank god that's
carlton ramsay we we should start
nobody wants yeah since nobody wants to
there's there's there's kind of a lot of
nightmares between
us and silvano once we steal it from
madame lin we'll be just like
brady to her she will think of us as she
thought of him
i suspect she already does well if you
get caught
but it sounds like we should wait till
tomorrow when we're set up to actually
leave
which means donald should rest for the
night
fine another day shouldn't be too much
trouble
all right well i will i will i'll
look around here and see if i can make a
drum
because we need a skin and just you
know basically just something
that we could make a drum out of so uh
maybe even
we could probably also get we could
probably also get a drum at one of the
the markets
someone in shanghai would be happy to
sell you a drum or
or so or somewhere in egypt imagine or
someone else would also be happy to
start
there we should take a pot and a spoon
with us anyway
yes
eraser texas or tx like i would think
texas
he won the first giveaway and then
thomas immediately started another
giveaway so now we're giving away i
think a critical deck
a critical hit deck so last chance
for hashtag
chaos or no hashtag crit i guess this
one yes
crit in the chat last chance oh lucy
is attacking
uh lucy go so
uh so you're just gonna lay off for
tonight
sure we did we did wake up pretty early
i imagine both donald and dr hollister
are feeling the effects of being awake
for a long time
but don't we think that madam lin's out
of her house now that we should go
now and get the thing i think we're
assuming that she is
i think that's one of the reasons your
sorry you know you do have a point in
the fact that tomorrow evening
um you two could potentially stake out
her house wait till she leaves
that's a good point okay
it and it is it is fairly late and uh
you you donal and
uh dr hollister you look exhausted i'm
yes yeah all right
uh so it is yeah about
11 people start going to sleep
everything's fine everybody make me
listen roles everything's fine he says
before making us make lucid rolls
i enjoyed that so i look up and i see
three thumbs down
so two of you made it do we need to uh
listen to somebody else
no i think it's fine two of you made it
that's fine okay i'm sure it's great
uh so i mean you
well let me rephrase that would you like
to inspire anybody else
who has who has the best listen among
you three 86
well what do you mean you and i made it
just curious
he's got a great listen but he's yeah i
could really
need to i
i think we we 44 i i think we inspire
um tom let's just try one more yeah
let's try it again
it says famous last words of somebody
fumbles
[Music]
all right yes so everybody that made it
this was actually a smell test
at about two in the morning you smell
smoke oh crap oh no
i am not moving and and and just i just
like
bang my car on on the floor as hard as i
can the three of you make me
constitution rolls
oh
yes yes again i need it 23.
all right so donald you are coughing uh
the the warehouse is already full of
smoke it is clear
that the warehouse is on fire
[Music]
i didn't start dare i say
the roof the roof the roof is on fire
nice i have a story about that it's just
it's not a character but like we were at
a bar in mexico
and literally the bar was on fire so all
of us go outside
except my boss who's on the balcony and
we're screaming the roof the roof's on
fire and he's like what we're like no
the roof's on fire he's like what
nice anyway uh
well yeah wake up then i i guess right
so
yeah i i i would slam my caught a caught
on the floor as hard as i can to
make a lot of noise and wake people up
monster
grabbing as many grenades as i can
so are you leaving the warehouse
what are you doing
i'm grabbing paperwork i'm grabbing all
the paperwork i have it in my bag
all right we're gonna you know what
let's go to initiatives here no no
for no reason at all no uh
all right so donald will grab his bag
and then see if hollister's up
uh hollister is not up and then he'll
he'll
rouse him very very brusquely all right
you you dump his cod over you are now
awake hollister next round you and joan
can both do something
uh 80s 70s alexandra um
i i'm i'm going to get up and like you
were banging and making noise
yeah but that but that was before
initiative so i'm going to get up and
seeing that the people are starting to
move like grab my stuff
and start gathering it okay emma what
are you doing
grenades door are you throwing a grenade
at the door
no i'm taking all my grenades with me
and
all my other stuff you're leaving
everything else you're just grabbing the
grenades
i don't really have anything left since
everything's been blown up or
melted or like you know that means
yeah i have nothing except a bag full of
grenades and a bicycle now pretty much
literally the clothes on her back are
mine yeah wait
there's a satchel with all the receipts
in it and all the
that's with the that's with jones stuff
all right that's okay because joan keeps
still bono stuff
okay there you go that's all so long so
yeah it's just my bigger grenade
so you start to roll a bike out the door
uh uh
all right that's
one donal yeah what are you doing
after making two holsters up and he's
got his bag he's gonna start
moving towards an area where there's
there's no smoke which i'm assuming
so you you packed pretty you know you
were you were mostly packed so
you get your stuff up together and you
start looking
right now it look looks like the smoke
is
i mean it's hard to tell where there is
and isn't smoke
um so yeah all right alexandra 70s
so i know that that smoke tends to
intends to be heavier and like be down
low
um once i've gathered all
of my stuff isn't it stop drop and roll
you're supposed to get down
yeah yeah supposed to be stop
when you're on fire yeah but they tell
you like the bugs bunny cartoon told you
when there's fire
get down yeah you get down on the ground
smoke actually goes up
yeah smoke goes up i yeah you think he's
fog
smoke goes you're thinking i'm tired
it's been a really and you put your low
beams on
okay so if it's a dog you put your low
beams on oh alexander is like
putting her head up into smoke and wait
that's not right now
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna make my my way
toward the door
now that i've gathered my stuff and i i
have a dagger in hand because
you i have done this sort of thing often
enough that if i were
someone setting a roof on fire i would
have a sniper outside the door
ready to shoot the first person to come
through
you're going to parry it with a knife no
i'm not going to open the door
i'm i'm just i'm just moving over with
caution and getting and getting ready to
handle whatever's out there because
there's only one door right 60s
60s i've got the paperwork in the
satchel
and my crowbar oh okay so joan this
round you will go to the table and you
just like
shove everything in there and grab your
crowbar good to go
uh 50s emma i have a surprise for you
but don't think you are any longer the
lowest initiative in the group
what i'm 40 oh yeah the new guy is not
fleet of foot
so emma what are you doing are you going
going out the door
yeah i'm riding my bike out the door all
right ring the bell
riding your bike out the door um
wow so as you ride out the door
i'm probably not fast enough to grab her
a shot rings out
and like goes about through the roof
of the of the place there's like a bang
and just they miss you
terribly i just wheel around i'm like
sniper on the roof as i like circle on
nice all right dr hollister you are
awake now
yeah i'm grabbing my stuff and i'm
actually going towards the dock exit and
i'm gonna try and just
drop it in the water as soon as i get
there so if they can't see who i am
okay yeah that'll that'll work you you
head the other direction from everybody
else
uh all right that is two
uh i see everyone else is going the
other way
they're all heading towards the front
door i'm not heading anywhere yet
so where are you going well all right
and you yell where are you going
he heard the shot so he's gonna go to
the door
crouching as low as he can and peek
outside just a tiny bit to see if you
can see any any shooter
all right so you're going to be blocking
the door for everybody else could be
using the door door for his cover yeah
you know
a little bit as low as he can and just
just enough so we can see what's out
there
um so it is dark outside you don't see
any sniper you see you see emma
all right and as he stays really low
can he can he breathe now or
is it still smoking yeah you can you're
you're uh
you're starting to you're starting to
get air in your lungs and cough less
and then he's gonna lay on the ground
and he'll start opening his bag up and
start working on a rifle
okay that's what you'll do this round
sure 70s alexandra donald is
donald is pretty much blocking the door
especially now that he is assembling his
rifle
um there's not a hell of a lot that i
can do i'm gonna look up and see if i if
i can start seeing
flames through the roof
sure yeah it looks like it looks like
there is smoke
coming from like almost all the way down
the roof it looks like the roof
uh has been pretty well emulated i say
trying to avoid any
pop donald i don't think we have a lot
of time
that that roof's about to come down all
right there's a sniper out there
i'm aware i heard them there's one other
exit to try the other exit perhaps i'll
stay here for just a moment
joan make me a spot hidden roll that
goes in water
since you're you're next on a 60s i just
got it just
got it so as you're shoving the papers
in there
you see like a a the the translator left
a note
and it says it says uh
um in in english it says
you're all idiots i hope you die
translate a rat at us and i i'm also
gonna i'm gonna go back uh
follow dr hollister back all right so
you're heading the back way all right
uh and i yell i yell out that he ratted
us
i mean i paid every guy every ch every
reason
it's true emma are you gonna
just so well yeah i'm i want to ride out
of here but where do i
where do i see or hear where do i think
this guy is
make a spot hidden come on baby
it's one of your skills man that would
be it
this is a 20 out of 86 so i suspect
that's gonna be at least a hard
very good yeah in fact it's one point
away from extreme
knife would you like to spend a point of
luck to make it extreme
no you know i'll take i'll take the mine
is not extreme because i'm on a bike
all right yeah you so with a hard
success
there is clearly on uh
uh this this sort of row of warehouses
uh and then right in front of it is a
hill
and that sniper is on that hill so he's
um
he's up there it seems like he's
about even with this warehouse
how far away is it the hill is a pretty
good hill
and on this side it's fairly sheer it's
kind of like a bluff around the other
side
it's not like he's across the street no
he's far he's farther than across the
street
okay so he's like maybe a pistol might
would probably he probably is not
shooting a pistol
okay so he's got to be closer to a mile
it's not something that i can close the
distance between it
okay so then i'm not seeing anybody come
out so
i'm gonna i don't want to go parallel to
this so i'm gonna go
around the warehouse and kind of next to
the warehouse so i don't get shot
okay make me a luck roll
i don't even know where that is on my
oh beautiful beautiful uh
yeah it's then it's not like there's
confusion it's these are well marked
dice
it's not like my cheater dice where i'm
like it could be 99 or it could be 09 i
can't tell
all right so nope 99. i was asking you
to make that roll to see if there was a
path
all the way around the warehouse or if
it was like just on the sides
so it's just on the sides and
as you as you start to bite down
um you see on the roof
you could swear you see a gorilla just
like smashing down
on the roof of the warehouse the one
that's our warehouse that's on fire one
all right dr hollister can i get out
to the
dock area so you make it to the back and
so the dot
this dock there's not really a
door so much as it just descends
into the water so you can like
jump into the water because boats come
directly into the warehouse
so you can jump into the water and like
i i want to look really quickly and see
if anyone looks like they're heading my
way
you see joan coming your way with a bag
right then i'm gonna i'm gonna wait
uh back to donal so your rifle is you're
very good at putting your rifle together
it is together now
he will lean out just as much as he has
to he's like prone on the ground on the
floor
i guess put the scope out there and you
start to search for the shooter
make me a spot hidden roll
so that's a 60. which is a regular
success
okay you do not have a beat on this yet
uh alexandra i'm not going out
out the waterway phobias are fun
and i'm not tempting those dice so
seeing
donald go going prone i'm i'm i'm gonna
um
glance at glance up at the roof and
then like
juke around him basically and uh
go in the direction i saw emma going
uh 34 which is a hard success
all right yeah you do not you do not
disturb donald at all you very
you very dexterously slide out um
as you slide out a shot rings out
oh i'm going to give you a bo since
you got a hard cess i'm going to give
you a bonus die on this dodge roll
okay
you're gonna need it that is a
i had a hard success so you just
barely like there is a crack and you
like hear the whiz of a bullet near one
of your ears
um and yeah donald you get a sense that
there's
somebody up on that hill okay muzzle
flash
you didn't see one this time it was uh
but but now that you know
kind of where you're looking you figure
the next time you'll get a good sense
okay you can start taking shots all
right um
joan all right i'm gonna uh
is there any not water back here or does
it just go into the water
there's on the side there's a yeah
there's a little area
like where on the side where you could
unload load and unload the boat
okay because i don't want to go in the
water with all the papers unless i have
to
yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
come out and and
and jump down so there's not an exit
the only exit from this end is through
the water
because this way boats go we can okay if
it's like going along the edge of a
swimming pool if we're careful we can go
along and keep our bags
above it yeah inch away and then all
right
yes yes that's why i was wondering if
there was any any no there's no
connection
to the thanks to emma's luck role
there's not
an outside railed pathway all the
way around
okay so yeah but we're gonna hold on
to the building basically and and
keep the everything up carefully so
you essentially almost walk down our
boat ramp
into the water on your sides there
are
the dock where they can unload stuff so
you walk down and once you're in the
water yeah you can
basically like you're you're you're sort
of going from piling to piling
because you're now like seeing the the
stakes that hold the the
uh the logs that hold this warehouse up
and you're kind of going
uh that was 60s emma
um so i get to the back of the building
hopefully
yes do i see anybody coming out
and and and the birds of paradise give
it back
um so that is an extreme success because
that's a 10.
yes you see you see joan like
just coming around way down in the
water it's about
um at the very back here it's about 15
feet
down to the water okay and she is
coming around
uh holding a bag above her like um
inching along the the side of the
building
okay so as quietly as i can in all this
commotion
um i'm gonna put the bike down get down
like get on my belly towards joan and
reach for and just be like
so like you're not going to reach her
okay
but i still want her to be quiet all
right yeah joan you you see
you see emma's head poke over and emma's
uh
uh she makes the international symbol
which is this we all know it's this dab
and a half
uh dr hollister i'm yeah i'm following
joan and i'm i'm whispering
to her like do we have a meetup plan for
this
after we all get separated what's the
plan you guys have
backup warehouse we didn't get what he
gives us so much credit
for actually thinking through things and
he's going to be sorely disappointed
over the next weeks
all right that's four make me a group
luck roll
how's this so does does luck have the
hard and critical applied to it yeah
yeah
all right so it's the same as your pal
right so you can use your pal one
oh no it's not the same as your pal
sorry yeah i was gonna say i've lost a
lot then obviously if it works
now yes hard all right so that'll count
as two so everything's fine
uh donal i will
so everybody in the building you're
hearing like
does he have an idea where this other
sniper might be
uh so you know he's on the hill but they
haven't fired again yet so now you're
like watching the hill very carefully
so when they fire again you'll see him
dueling snipers going on here so he's
gonna be
with a burning building above you be
patient and wait for one more shot
okay alexandra i'm i'm gonna keep
trying trying to meet up with emma i saw
what direction she went and i'm gonna go
in the same direction sure yeah you make
it around the side of the building you
see emma lying on her stomach like
looking over the very back of the end
you will get up to her this round
uh joan i'm gonna keep so there's not
a ladder to climb up you're going to
have to basically go around this
uh until it gets to like where the
street is and then there'll be a way up
yep yep so that's how i'm just going to
keep going i'm going to keep going
just let them know i'm going that way
it's going but you guys are both making
it
uh emma are you going to do anything
else you're going to stay here
no i'm going to actually be like if
they're going that way i'll be like yes
go that way and then
make sure that she can't see me and then
just kind of slink that way leave the
bike and just go that way
all right okay no
wait would it would i have seen the uh
the gorilla on the roof as well when i
caught up with emma
the gorilla you see it now
because crashing down
onto the path next to emma
is a crazed
like singed smoking madame lynn
and she looks at you and she says
i give you one chance you come with me
now
and stay with me forever or i'm going to
too late and she starts to reach for you
and will well actually wait she's got a
very high initiative so we'll deal with
that but
okay your non-answer is an answer uh
uh and hollish is doing that all right
on 150 madame lin will get her hands on
emma
oh my you should make a fight brawl
roll
i cannot stress enough that you should
make this
um i don't can i inspire myself
yes yes yes i just want to also see what
it is oh i've done better so
oops let me put that in the bucket i
smell it i smell an emma coming
i smell it imma please oh
okay so my fight brawl is a 41 and i got
a 21. i don't know if that's half
because my math is terrible
it's not quite half no it's yeah so
it's definitely
it's it's a well into the uh
sadly madame lin got a critical success
that's fine
so well knock's not gonna madam lin
uh is going to hurl you into the ocean
oh okay that's all right so madame
grabs you and just chucks you as hard as
she can
eat into the ocean uh
and it turns out that with her strength
she can throw you fairly
fairly far make me a dex roll
okay also terrible at that if i make
this though i want to get into like a
swimmer's dive position
yeah that would be a swim roll two
oh yes she she
throws you and somehow you who like
spin it around and you enter the water
just perfectly there's like no splash
the east germ even the east german judge
did you a nine
it is outstanding and you take no
damage with that role that's amazing
you are you are now severed
you are now several swim rolls away from
i was about to say do those two just see
yeah like dr hollister and joan you see
like you hear
some weird kind of roar and then you see
emma just go
flying into the water uh
and she just and all of a sudden she
just magically
you're not sure emma's not a mermaid at
uh wow okay that was unexpected
uh so
uh donald you and this sniper are
playing the sniper doesn't have a clean
shot at anyone so you think the sniper's
waiting to get a clean shot at somebody
he's donald's gonna delay his action
until that guy fires and he's gonna
return fire
at the spot where he saw the muzzle
flash so you
you are a train you this is your thing
so you
know you figure if this guy knows what
you know he's waiting for someone to
come out the door
and so if as long as donald can keep
looking
make me an intelligence role see
yeah that's a regular success all right
the
this is a big disadvantage to your
you figure at a s at some point you
don't know when
that roof is coming down all right
he doesn't know when but he knows if
he runs out he's getting shot so
he's he'll give it just a little bit
longer until his instincts tell him
here's maybe he hears something fall
behind him he'll just he'll scurry out
okay if okay because with that
if the roof does fall you'll get a bonus
die to avoid
uh the roof with that all right uh
alexandra there is an enraged uh
female gorilla with its back to you that
just
threw emma a very long way
thank you so much um
so with her back to me i mean she's very
focused on emma i want to see if i can
find somewhere that i can just hide
because i don't want to cross
metaphorical blades with
with a gorilla when i am tired smokes
and smoke singed and
uh kind of at a disadvantage in all of
this and also i don't want to actually
kill her because i don't want to be
gorilla alexandria thank you very much
uh it would become an opera gorilla
yeah i would do amazing things to your
voice
uh so so you're gonna like back away
and
try and try and hide yeah i'm going to
try to find
just like somewhat something somewhere
to like duck and end cover
all right make me a stealth roll with a
bonus die because uh
enraged madame lynn is not really so
focused on you
uh 26 not not quite a hard success but
close
sure yeah you are so you're like you're
like kneeling down behind
those big metal things they tie boats to
you know
like found one of those that you're sort
of crouching behind and yeah and
and i do have a dagger out and like laid
with with the flat against my legs so
so that the the moon or any any leather
light doesn't catch it and give any give
it away to anyone
i consider you having a dagger out
implicit uh
i i have had people who have been like
well you didn't draw it so i
i try to make it explicit what what i
think should be implicit
those are those are people that are
running other games uh
joan pathfinder yes
yes yeah no joan
yes i
flying emma but i can't do anything for
that right now i need to get out of this
water
so i i am i'm gonna just try to go as
fast as i can to to get out of this
water all right make me uh
i would accept either a let's call it a
strength roll make me a strength roll
okay
48 out of 55 so i just all right
so you are you are you are one step
closer
to being out of this uh
emma role
um that would i'm like let me guess
that's under s
yeah what is that 30 is like the 20 is
the i think
20. 20 is the base yeah
that's what's 80 and 10. i don't
understand birds in paradise so like the
10 is a zero
okay so it's 80. i'm just wondering
do i
do i do i mean yeah you want to you want
to be able to swim
so i i say do it if we got the
inspiration don't die yeah
swim by the way i just want to make
clear to anybody who's buying birds of
paradise
that 10 0 thing is only on the
prototypes
it is not on the the ones that you're
gonna buy my dice
do not have i'll just show you that my
die
has a zero on it not a ten that was
just a factory error on the prototypes
i pulled a nick it's it's an 80 again
it's the same thing
i'm glad that that has entered the
common parliament
exactly the same thing after using
inspiration
literally so you get no closer
to the thing but you are not drowning so
that's a bonus okay
and my direction if i was gonna get
closer would be
like i'm gonna triangulate towards where
joan is going not back but
that way so if it's longer it doesn't
matter okay sure
uh dr hollister yeah i am
i'm i'm more trying to not splash and
draw the attention of the thing that i
heard roar above me
with the the emma flying sure yeah
that's
that's a great move make me a strength
roll
that would be a critical success oh man
so yeah you
you are you are sliding through the
water with ease
all the adrenaline yeah that's right
that's right
welcome to your first field operation
all right
that is five everybody make me luck
rolls
oh i see one success two successes
a 97 is not in anything is it oh that's
a fumble my dear
that yeah he's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all down
i got a nine i got a 96. oh double
fumbles this roof is coming down
i'm sorry donald
you get a dex roll with advantage
to not take a lot of damage
only take some damage don't go slow out
that door
go fast 25's a hard success for him on
dexterity
oh nice all right hard success so
um you take six points of damage but
you are not
pinned or anything like that you you are
out of the building
and on the plus side
it seems like the falling the caving in
of the roof
apparently surprised the sniper and they
did not
immediately fire at you on the minus
side you're now wonderfully backlit
as this warehouse is going up
all the debris coming down would have
pushed the smoke
right yeah right now you've got a little
cover
unfortunately this warehouse is full of
and explain explosives yes an odd
firework or two
starts to go off oh no
um and so this fire is now raging
what was his damage six
we haven't heard any fire engines or
fire things or anything coming
not in your experience the fire
brigade in shanghai
is questionable at best
true true and i'm betting madam lin told
them to hold back
and i'm betting that a insane gorilla
it's very persuasive there just my guess
is
i'm just wondering just wondering
so yeah donald you have jumped out of
the building that is your action for
this round
uh to get out of there alexandra
oh madam sorry on 150 madame lynn
um you hear madame lynn mutter under her
breath
i would have given you everything
and she leaps back up to the top of the
building
okay and it seems like you see this kind
of tight rope walk going on the side of
the building
but not as shaky as that this is just
you know this is like super easy for her
and she is heading towards the front of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
[Music]
okay
okay seeing that i'm going to
keep low and and keep as much cover as
as i can get while not being like right
up against the burning
uh warehouse but i haven't seen donald
come back yet
so i'm i'm i'm going to make my slow
careful
stealthy way up up toward the front
to be like
get out of there all right slow and
careful is gonna take you two rounds
okay get to the front you came around in
a faster manner the first time
so this will be two rounds all right uh
joan
oh zero four all right with that roll
you have made it to the ladder so you
start you're gonna start climbing up
and yeah when i get to the top i'm gonna
wait for hollister okay
uh i saw him swim roll
all right oh
nine nice so yeah you start to swim
towards the ladder that joan was
on
where were you nick when i was building
this character i would have liked to
have known that
didn't come up in the train game at all
yeah that's just don't go anywhere near
explosives
emma emma has wet explosives
what that's that means they just don't
go off in emma's brain
uh hollister make me a strength roll you
need one more strength roll to get up
come on holly oh we're gonna call him
that now
oh yeah that's that's a hard success
all right yeah so you
both you and joan are at the ladder uh
you will be
[Music]
all right donald make me
i just like to say that ezra is a bad
bad man he is
yes amy was already holding up them yep
you can feel a thousand pound gorilla
jumping down on you
yeah it's a 94 which is worse that's
not quite an emma that's what happens
amy not emma all right so a thousand
pound gorilla comes crunching down
on you from from above
you take seven points of damage
crunch and
uh so you got you like get pushed
down on the ground madame lynn grabs
your head
he me have an answer to that she's emma
yeah
oh i i think i i think he's a major
wound for him right
uh yes are you at zero oh yeah
oh
79 on my con is not a success
pirate what inspire that try it again
49 success all right so you
briefly as she crunches down on you like
your vision
swims and you feel yourself losing
consciousness
and you pull through and you stay
conscious
uh and it's your initiative i think he's
going to
stay limp all right but he's had in one
hand he's got that rifle
probably has probably slid away from him
at this point yeah
one wonders duffel bag but he's gonna
lay limp just
wait this out he's dead yeah okay
no problem alexandra uh
you you sneak forward again next
round you will be around the corner and
see an unfortunate site
yeah joan you're up you
uh if you you can be up the ladder this
round okay
that's that's right you you climb up the
ladder um
you look over to your left and you see a
large
gorilla and there might be somebody
under
uh that gorilla and you see a
massive fire where that where that
building was
um okay i'm going to i'm getting you're
getting up this round
yeah you cut up the ladder and you've
got enough room that hollister can get
up as well okay good good that's all
going to say i want to try to make him
get up
um 24 close but no cigar still can't
believe you made that dex roll
wow that was that was a thing of beauty
outstanding so yeah you you don't
make a lot of progress
uh uh
and hollister you make it up the
ladder
um this is your first time seeing there
is a gorilla there
now you've heard stories about gorillas
but this is the first time so um
i'm gonna ask you do you think you need
to make uh
a sand roll or is it gonna be when the
i mean i'm pretty much ready for that
but i
also am not i'm more focused on moving
away from it
if i hear it i'm not like what's that
it's like i know what that is
and i'm getting away i've heard stories
okay then yeah that's fine i will not
madame lynn is not a smart woman yeah
all right so
uh on a on a 150
madame lynn snarls
away
and you you see you know climbing
up the the wood up the trees up the hill
just
super rapidly very quickly
uh and that was 150 for to you donal how
close is he to some kind of cover
uh you can you could maybe like
crawl around the corner of the of the
uh of the the warehouse
another warehouse or the burning one oh
no the burning one
i don't think it's somewhere that's not
there's not a lot around you that isn't
on fire right now there are some boxes
crates dumpsters all of that is on fire
this is a
an empty street and in front and then
the the bluff up you could like try and
get closer to the edge of the bluff
hoping that like the guy
doesn't like to shoot like that how far
um at the rate you're moving you could
probably get there
okay so he he's just gonna steal himself
as much as he can and not just
let the adrenaline take over this is a
deep breath
grab his rifle with one hand the back of
the other and then just
run forward as fast as he can towards
that bluff to try to find a safe place
to hide
all right i'm going to make you an offer
if you
go without getting your stuff you can
make it to the bluff no roll needed
if you're going to take the time to get
your stuff there's going to be some
rolling involved
i'll take the rolling okay so
make me well actually you know what this
will just be make me a dodge roll this
guy's just going to shoot
that way do i have i have gm inspiration
right
yeah you still got some i would like to
use one roll out man you're completely
oh much better all right
on the dodge yeah regular between
all right that that works i got a
regular success as well so um
you the the shot is very close to you
but you are now at the edge of the blood
at the
the base of the bluff and from your sort
of triangulation of how he's shooting
it seems like it would be a very
difficult shot for him
to try and get you okay alexandra
you come around the corner and you see
uh you see donald like run pell mel
as hard as he can and fling himself to
as you come around the corner up to your
right
you see hollister and joan both coming
okay or they're up the ladder sorry i
should say they're up the ladder yeah
um it appears the sniper
was and you see yeah you see like a
shot hit the ground
behind donal with all of the light that
the the burning building is providing
can i get a beat on this person
um if he fires again probably
okay but right now you're like he's
somewhere up there but you don't know
where
but i can't make out like a form or a
figure or anything he's pretty high
above everything
okay i'm
going going to go to hollister and and
joan because it's like
i don't know what donald's doing but if
i go in that direction i'm going to get
shot at i think
hi baby you get a laser pointer in truth
[Laughter]
he heard you say laser pointer man lucy
is
so we took lucy three days ago
to the vet to get and you know the vet's
like
for you know for a couple days keep an
eye out the cone was off in five minutes
like we already left lucy alone in the
room and like the cone was gone
and let's just say lucy's a fast
healer apparently
or an idiot one of the two one of the
combination of the both
cats are so bad about showing pain too
it's really frustrating
um yeah i i'm i'm going to run
i'm going to run to donal to try and
help back him up
all right guys already shot this turn
so he can't shoot again so
you start heading towards uh
you start you run towards him you'll
make it this round he is in bad
shape i don't know what the hell
um was it is that my entire action or
can i try to do first date
is your entire action okay you know what
i'll make you an offer
that you can get to him that's your
entire action or
you can slow down enough that this guy
can get a shot at you but you will get
i'll slow down okay
uh i'm going to use a gm inspiration on
that
keep going this is cool
oh yeah but it wasn't better enough um
but yeah there's a shot at you but you
get to donald so make a first aid roll
neat like let like keep up next to him
and just be like you
oh god somebody put your thumb in the
hole
uh that is a 24 out of 55. that is a
hard success
success so you get three points back
you're welcome dear and alexandra is
you're both up against the edge of the
bluff
and you sort of realized the same
thing that donald did
that you know it's going to be a very
hard shot to get you guys
uh all right joan all right um
no he's a long way away that's a
thousand yards out in the dark so okay
you're back there somewhere you have no
idea where we have no idea where
okay then then my second question is how
do i think that the guy has a shot at us
i mean he seems like he was distracted
by donald
trump all right so i would we need to
hide i'm going to tell hofstra dude we
need to hide so this so this uh
this guy can't get to us and then we'll
have to try to see if we can get
i know that yeah okay all right
so you can find similarly you can find
the one of those
you know big things they tie boats to
uh that you could both hide around so if
they do try and shoot you they will
definitely have a penalty die
perfect we'll do that for now and then
see what happens okay
nope but close what is that that's a 25
class but no
so as you're you're you're slowly like
the tide is doing more than you are to
get you
you know the the the the waves are doing
more to get you back in there but you're
slowly
making your way in and you're you're not
drowning so that's you know a bonus
and also you're not on fire or have an
angry gorilla yep this is true
i in some respects if i had something to
float on that'd be probably the best of
all options at this point
uh hollister you are gonna i guess join
joan behind the
uh if she happens to be finding cover
further away and then finding additional
cover further away and then
finding additional cover further away
and so on then yes i will be
but if she's finding cover nearby i'm
getting distance
and i'm not turning around so they can
see my face all right
so she has found cover nearby she
went for the first cover so you're
covered just keep running towards the
farther okay so you
you're running away from the sniper
towards other cover
make me a luck roll
uh
[Music]
regular success song okay yeah so you
will
this round you're running full out and
you'll make it to one of the to
the farther one of those
boat hook things that i should if i knew
what the name was i'd say it but i don't
um i like it a boat post
i see i see holly just go right past me
right yeah yeah okay
break the cover that away he zooms down
um all right uh
on a 150 something happens all right
um and sniper fly towards the water
why won't you love me
i don't like that i don't know in
chinese
i kind of like that oh but he's been
sort of useful
i think if he were not as used not that
useful he would he hasn't shot any of us
yet
he's out with his usefulness
thing is she's crazy enough to do it
that's the problem oh yeah
no she is and then what does she do
though
just storm home fine
turn it turn on really sad music
and make a mixtape
[Music]
uh yeah so on on 150 something happens
uh donald
so you can kind of inch your way along
the base of the bluff
um the direction that you saw hollister
go
um and and you feel like you know you're
still going to have a good defensive
position
alexandra we have to click them out
all right we'll let's do the usual i
i'll draw his fire
got it it will circle around i so um
be careful but before he does this
stretch out make sure the bleeding is
stopped i'll put the rifle away
i'll go with a couple of handguns
something i can use a lot of ammunition
basically
okay the idea is more so than to uh
cover fire as opposed to
right all right it's gonna kind of blind
fire up there
and when she's ready and donald feels
like he's ready he'll get
positioned
you're running away from everybody else
yeah away from the shooter and away from
this position
but wait are you running towards
hollister or away from hollister
because so the bluff basically here's
the here's the warehouse the bluff
is like this so the warehouse is kind of
at the point of the bluff
you can go hollister and and joan are
going to the right
um and so are you going to go that way
or the other way
i'll go the other way i don't want to
drop i don't want them getting caught in
this fire
okay all right other way he'll try to
stay in cover but he'll keep she'll
he'll draw the attention of
the sniper you know fire several rounds
back in it and just to keep it
distracted keep him distracted
until he runs another camera position
ducks down and
lets alexandra begin to move on her i'm
going to make you an offer
you can stay on the side of the bluff
he won't be able to shoot you but your
shots will have no chance of hitting him
but you'll you'll draw his attention uh
or you can put yourself in danger but
have a chance of hitting him
option a okay yeah so you
run along the base and you're basically
just firing almost straight up
okay and not not 100 straight up
because you're not a dumb person
but yeah you know you're just sort of
blindly firing into the bluff
and yeah sure enough well let's make an
intel yeah sure enough
uh a shot like comes down close to you
but not
really you know nowhere that's in danger
to you but he's
he's paying attention to you alexandra i
would have been watching
with because donald and i have done this
before um
i i would have been watching to try and
get a bead on on where that shot from
the
uh sniper comes from yeah you have a you
have a pretty good idea
okay i want to be able to get to him
what do i need to do
to to get to him wow you need to be a
gorilla
like that would really help so you
can start climbing up the bluff
okay okay make me a climb roll
okay i put points in this back at the
beginning and i've never used it
now's the chance oh it's the time neat
19. 19. all right so yeah you start you
start climbing up the bluff
it is it is slow going between the
the the the angle and the trees and
stuff but yeah you are making your way
up
so much easier if you're a gorilla
though well you know what
madame lynn made it up in one round i
mean that the the
the climbing would be easier but many
other things would be so much harder
so you know i don't know i think it's
worth it you should kill a gorilla
i do not agree with you at all
[Laughter]
all right you're so into it kill the
gorilla yeah no
um all right so i wow i'm trying to
figure out whether i should go
running after holly or i should uh
see if i can come back there's
nothing i really can do there's not much
that a uh
a crowbar and some paperwork is going to
be able to do
buddy holly if you my buddy
my buddy holly yes that's also a strong
yes see that's why we work well together
i got the holly you got the buddy
it's perfect that's wonderful all
right so
on that note yes i'm going to go
i'm going to go we're going to we're
going to go meet up we're going to meet
up and i'm going to try to persuade him
to
circle around back so we can get to our
friends
all right you yeah you make it up to his
to that that the
the the one that he is at yeah uh
seven oh nice yeah you are you are
you have a burst of swimming and you
are fairly close to making it back in
uh hollister you're going to continue
sorry yeah yeah i'm going to keep
trying to get further
and i'm i'm looking for a building that
i can like get alongside of the
obstructs so really your best bet is to
get around the curve of the bluff
because the buildings are all on the out
it's like pier 39 in the city
where all of the all of the buildings
are
on the water and then there's just a
hill up
or like it's more like where coit tower
is i assume i guess
the thing is you know what if nothing
else if i can move to where it's darker
and still take advantage of cover i
don't think he's going to see me so yeah
you
kidding you think you know you think you
know going the direction you're going
you will very quickly be out of his
sight
i like that that sounds delightful all
right yeah
so he runs away from me as soon as i
catch up to him is what you're saying
yeah yeah this is what's been happening
you know
you keep running up to one cover
hollister then runs to the next one
well i'm assuming things are somewhat
synchronous
like it's you know i'm pretty sure we
can get some
some words across she's trying to be
like oh yeah like let's do a
wider arc yeah okay all right
uh all right that was uh
that was joan i was hollister so uh
there we go
okay wow
hey
a lot easier to do that here than in the
studio and soon i have to like go
somewhere who knows where it went
uh are you gonna do this donald
are you gonna do the same thing of just
firing wildly
but he's gonna try to just draw the
attention of the sniper keep it focused
on on donald
fire shots in his direction so he's
distracted and
got his attention to keep him from
seeing alexandra climbing after him
this sniper is not a smart man
apparently so he's gonna just
say he has no you have no chance of
hitting him he has no chance of hitting
you
uh blam blam blam lots of gunshots
uh all right that was that uh
alexandra i am still climbing it's climb
roll
uh are you trying to do this quietly um
i'm i'm trying i'm trying to not yes but
i'm not like being super stealthy
because there's a roaring building and
gunshots going on so i feel relatively
safe making some noises
i'm gonna make you an offer you can
um you can do a stealth roll and a climb
roll
to have no chance for this guy to know
that you're coming
okay or you can take a penalty die on
the climb roll
and have no chance to know that he's
coming or uh
one of the two okay i will
yeah i'll i'll make that stealth jack
okay so
first to stealth checked in a climb roll
uh yeah 19 is a hard success for stealth
you are the knight i am the knight no
and klein is 21 so yes
all right yeah you are very you are very
close to where you heard that gunshot go
um it seems like so you're just about uh
uh you figure you're one turn away from
the crest
of the of the bluff and you figure he's
on the crest of the bluff
okay so see like working through it in
my mind i could get up high enough to
see him and and um
get up and stab theoretically
probably okay yeah
almost assuredly all right that was
okay i i we had our brief chat with mr
with and i'm going to doctor and i'm
going to go around the
the with so you guys are going around
the block yep we're going around the
bluff
all right that'll take care of both of
yep
no it's like a 69 or something like that
yeah all right so you might
progress this round uh
i'm really just waiting for the fumble
so i can start drowning use it i can use
the drowning rules
there are of course there's drowning
rules oh yeah of course
uh i've done it right yeah joan uh
joan got to enjoy them once before yes
uh
right okay uh
so you know i think at this point i'm
gonna take us out of initiative
alexandra you will you will slaughter
this poor man
as you sneak up on him he's
paying attention you stab him in the
back
uh no i i would absolutely grab him pull
his head up and just do a quick throw
cut to get it over with
yep so he is gone you guys make it
around the bluff emma finally makes it
to the ladder
um waiting for you at the ladder is a
very beat up donal
you will all find your way in the
embers
as the as though as your warehouse
finally collapses
uh from from the fire you make your
way off
into the shanghai night i i would like
to say that
that i kept the sniper's rifle sure you
have a sniper rifle
sure i have no idea what i'll do with it
but it's good news it's a trophy
um so it's about four o'clock in the
morning
it's 3 30 that's an even worse hour
somehow 3 30 is worse than four
uh before you're like it's almost
morning uh
it's 3 30 and you are wandering the
streets of shanghai
with what few belongings you have left
most of which involve weapons
i wouldn't and several of you are very
wet and cold
actually wait it's summer you're very
you're wet and comfortable
everyone else gets sweaty yeah we need
another hotel
it's me no what do you mean no
no that's we're gonna get something like
a large moving truck we're gonna get you
in the back of it
that way we can stay mobile and we're
not in one spot and it's harder to track
us
great how are you gonna buy a truck well
i'm gonna
first thing i'm gonna do is go wire some
more money
then i'm gonna rent one so yeah you can
easily
uh wire for money but you have to go
uh you have to go to a bank to do
that
um and i'm to need distance from all of
you to do that
and we're going to have to meet
somewhere discreet
so that i'm not easily spotted with you
and associated
the the international area is
probably the best and
out here outside of the international
area we are very white and stand out
in the international area at least
there's there's other white people
can we find an area that looks like
it'll be quiet where maybe there's some
sort of abandoned
building that we could break into then i
can pull the back of the truck up load
them in
a lot of these warehouses seem pretty
empty
let's let's let's pick one at random
yeah i was like let's squat
uh sure yeah you find an empty warehouse
um that you are able to break into
and so you guys are just gonna squat
here
yeah i'm gonna get some sleep until
hollywood gets back yeah
i mean aren't there sleep anywhere emma
just like
like as soon as you're in the building
emma just curls up and she's out
are there clothes or anything also in
any of these
so this is an abandoned warehouse so
there's no
medicine will take time right so i it
wouldn't make sense to work
on donald now i'll get the truck
medicine
and psychotherapy both take time first
aid is
immediate i'll be fine doctor i'll be
fine just get that truck for us and then
later on
you can take care of these my ribs
i'll i'll keep an eye on him all right
so hollister's going out by himself
so the first thing that happens is you
you basically are you gonna go out
before morning
uh i'm gonna try and wring out my
clothes
first there's no point in me being out
not being able to do anything
i'm gonna try and leave early enough
that i think that i can arrive at the
bank
like right as it's opening so first you
have to go to a telegram office
because you're gonna have to tell rogers
to wire you money and then he'll wire it
to the bank and the bank will have it
waiting for you
oh yeah if rogers is paying for this
then that's what i'm doing
oh i mean or oh if you want to do your
own money then you just need you can
just write a letter
to the bet you can write a letter of
credit to the bank
than i i want less stops in this case
this is an emergency
sure okay so yeah you you essentially
um you write the 20s version of a
checked cash which is a letter of credit
to the to to the bank guaranteeing that
you will pay
them that and so you um
yeah you can you you pull out what a
couple thousand
you know is that well i'm just gonna
rent a truck
not buy one that's the real evil of you
guys
i rent a truck and then it explodes
like here's my renter's insurance it's
very optimistic we're not going to stay
how many like abandoned rental cars are
there still in new york
at least two that i can think of i have
nothing to do with any of those
uh all right so yeah you you can you
know you you ask at the bank and they'll
tell you a place that you can rent a
truck
and i'm also going to want to pick up
things like clean bed rolls and a
change of clothes and just anything else
for like to be sanitary and a lamp that
i can put in the back of the truck
to work on sure you
you work yeah you get a truck and you
yes i'm gonna check that off though
there's no there's no box
you don't get to check it off nope that
and cthulhu ethos are two skills that
don't improve
or you know well improve
through i don't know if it's called
an improvement
uh so yeah you you get you get you're
well situated you buy like
some you buy some random clothes of
sizes that you think people are yeah no
i'm going for looser
people are just gonna deal with baggy
clothes but they'll be new and clean
there you go yeah you buy so you buy a
bunch of stuff and then you
drive the truck up to the warehouse and
you know
up to it so no one can see any and you
know you give the
the three honks that you said was the
symbol oh
knock on the door i'm not making loud
honk sounds not drawing attention to
myself
all right so yeah you now all live
in the back of a truck
uh there are some bedrolls basically
uh if unless you're gonna be more
comfortable than most
of you probably want to be like two or
three of you can sleep in the back at
any given time
uh because there's there's a fair amount
of stuff in the back of this truck now
uh there's there's benches on either
side so you can sit
on them when you're not when someone's
not sleeping on them
uh it is you know it's a truck
uh so are you just gonna drive around
now is that your
i mean we'll try and find discreet
places when we need to if places look
abandoned we can just have to have it
parked i want us i want to spend more
time working on donal
okay so are you going to stay at this
warehouse
are there any objections are there any
concerns any better ideas
yeah we need to get explosives and blow
this lady's house up
we need to get that jade you need to get
the statue at first
then blow the house up so we're going to
keep the truck parked here
that sounds fun yes this isn't a
warehouse associated with anyone that we
know
that we know of wow how am i going to
buy explosives if the
i'm not going to answer that no no we're
working on uh
let's have a look at donald where
if i mean black market weren't totally
run by
madame lynn madame lynn and i would
probably i don't know would i go back to
the i would probably go back to the bar
where we met taro the first time
oof that's her bar
yeah oh damn it okay
we're gonna start being like pictures of
emma everywhere
yeah wanted with all hearts
yeah yeah us embassy that's where i'm
going
i need some explosives are you oh my
boss
aren't you wanted criminals in new york
yeah no no that was that was cleared up
and i had nothing to do with that so no
i'm not specifically
none of my characters are wanted in new
york but
at and we also should still have our our
fake passports
weren't we talking about using the
portal to go
and get the jade statue can they look i
think we're going to
okay open up at her house
and from there straight to egypt got it
got it so we get the jade
statue but that means we all have to go
or we have a meet-up location yes
we find a pay phone and we
make a call what i don't think there
were payphones in the 20s
payphones existed in such a short weird
amount of time
where would where would there be now i'm
going to google this
yeah no this would be good i mean madame
lynn has a phone in her house
when when were superman comics written
because yeah that's that's a superman
thing i was thinking a tardis we could
that's that's the 1960s though
yeah wow the first cell
the first phone booth was put up in
night in 1889
there were many thousands of them by the
turn of the century that number only
continued to grow into the 1920s
so you know there will be a few in
shanghai not a ton but there will be a
few
oh there we go lee
that's your history fact for today kids
look at that we we keep you up at night
and we educate you
and since what was happening while i was
swimming i looked up the fact that you
can't get a grenade launcher until 1950
so that really upset me
that's that's why i came out of the pool
asking or came out of the pool came out
of the
came out of the water asking for um
explosives as opposed to a grenade
launcher
yeah you you know using your
extensive knowledge of demolitions emma
you think that being dipped in the ocean
was probably not great for these
grenades
no they probably don't work anymore emma
we can always buy a lot of fuel
and put them in the back of this truck
drive them to her house dump the fuel on
their house and burn it down i think you
need that statue first
that's a great idea that's how we get in
but that's a terrible walk
it's a great idea though so we watch and
wait for her to leave
then we light the truck on fire roll it
into the front door
we're not talking grab the statue
portal to egypt plan made
portal's just not going to magically
show up we need to call no this is
horrible
we can arrange for the ports on the
hold on hold on hold on hold on i i
think it would probably be wisest for
the good doctor to spend some time
uh working on donald getting him patched
up
um and then he and i go and scout out
madame lens
we wait for her to leave then the two of
us
sneak in get the statue and meet you
three at a prearranged location
where we where we will meet a portal and
go to egypt
you can always come back and get trash
your house later yes we can
but he's he's recovering
i've been severely injured before fella
this isn't the first time
so we should go to egypt first then come
back
jay matthews makes the point that the
plan can't go bad if you don't have a
plan
exactly not wrong i've
you know i've never added a chat thing
to the possible
episode titles but i think that is a
where where that badge with pride j
matthews
i think we like first no
but i do think we need to get the
jade statue before we
we run away to egypt i think we just
because then we can go from there
instead of having
because if if we get the if we get the
jade statue we don't have to stop
in shanghai the next time that we make a
run
at grey dragon island yep you never come
back to this town again and that'd be
fine with me
i would prefer that agreed
you're saying if we could blow up our
i'll see what i can do thank you yeah
she was trying threw me a thousand feet
into the water blowing your house
i don't like that monkey either so i'm
on the same page
and we can't kill her i i i refuse to be
explosives
no okay so let's discuss the
metaphysical
um
i'm working on donald trump yeah yes yes
yes who can multitask
yeah i was like how does that work if
you blow her up with explosives who
takes the monkey's place
who set off explosives exactly
well what if four people like lit
different
fuses and stuff what would happen i
don't want to be stuck in a monkey with
the four of you
yeah i i will i will point
no it's a firing squad it would work
like a firing squad
i will i will point out that we do know
that it is possible for killing one
magical gorilla to create two because
that
is how ping and and tun were created
they both killed the ancient magical
gorilla
she's right now that i did that we could
end up
with four it could be the gorilla squad
no
no we already have these these gorgeous
um
these these these coasters that were
made for us
they're gonna become gorillas no shave
off the ears dude
gorillas are saying shave off the ears
and change the d
to a g great girl if only ezra
had magical talking great danes
that's his fault really then we
did then we would literally be the
anyway so make me a medicine roll dr
hollister
inspire luck no that's a hard success
oh nice all right i have the best poker
face ever
so with a hard success donald you're
immediately gonna get
five hit points back and
now every day that you rest you're gonna
if you rest for a whole day your major
wound will be gone
i'm resting okay yeah well
that being said i'm a bad person but if
there's a moment
where if like i'm working on him and i'm
like you have to like roll over
something i don't think anyone else is
looking he's getting the morphine
i'm putting him out all right crazy talk
about him going off on an expedition
all right yeah there's you got a hard
success
so donald is unconscious for the rest of
of
no it's the it's a smart thing to do
uh and so you'll get you'll lose the
major wound and you'll get three points
back
excellent so then i i suppose the
question is do
is alexander going to go and try and do
this on her own keeping in mind
that the full moon is on the 8th
well we've effectively lost a day
yeah planning you could spend the day
i don't know doctor hurdles i i i don't
know doctor how well does blood
keep would it be
advisable to get blood of the innocent
here or should i wait until
egypt the fact that i am asking this
with a straight face
i mean i'm pretty sure i've got syringes
i'm actually i'm actually thinking about
this in earnest what do i
would i know the ways to okay we get an
ice box
and interesting story as i i went down a
little bit of a rabbit hole
uh after last episode when rogers
suggested they were looking into
synthetic blood and that sort of thing
uh blood banks were not a thing for a
while yet
uh refrigeration was the major issue uh
refrigeration is still
a nascent technology and requires a
lot of space and a lot of room
most people's ice boxes are still
literally ice boxes
uh and so it is uh
there is not a lot of saving blood going
on in the
in the early 20s i mean well ice is not
that expensive we could get an
ice box we could keep so you're gonna
need for blood you're gonna need more
like dry ice
you're gonna need some really cold stuff
well i mean ice is going to work for a
while though i'm just thinking like how
long is that ice going to keep how long
would
ice chest keep it we can keep it for a
while yeah but trying to get an ice
chest and move it with us to egypt
egypt i thought we were going to do the
ritual here on
gray dragon island that we were
approaching when the
got torn to pieces that's no we're
i'm we're we want to steal the figurines
so we have it ready
so that when we make the next run at
gray dragon island we at least
don't have to make the stop in shanghai
yep
i'd rather not do this but uh
i can send a telegram to rogers to try
we don't need a cell in telegram right
if we're going to use a portal to go
right we can tell him then
that won't give him time to have it
prepared and it will be on
us and there may be
uh moral advantages to that
you guys need a martyr you're
conscious she doesn't need a martyr
no it makes sense i'm assuming we would
just and i don't know how the portals
work but i'm assuming we would go from
here to
to the bread pyramid
no we go from here to the bunker and
then from the bunker
dc
okay ideally we would space that out as
to give the
uh the individuals on the throne time to
recover
never happens no it doesn't but
uh time zone wise
shanghai is six hours ahead of cairo
so it's currently you know if it's if
it's um
if it's the out what is it it's like the
afternoon of the seventh so it's the
morning of the seventh
and what time is it in in dc at this
point
it is it is er it is like six hours
more so it's
it's like the day before like one in the
morning or two in the morning
uh on the seventh i think we get a
telegram off as quickly as possible
because if we
get some some of this blood that rogers
talked about
maybe we can get this capped off
tomorrow
oh you know so hollister you know that
the synthetic blood is a no star
is a non-starter at least not in the
short term
i mean i i think for the telegram that i
individuals on standby to provide it
at the location at the time
are you is are you just saying innocent
people what are you what is your
well he already knows i mean he's the
one who told me
yeah yeah he knows the prerequisites and
you know that he was like what the
that is the question isn't it that that
sparked a little
debate which i don't understand
someone who is the opposite of who you
are i mean
there is a little bit more in the ritual
itself
there is actually a little bit more of a
definition okay let's see
um the blood for the pupil of the eye
must be fresh all who chant must detest
evil oh hmm so the blood just has to be
fresh
yes although it does so it doesn't say
something about
all who so all who chant must
detest
evil and the blood is
the blood of an innocent must fill the
pupil of the eye but it does
so all it says is it must be fresh
and it must be the blood of an innocent
really though so hollister if if there
is
anyone that if there is any way that
rogers can help us
maybe have people on site to help with
this i don't know
i don't know if he knows any innocent
people in his country children
children for are are very innocent and
we only need a little bit
we're gonna drag children out to a
pyramid no no no no we have
well how fresh is fresh you put them in
a little thing and you take it out you
do it
you know what i do so understand that
i'm not the one to make moral decisions
most of the time and i have a moral
objection to that
you know i didn't think that my blood
would qualify but by contrast
i feel like i have good odds really you
guys don't think that that that that
to to save the world we would you could
i mean
we're not talking about taking all the
blood of someone
so i don't understand we take kids kids
take blood tests all the time for things
we
tested so what you're saying is we go
around pretending we're doctors
to a grade school or perhaps a preschool
or perhaps an orphanage and just say
we're here to like
do some blood testing for is the does
the u.n exist anymore
uh not yet i don't think we're just
gonna need a little bit
every beat of this drum for several
hours
did that kill some children it depends
on how many kids you have
oh yeah we get if we get if we bring a
lot of children into this
middle of the desert where that's
okay that's not what i was thinking but
i understand no
it is a not insignificant amount of
blood you'd need.
one person will not be able to do this...
well if you completely exsanguinated them perhaps
one person will not do it twice. 
if if we could get like six people
then maybe six six to seven people
because so they also suggest
they also suggest how many people you
need but you're gonna need to like
do some math or fig some figuring on
your own for that.
