we have a few quick announcements
there's been there's been a
rampaging controversy

how long they take and apparently
that wasn't even announcements that was
just banter
i'm not sure what to qualify that as you
know we
we here at question cthulhu wanna get
you into your game
as quickly as possible that being
said as always
our first announcement the sponsor with
the most
it's birds of paradise the official dice
of quests and cthulhu

is the code you get 15
off on your entire order birds of
paradise

follow on twitter because
you get like and facebook because you

uh we have uh
nord games our good friends at nord
games we love them
uh thomas mentioned in the chat but i'm
just gonna put it out there especially
hey youtube you could help us out here
we are one follower away
from 2300 followers on twitch
i believe when you get 300 followers on
twitch
nothing happens but still it you know we
like round numbers so
somebody one of y'all on youtube who
hasn't joined us on twitch
even if you don't watch the show pop
over give us a subscribe
if you've got a amazon prime or whatever
it is you've got a free twitch thing
already so you can
you can jump in and do it speaking of
subscribing
speaking of subscribing it is september
by the way september my second favorite
monthly holiday
i'm a big fan of dom tober personally
but
september is very exciting it's a lot of
fun
so during september if you ex if you
the longer you let me see if i can say
this succinctly since amy wrote war and
peace for the rules
uh the longer you subscribe for it the
bigger a discount you get
it's just that easy if you subscribe for
six months you get like 30
off if you subscribe for four months you
get less off so on
so far wow thomas says we are now two
subscribers away so
i turned someone off so badly with my
hard self
that they just unsubscribed
[Laughter]
uh well that hurts i'm not gonna lie
that hurts
was it can we track this yeah
you're supposed to use reverse
psychology everyone knows that's how you
okay hollister uh
so september you know you can't say that
enough really
just so subscribe somebody now we
need two people so two people on youtube
or if for some reason you're watching
this and you haven't subscribed yet you
know
uh get it all figured out so
we have a september we have
a mitten coming up in i think in 10 days
is the drawing or the
the ring but here's the difference this
time uh
i think thomas is running i'm not sure
who's running
no aaron's running oh aaron's running
nice
so aaron is running that's going to be
awesome and the players
are going to be you idiots all you have
to do
is be a patreon of and you're idiots
because you're playing
d and d let's be clear normally i think
very highly of you but if you're playing
d and d
yes so um
all you have to do is be a patreon of
quests and chaos
and then there's a there's a mitten sub
forum there and you can jump in and you
can play
uh you can you can you can sit on the
very same little
zoom box where tiana or nick or julie
has set i think we should run a call
of cthulhu mitten
that would be i mean nick didn't just
say something along those lines
run run one or hush it you know and and
it would be very short you guys can have
all the machine guns you want it'll be
great
uh so so that mitten
is coming up aaron's gonna run it if
aaron's running it something weird is
gonna happen
it's almost guaranteed i mean it
might just be
the game itself aaron yes aaron is a
little bit odd so you know
that is true i could just be aaron
playing characters by himself
that's literally what you could see the
whole time i also want to
shout out brayden brayden on
our on our discord is the
the magnificent fool who is running
massive nyla thought
for 24 hours straight coming up on
uh twitch for charity and it's cthulhu
for charity is the name of the twitch
channel
he's going to be doing that on september
12th starting at
2 p.m pacific time i believe he's based
in australia so it was very nice of him
to convert that to pacific time for us
that was very kind
um but i i've i've talked this up before
but i love this idea
that they're going to play for 24 hours
and at the end of 24 hours the world's
going to end so how far do the players
get
i think that burn the juju house down
just don't do anything else
house down for me i'm begging you so
dave jackson elias
do they have do they have any preemptive
knowledge of it
interesting question i don't know i mean
probably but
you know i most
player many players these days know matt
i mean macedonia thought the first time
it was around was in the early 80s so
you know even this version changes only
some things
well but but it would depend on how well
how long you've been playing call of
cthulhu i've never played call of
cthulhu before starting masks of
narlathotep so i mean i have
no previous knowledge of how this of how
this module goes
it also depends on how much the gm makes
up you know that too
yes that's a that's a big part of it
because no one would recognize this
massive nirelus hotep
fill the juju house with orphans instead
and then have them take the sand loss if
they burn it down
um oh that's awful i love it
uh so um
one other thing one other announcement
and we'll we'll say this again
but we are going to give away
us two sets of great dane society
coasters
uh ruff ruff uh
two sets of these coasters tonight
one one set is going to
one of you lovely idiots on twitch
that'll be hashtag chaos at the break
did you just pick a bite out of that
really good work and i really i really
love these i'm thinking about ordering a
bunch to give away as gifts
the the second set youtube it's your
chance
all you have to do to win this set of
coasters is a
live in the united states or canada
except quebec does this quebec really
canada
not according to the quebec not
according to the cubicle uh
so live in the us or most of canada
that's the first thing you have to do
the second thing you have to do is you
have to be subscribed to our
uh questing chaos youtube channel and
the third thing that you have to do
is share this video on whatever social
media you like
that someone uses so sorry myspace
um i don't know if if there's a bing
book you could create that you could
share it on
you know no and i hope google shut down
whatever google had they googled
google google plus google yeah yeah i
like that google plus
uh you know i mean you can put it on
linkedin if you want the like eight
people you work with to know you're a
nerd
that's and they'd be like why is
but so youtube those three steps all you
have to do
be in the u.s or canada except quebec
subscribe
to our youtube page and retweet
or read facebook or whatever
read linkedin do this episode
on social media and oh hey when you do
it you have to add us because we're not
gonna we don't we're not gonna go
looking for you
if you want to win you have to tell us
you want to win so make sure that you at
quests and chaos
uh all right amy you want to flip some
numbers
it's like vegas today all right
let's start with the fact that the
players have four yes and
has zero not to rub it in correct things
should be
oh no whatever will i not use i don't
know i don't know every once in a while
you gotta use one okay
tamagatura 500 to the players thank you
sir
yes thank you tamago squirrel 500 to the
players
thank you i'm not making you garlic
bread next time
no you want to make her garlic bread
this is because you made the salad
salad was dinner we wanted something
cold it's hot i completely understand
i'm gonna have cottage cheese and
tomatoes and avocado on break
because that's all i can tell it at the
moment cause it's too damn hot
i'm gonna get crazy and skip around a
thousand from lonely yeti to the players
wow thank you only eddie very cool yep

muffin mushroom mage the muffin page
the mushroom man well
which mushrooms are you eating wow
send some send something you said 500
from the muffin mage the next yes to the
place
we'll all be myconids it'll just be a
whole thing of mike and it's
these mushrooms didn't come from a
plastic baggie and aren't crunchy
i think you know with my contents anyway
all right and here's the big one the
monster manual too
no really for somebody who hates d
all right i have all the books memorized
i could tell you the monsters from the
original themed folio
we haven't i would just have to read it
okay this is where math gets hard so i'm
going to again
brat gave 6 000 bits of
equal distribution okay 3 000
one for each clear and one for me yep
exactly so a thousand goes to ezra
and then we're gonna do a thousand for
tiana because that's who i see in my
square
then a thousand for nick because that's
who i see next
then a thousand for julie because that's
who i see next and then a thousand for
tom because that's who i see next
holy smokes look at this stack we are up
to 17
for the record that's a big stack of
business
uh you are all ridiculously kind uh
that is honestly you probably have
better things to do
let's be clear i also want to shout
out
uh let me see i have to look for it here
uh we had
one chlorelle clarel yeah clarel
subscribe
my my so now we only need one more
person
we're breaking even yeah
actually chlorelle canceled and then
re-subscribed aha
that was it just so she got credit for
it
uh that is wonderful thank you so much
for those bits the players
uh they need everyone as we have
uh as we have figured out uh
thank you so much elder brat art yeah
that was
fit that's amazing um
so i know that's it that's it for
announcements
boom i did want to just do a quick gi
joe moment just because i'm proud of
this let's see if i can make this work
i'm wearing my serpentor shirt
and the it's it's one of the tarot card
shirts you can't see it
but at the bottom the reason that i love
this shirt
all it has is his catchphrase this i
command
serpentor was the best so which tarot
card is he
i'm guessing the king there's actually
emperor i may or may not
have on the way a a version of
this for
that a certain moderator on our
uh on our chat really
i can neither confirm nor deny that's
cool
i love it i don't normally wear black
t-shirts but you know you do what you
got to do
my my my friend dragon bait would trade
with you all she wears is black
i love oh my gosh doctor paramecium
is he gives the players 500 bits but
hello thank you welcome i'm taking one
of you
i saw you on the discord and it's like
three in the morning your time so i
really appreciate being here in germany
we we
uh we appreciate it thank you feeling
dunk
i don't speak german all i can say is
thank you and yes
uh oh man when i
uh when i went to germany in 2000 2001
or two
um we saw uh
we saw one of the the lord of the rings
movies in the german voice
oh cool and theater in speech in german
is outstanding because like often times
when they do
the when they do the the the dubbing
like especially if it's a crowd scene
it's like they double the voices so it's
this was like a choir just screaming
death
[Music]
that's two towers i think isn't it yeah
probably they didn't speech
at homes deep yeah i think that's
it has been too long i am clearly due
for a re-watch
well there goes two days yeah yeah
yeah i know i i i will spend the
entirety of a weekend watching the
extended editions
uh skip the hobbit that's i hate free
advice kids at home
i hate the hobbit films i have seen all
of them once
the the five minutes whenever it was
like hd cinema is gonna be a thing what
was it hd cinema or
the high the hike it was filmed like a
high frame rate or something
oh yeah well it was 2d for 3d is
basically what they did and it was like
trying to become a thing but it was not
a thing well and
i i i i if aaron and warren ever invite
me on to their movie talk
uh thing it will be to discuss how awful
the hobbit films are and i will just go
on a rant
i would be right there with you um
oh speaking of which thomas and i are on
their show tomorrow
oh cool and we get to talk about how bad
jim carrey is
so we should just keep it a trend just
have everybody out and be like
let me tell you what i hate
[Music]
[Laughter]
slapstick comedy oh god i think of like
good neighbor what's my favorite jim
carrey thing is
i enjoyed him okay sunshine stop
everybody eternal sunshine and the
spotless mind
that is it that is all if you can argue
with me
here's here's a sentence i i actually
enjoyed the sonic the hedgehog film
and it was mostly because of him wow
i did not expect to like that film i
expected it to be just a popcorn date
film
and then i was like that was shockingly
not bad i
kind of enjoyed that and it was a
question the first time they did it and
it looked terrible or the second time
they did it
when it was actually in theaters yeah i
haven't seen it but i've heard from
other people who are just like yeah he
made that movie
he really went all in
you can say what you want about jim
carrey he commits to a bit he really
he's like a less good will ferrell in
that regard like i don't like will
ferrell either
yeah but will ferrell just commits to
whatever he's doing a hundred percent
and carrie does that
as well and i mean now we're doing 40
minutes
and i mean on the bright side it was not
jim carrey's rendition
of a dr seuss film that kept the dr
seuss foundation from allowing any more
live-action films that was all mike
myers
that was that was pretty i think
probably truman's show is the jim carrey
movie i've enjoyed the most
yeah that's one um
i'm just looking forward to aaron's
impassioned defense of batman and robin
which one first jim carrey's performance
is the riddler
yeah so
last week things were said regrets
you know sad sad things happened
uh we got 500 more bits from tamagoto
that also was sad
and happened to ezra
oh wow to me thank you tamago not so
nice
outstanding he's taking over heft's role
of keeping things balanced
well no one should take over hep's role
what does that balance look like right
now
does we don't feel bad we
we appreciate heff's role is dangerous
for the wallet my friend
oh i thought you're gonna say dangerous
for the world i was like yeah a little
bit of that
how are we going to burn all of that in
cairo
oh oh no the inspiration i have some
suggestions
i mean amy no amy wants to burn cairo
or emma doesn't yeah she's a job
unfinished last time she was here
um so last time
uh emma you created an npc out of whole
cloth
and how did that turn out for you wait
what did i do
the guy on julio don pumpkin julio
what do you mean i love that i love that
tequila
um you you you know you came up with
the idea of a crazy guy in a basement
and we ran with it
and it didn't go well for you um
you are now have a crazy inquisitor who
is hunting you
uh perhaps with the vatican's knowledge
perhaps not
um and uh
you brought a poor innocent man to a
warehouse to be tortured
this kara betty thing was a retcon
yep it was completely i completely
blamed j matthews 85.
no that was nick's idea to have it to
have a um
alexandria's knife at emma's throat we
were talking about that after the show
and so yeah and so ezra had to bend
over backwards to figure that one out
i thought it was my fault sorry no
that was a little sorry so honestly
every
every after we run the show every night
rachel and i go for a walk
and i basically you know she helps me
figure out
the next step and so i was like yeah i
think i wanted to be
emma there so how do i get her there and
we we
went through all of the the permutations
of that
um we appreciate you rachel thank you
for the purpose
for us to alleviate guilt for isis
that's right yeah that's right
so it's fun right yeah she uh
she gives she gives you bits to make up
for the fact that she gives me ideas
that's it that's it exactly wow
now we get any more um
i hope so uh
tamangotor is right when he says rachel
is the true mastermind because
even so when we would drive down to the
studio i would like bounce ideas off of
her
and she would like make them better and
that's what rachel does is i come up
with a silly idea
and she makes it better that there's
no better descriptor of our marriage
by the way rachel tomorrow is our
two-year anniversary
cotton anniversary so i got you a whole
bunch of hanes undershirts
uh men's shirts because they were
cheaper
but you know it'll be fine but happy
anniversary my love you have
you have made my life better in every
way that doesn't involve giving the
players bits
you're gonna make me cry that's adorable
that's awesome
happy anniversary we uh
yes i'm a very lucky man so um
although ironically as soon as like we
started as soon as basically as soon as
we moved in
like rachel became uninterested in
playing games anymore
i have a gamer wife oh i don't she all
she wants to do is play stardew valley
all right well it's still gaming that's
gaming it's still gaming do nothing
do not bring your elitist crap in here
sir i have a wall of board games
i have almost as many hours and no i i'm
close to her hours in stardew valley
there you go still have a gamer wife
i yeah it's true it's true she's oh
gosh what was it there's one there's a
game that she's
done better at than she she won zelda
before i oh
i still haven't won zelda she won zelda
breath of the wild yeah
yeah i think we've got in the chaos
agents
yeah what time is it it's 6 26 we have
boom
[Music]
late hold on we started late how many
more minutes do we need to go
i said well no we're still we're still
you know i'm weaving in the recap that's
the that's the trick here
yeah so yeah so you uh
uh you created uh
an npc that is now part of the cloth of
the game
and you
uh don julio will i'm sure never pop up
again
and then you fled rome another city you
decided not to do anything
about you know
uh whoever is controlling the uh
terracotta warrior and the mummy
i hope you have never seen the money
kill him
and you left them to to trouble rome
uh and you fled another city for
uh egypt and you got into egypt and you
found out that
uh the the b teams uh
muddled cleanup
uh wow
quests and chaos is having a
conversation with itself yeah
thomas and i are basically fighting in
different rooms about did we give tamaga
torres 500 bits is that what you're
wait now i can hear us playing back at a
playback so now he'll respond
[Laughter]
um so yeah egypt has become
a a country under siege there is
a there is some sort of
rebel force that has taken over most of
the country
uh cairo is the main holdout
at this point and you have all
determined that you need to get uh
to the to the red pyramid for the
uh the ritual and i believe you dr kafur
has given you the information you need
for for the
uh for the ritual oh no sorry not dr
kafur
uh you asked somebody to do the math who
did you ask to do the math
hollister yeah i thought he did oh yeah
hollister didn't make the role that's
right
no wait what are you talking about
because there's no we actually
how many people you need for the blood
yeah last time you told us that we had
that information okay you've got that
number that's great yeah
um and you
you are in cairo preparing yourself
you're living
on you're living on a u.s military base
for the time being
so you have you have a space there in
the barracks
cairo is yours what do you wish to do
with it
don't tell us that not like that don't
um what was the math on the blood again
it was a lot of people have been a
number and told when we had the yeah
it was it was more than it was more than
a dozen people
okay you essentially have to fill
that you have to fill the eye in that
thing
every hour on the hour
all right yeah so we're looking at 13
people right
i need one more that's why as long as a
few of them don't mind getting a little
woozy
no it has to be it has to be lucky 13
exactly
okay so yeah you
you know that every hour you have to
fill
the oh
who would be left joan make me a
let's call it a pow roll make me a power
roll joan oh
oh i made it okay so um
while they're talking about the blood
you're also
thinking about the feeling you had with
the um
with the elder sign ritual and you're
guessing that there will also be
some amount of you know what you think
of as soul
uh that will need to be donated to this
and will probably be permanent
oh oh because i was going to explain it
as an oh you know like the the
you know soul draining you know you take
a little bit of the soul you put it in
it'll be great
um but yeah if it's a second i thought
you said soul training and that's very
different
so yeah it's a powdery not a mag not not
a magic point strain
i have a whole different impression of
this ritual now
[Laughter]
everybody just lines up and then down
in every hour on the hour we all go go
go go go
on julio's compatriot don cornelius
shows up
oh i do not have enough alcohol oh i
need more
uh i'm not drinking tonight i don't
think i've already
put down to his body i don't think i
could function i'm barely functioning as
it is so no
no i'm not gonna so you have cairo what
uh
what will you do with it so last time
donald was mentioning
the the pathways and looking into that
you also have emma has a letter of
introduction to
the the catholic church in cairo
let me look up their name but if we only
need 14
people that's not bad yeah
i would think it'd be a lot more it's
the diocese of saint catherine
yeah yeah so we ask for 20 and we'll
like any extra gig i mean so essentially
every hour
you have to like slice somebody open
good thing do i not have a can i not
blood can i not do this yeah you could
draw it and then fill it from a syringe
although
i'm not sure you might have to like draw
twice to fill the eye the eye
is actually not no it's it's like
when you give blood you have a little
you hold the little rubber tube and
you like pinch
i'm not sure they had those in the 20s
they had rubber they had tubes
that said though we we we we can draw
some of it you know and get and have it
ready and then when it's time just like
squirt it into into place
that's a sentence sounds
um but you know have it be very
controlled not like
alexandria goes slashing at your arm in
order in order to
have blood flow all over all over the
place which i would do
but if there's a cleaner way to do it
i think did hollister have the vision
was he the one who actually had the
vision of the sacrifices being done
or was that flint you did no you had
that vision but it was
it was that was that was slicey slicey
those were that was
that was full yeah yeah i'm i'm i'm very
interested in minimizing
well luckily you're a doctor so yeah
yeah right because just to let people
know when we're talking about feeling
the eyeball it's not just like this
little eyeball there's
there's a whole thing here yeah but it's
also not that
it's also not as bad as like slice open
someone's throat and hold them over the
toilet right
it's it's not deep but it's not like we
keep saying oh you have to fill up the
eyeball
and i i've had people go what do you
mean how big is the eyeball yeah
no it's it's the thing yeah yeah it's
the well of the
the center of what that r shape yes
yes did i already express some of my bad
ideas
no let's do that i mean today
yeah this morning um
there's a couple thoughts here what
happens if
we somehow take over the brotherhood of
the pharaoh infiltrate if you will
i think we're a little too white for
that well we're a little too late for
that
we don't have the time we don't have the
time for like
well i i think donald would remember
uh joe's attempt to infiltrate
and how rushing that goes that's right
what yeah joe almost got herself
sacrificed
last time she tried to infiltrate the
cult
yeah well they could try that'd be funny
okay so what happens if we start our own
cult because all we need are 14 people
competing cult i think it's i mean
all we really need is is the one that
already exists
the catholic church and i do have a
letter of introduction
i just need somebody who has more
persuasion than i do to do the talking
does anyone the doctor dr hollister
um i mean science and religion don't mix
[Laughter]
oh my god that's the quote of the night
right there
what would i tell them anything that i
wouldn't how about that
anything that comes out of my mouth say
the opposite that's how it works
okay if you want things to go well don't
listen to
it you you use the biblical stuff
there's plenty of stuff in the bible
about sacrifices and
innocent blood and stuff like that use
what's in there
to say you we're we're using where
we are using blood to seal up
an ancient evil yeah well we could say
that
we're in that there it's in competition
with the other cult that's taking over
uh don't say other cult when talking to
them
yeah granted they really don't there's a
better cult we could join
this one has benefits and a swimming
pool oh god what i wouldn't give for a
swimming pool right now
anyway
is there one on this hotel yeah
red army base no huh oh that's true
what if okay if
if the okay so the religious stuff with
the wine being the blood of christ
that's innocent blood can we can we
just boost
this thing up would there be a work
around for that
isn't it well isn't there some sort of
transmutation that happens as you ingest
the it's been a long time no no no no
it's before
it's before you adjust it it's like this
is the blood of christ and then you take
it right
yeah maybe if you could bring a a priest
with you to you know
have to do that part of the ritual i
but but here's the thing if that's wrong
we have to make it through another month
yeah until the next
uh he just wants to bring a lot of wine
along i mean
you don't need to make excuses for that
um the the other thing
that you recall from this might be a
good time
to go back to what the the
translation actually said
about the the ritual
uh because there were two important
notes
one was about the blood
the ritual must be performed by those
who stand against evil
well that and also and also we have to
cleanse evil before we do it
that's the hard part yes well that's
there's there is the flamethrower on
this base
waiting for us right we made that setup
or we could just do a holy water
sprinkler
you know just i don't think that's what
it means
that's not the worst idea though we need
to have that too i think would be a
sensor would be nice to have okay so we
will the
water be inflammatory so you sprinkle it
out flame throw it
it like amp never mind oh i was thinking
we have well maybe there is such thing
as holy oil
yes there is and i will not get into it
because that things into all of my
religious background and no
so you know maybe you could have real a
holy
flammable you know
uh the napalm of messina or something
oh yeah we did we made a holy vodka one
the holy hand grenade
obviously yes okay on a game which game
did i do that where i blew
liquor and lit it on fire and it was
like does that mean
that was my circus game that was the
circus game
i get all my cthulhu's confused you've
done that in this game too
right i feel it's a standard it's not
this is
a standard move yeah i swear it's
happened at least once
uh so you know you have
uh a it is by the way it is may 29th
it is the the day of may 29th
i believe so which friday let's go out
yeah so we want to go to your
introduction we want to
talk to the fellow that you that
alexandria brought up
who was that nigel was safe nigel so we
want the introduction nigel and then we
want to
look into the underground magical
tunnels
yeah if if we can't manage the tunnels
if they were
actually magical and we need some sort
of ritual to open the doors in various
places
if we're not able to use those having
nigel rent us a riverboat
and put all of the people who look like
they belong in
egypt up on the deck and those of us who
look very much like we do not belong in
egypt
down under the deck speaking of which
what do we know what the brotherhood
do they have a little uniform perhaps or
something that we could
obtain in order to blend a little bit
easier and maybe get the people on deck
to also blend and pass a little bit
easier
i don't know that seems like something
that nigel might know because he's a
journalist
even if it is of a yellow paper someone
who knows a situation that can brief us
on what we
can expect what the enemy looks like how
they're organized where they're going
yeah i mean assuming he still likes us i
am
hanging a lot on him still being
anglicized
we have to remember that nobody wants
this takeover none of the locals on the
establishment wants
this takeover we have allies here there
are people that would like to get rid of
the brotherhood
so we just have to mobilize them didn't
didn't you say that that you met people
when you were here with the rest
of the the secondary team that were
ministers
yeah oh the secretary of state was a
lovely man
unfortunately there were several of us
that were doing security myself savannah
and whatnot but there were two members
of our team
the doctor and then the other emma who
met made contact
with several of the local established
wealthy
uh influential people in this town i
mean doyleson's a charmer i can see him
doing that
i think he was conscious along for a
ride he's a good fella but yeah he
wasn't much of a talker
there was that other emma who was
everything but mostly because
i will say this because tiana x carded
that had nothing to do with the doctor
and everything to do with nope i can't
anyway there must be wealthy egyptians
who don't want the brotherhood to just
take over their city and take all the
property
and execute them so i think they might
have a motivation
to perhaps hate us in this endeavor and
hopefully they have guns
we have guns well i i don't know if we
necessarily need
guns so much as we need support and
getting being able to get people
to the pyramid we need to get in and out
and unlock that so
so let's let's get started on something
while we burn daylight
right so what are we going to do first
nigel do we want to go to nigel first we
we need to talk to nigel
and we i think even before we talk to
nigel we need to figure out if we can
use those tunnels
that donald talked about there must be
someone who knows in this town the
history
of those tunnels someone who could use a
library perhaps
you could find out where they're located
if if we can use those tunnels
it will we we won't have to see the
surface
at all which means it's a lot it's a lot
safer
and i'm sure the military has recon you
know i'm sure they just didn't hide
here i'm sure they're probably sending
missions to fly over
to find out where yeah where the enemy
is
i'm not getting another plane though but
no more
do i know do i still know somebody at
the library
and donald as b.a barakas
you're going to have to put me to sleep
right yeah what for the
i'm sorry i still have a contact at the
library here or is the library
outside of our purview right now
uh yeah sure you stole the contact there
uh you could you also
have i mean whoever has taken over for
dr kafur
you know you might want to connect with
so i just want to point out really
quickly that the tunnels are not going
to be a panacea
those are used by the henchmen of the
black pharaoh
so we shouldn't assume that they're
empty and that we won't meet resistance
however
we should still look into them i just
want to make sure we don't think that
we're going to go in and it's going to
be smooth sailing
i mean i mean if that's the case it'll
be a
smaller narrower area it's easier to
deal with situations like that instead
of a desert where we can be
swarmed and overwhelmed yeah i would
rather deal with small close quarters
than a wide open desert with hundreds of
people coming down on us
that's where philanthropies come into
play there are creatures in the desert
there are numerous
awful creatures that swarm those deserts
i've seen them you mentioned the
sphinxes
i remember that now something worse hey
donald make me an intelligence role
while he's doing that the muffin mage
gave us a thousand bits to do something
not intelligent start a war between the
us and egypt
oh no critical success hey those
horrible things that
came they came up out of the ground
yeah during the rituals the planes are
the best planes are the best answer then
oh poor donald trump so they came out
from the tunnels the tunnels are teeming
with all of the pharaoh's monsters i
know i i don't think it was the tellers
it was a ground
that kim rose from the the sands
themselves
yeah out of tunnels i don't know
i don't know
um so you do remember
and alexander brought this up once
before but you do remember that you have
to
there has to not be evil present at the
site where you're going to do it
so part of your plan has to involve
figuring out
how to get rid of whatever evil is
around
diversion flamethrower diversion
a diversion you know if we do start a
war between the us and egypt they're
gonna have to send the forces to
wherever
that war starts no no no we we rent out
a venue in cairo
and we have like an evil seminar
free tickets yeah it's all about house
flipping
we mail that out and then they all show
up there
i i recognize that i am english not
american
however it seems like the americans are
trying very hard
to stay out of conflict here in
egypt so that the treaties can be
maintained if you want to start a war
there's one ready made between egypt and
england
it's too late to make a pyramid scheme
and then you dad joked it in there
anyway
wait what about wait what about those
elder signs don't those repel evil
so technically the eye repels evil but
there can't be evil around it when it is
being activated
first to make a space we can use and
then
put the eye in fact i mean i've been
there for
one of the activations of an elder sign
joan you were part of
one of them those take a long time
they can take a while you have to to to
gather the
uh and do the sketching and you have to
do the the ritual
um but it was less than one night
all right so let's say we were able to
get a good-sized
elder elder sign inscribed into a stone
perhaps and we put it down
close to the pyramid and we're able to
imbue it with enough power
to repel evil it's still going to take
us at least two nights
to do the elder sign and then do
um the ritual itself yes
yes that is that is a lot of time for
people to come up on us
seminar looks like the best idea i hate
it i'm sorry
it does though i mean it really it's not
i mean it doesn't have to be a seminar
but it's just
we have to create a scenario where
whoever was
you know wherever they need
reinforcements right
from the pyramid here's what we do all
right the insurgency
okay oh wait the the loyalists the
egyptian loyalists counter attack
a counter-attack somewhere along the
front which draws all their forces away
the americans could supply weapons
ammunitions whatever
to the loyalists to help aid them in
their counter-attack which would draw
the reinforcements of black pharaoh's
forces into battle
and perhaps buy us a few days while they
fight over parts of egypt
i don't know if the americans would be
willing to do that they are trying very
hard to
not appear as if they are supporting any
side
rogers might want to do it he knows why
he doesn't want them to do it
rogers potentially but i mean aside from
the usual american thing of getting
there
sticking their neb into everywhere that
they don't belong um
i i don't know that they want to turn
this
from a powder keg into an outright
explosion
yeah the force of the black fair they're
um they're they're marxists right
they're all marxists
and the americans of course they're
opposed to marxism that would be good
they're they they hate those fellows uh
everything they stand for
i don't think that's a thing yet i don't
believe right now we're
we're actually allied with this with the
communists
yeah i think so yeah so where's their
headquarters
is it at these would all be great
questions to ask someone that knew
yeah we got to find them we got to get
we got to go get them i
i think that talking to nigel was safe
is one of our best first steps
searching the tunnels possibly in the
library possibly making connections with
whoever
um the doctor's replacement is poor
fellow
tamago torres suggests you build a a
fake pyramid for them to guard
interesting oh an inflatable one there
it is
i was thinking exactly the same thing
like wait a second it's just a big
bouncy house cut out
i grew up now don't
don't don't talk to amy about bouncy
houses
[Laughter]
best idea yet it was great
so you guys head to the the
uh mr wasif's yeah
yes please let's see yesterday well well
why we're at the base
with the questions we want answered we
do have military persons we have the
person who briefed us
we google find him and ask him really
the ceo
of the base we're going to ask him to
brief us the what who who
supports the co well if
he was willing to brief us once i'm sure
he'd care a little more like
he clearly doesn't have a problem
talking to us no one would ever believe
uh so you you wanna what do you wanna
ask
the the commanding officer
uh if we know their major basis of
operation
and india make me a luck role and if
they have
uh oh dice i totally forgot about that
we use dice for this game don't we and
then
you know if they have any distinguishing
uh
here's one dice here's two dices only
episode 56 you've only been on here
since episode 14.
what how many pieces of dice do you own
nick just curious okay so yeah
that's a that is a 20 and my luck is
very high
i love how he ignored your question amy
all right so
uh yeah he'll he'll tell you that uh
their base
seems to be down the nile
towards towards the the red pyramid
um they have been pushing
hard north up the the you know up the
nile valley
trying heading for cairo there's been
skirmishes
um but they seem to be sort of
consolidating their
uh their position and not advancing
currently
and wait what was that i'm sorry
with the with the the remainder of the
egyptian army
who's fighting them yeah so the egyptian
army is fighting
the brotherhood of the black pharaoh
and are they
uh do they have any sort of uniform was
the last
thing that emma was asking about
brotherhood
yeah they tend to wear
uh black robes with red head coverings
ooh during the day fashionable
they're just gonna die from heat stroke
this is this is just a waiting game
keep feigning assaults just to draw them
out into the sun then be like oh we're
retreating again and then they're like
you mother
when our when our great crusaders fell
at some place that i can't remember when
saladin
they drew them out into the desert and
smoked them out with smoke
i'm just saying it's a it's a i'm not a
military historian
i'm always impressing things i'm always
if anything to do with smoke and fire
and cured meats and alcohol
then i know all of it there you go
that's it cured meats and alcohol
the way to your heart that's it cured
meats and alcohol now we know
commander i know that the americans
tried to remain
neutral in this conflict right yeah
i don't know if the state department has
an opinion on who you'd like to see win
this
war between the rebels of the desert and
the established
egyptians is there any word on that uh
but perhaps we may want to aid one side
or the other
we we very much would like for the
british to
come back and control things
if it's unsure that will happen no
and if that's not the case what's the
well we haven't had a lot of contact
with the red with the rebel forces
uh they seem to be disorganized there
hasn't been
um there's not really a political
platform
do the english still control the suez
barely i imagine they'd want to retain
that
yes
i don't want to sign up the english god
dammit and i just like elbow him in the
rim
just like come on you swallowed more
bitter pills than that deer
so do we want to split up because it
sounds like
last from from what information i have
our relationship with nigel is
relatively good and we're not going to
need to
persuade him or anything like that he's
either going to be on board or he isn't
or if that's the case do
a couple of us want to go talk to him
and then the rest of us do something
else
well from what i'm from what i'm
remembering meta gaming out of game he
he really he remembered alexandria from
her
uh offer days yes so
using that as a point of leverage yeah
no and i wouldn't mind
helping and going and trying to figure
out all the info
so yeah i would say metagame wise i have
a higher library skill than i do a
persuade
i mean it it sounds like we have a
library group to
research the the tunnels and we have a
newspaper group
am i reading that right sounds good
all right well if he's still thoroughly
anglicized
i can use that i think let's go talk to
him
man all right so who's going to wasif
yeah right here and joan or no jones
going to the library jensen in the
library
okay so emma's library too right yep
all the eggheads off to the library
i'm probably going to be of sl i might
be of use at the library
but i'm not terribly elder brat gives
the players 500 more bits
to blow up another pyramid as a
distraction that is a great idea
i like that um
you know you're just starting to reach
the stage where bombers are a thing
and right now bombers are basically
people dropping things off of the side
of an airplane
just like a bicycle except in the sky
okay ah all right well
yeah i guess i guess i'll go the library
i was like you know i got some
persuasion but yeah
no i also got a library soon
all right so both of both
groups as you travel through the cities
again um
this is a lockdown city there are
military vehicles
in the street there are soldiers uh
around a fair amount uh
and there's a lot of there's a lot
of asking non-white people for their
papers
uh and you uh
uh but you you guys can travel fairly uh
fairly easily around so you both make it
to your your locations
um so at the newspaper the cairo
bulletin
um you come in
and i think at least one of you
has been here
alexander's have you you haven't been to
the newspaper did you meet him at the
club
yeah we did we met
um in the newspaper
uh as you're coming as you come into the
office
there are three or four people
working there
and they are all wearing very tradition
one thing you've noticed about the city
is that people are wearing much more
traditional dress
there's a lot less of like suits and
that sort of thing
um and that is very true here
uh as you come into the newspaper uh
uh you get a sense of um
uh well somebody will
uh say to you well we'll speak to
you in
sorry doesn't does anyone speak
english
uh one moment
and he'll go and um
out from a little office steps nigel
wasif
he is in a white robe from head to toe
he's
he's got the lawrence lawrence of arabia
starter kit
going on and
may i help you yes we did we just had a
couple of uh
questions for you is there any way
that we could speak in private perhaps
right and yeah
of course of course and he he brings you
to his office
and he gestures you both in
uh and then he stands inside the doorway
with the door open
and he like um
he says he rapid fire says some things
in arabic
and and then he turns around
and sort of a little too loudly says now
how may i help you imperialists and he
i'm very sorry but i have to keep up
appearances now
no i i completely understand hello it's
yes yes it a lot much has changed
since your last visit so i've gathered
not like
like like like give his outfit a once up
and down yes
we we will try not to take up much of
your time
we were hoping we we only just arrived
in cairo this morning we were hoping
to get some information from you about
well about
two months ago um
something happened at the plantation of
what was his name omar al-shakti
and from that moment on there was a
uh that started a rebellion that has
picked up steam and taken over
much of the country uh
the the the english who already were
were having a very tenuous hold
uh the egyptian army took advantage of
the
uh of the unrest to drive the english
out and now
the egyptians think they they think they
control cairo and now they're trying to
negotiate with this
uh brotherhood do you have
any sense for how that is going do they
have any actual
leverage to negotiate with the
brotherhood or are the brotherhood just
looking to
sweep through and wipe it all out
well that's part of the problem my my
sources in the department of state
say that that there are no terms
the the brotherhood of the black pharaoh
they're not they're not a political
organization
are you familiar with the cult of the
black pharaoh that the brotherhood had
replaced
i i'm not cults and things like that
seem a little far-fetched omar was the
the leader of that until he was removed
uh he was a criminal right he was a
he was a crime lord that
okay um
but in any event the they they don't
they're not interested in negotiating
so then do you know what the egyptian
army is planning to do i mean if you
can't
negotiate with them what do you do
well the the military is trying to blow
them up
i think is there and so far they've been
most most resistance members are not
keen at being blown not keen on being
blown up
i mean they they seem to be growing in
numbers from the countryside
but there are also there are also
awful stories of just atrocities
happening
out in the villages being destroyed
out of character i'm trying to remember
what else we wanted from him
well we'd like to find a way to help
egypt not be overrun by this brotherhood
so we have a common interest here
who do we speak to to see if we can work
together to to stop this insurgency
sorry you want
to i'm afraid that
um this is not the time for
uh well it might be different for
americans
but i'm not american i know an english
person and an irish
person speaking to the department of war
would not go well right now we have
we have a few americans as our as our
allies and our friends
that might go to go over a little better
it could um
this is as i unders i mean
as near as i can tell the the
provisional government the
provisional egyptian government is
trying to turn its back
on the west and turn
uh and and and return to
a more ottoman sensibility
that's not going down they're gonna need
some allies if they want to win this war
so who are they looking to talk to
what well right now they're looking to
talk to that brotherhood and
and understand they're trying to
understand what they want because they
want to make a deal with them they'd
rather make a deal
a pan-arab deal if they can
but if the brotherhood doesn't have any
terms
how far do you push until you say there
there's nothing that can be done here
it's true that's a question for the
uh the ministry of state
that i have been uh
as far as i know they haven't they've
how long do i want to wait i mean what
point do they
realize that this these guys can't be
negotiated with
well i mean hopefully soon uh
the the other challenge as i understand
it
is that the the army
you know every day that passes the army
the there's there's speculation
i i happen to know through my sources
that this is false
but there's speculation that the
brotherhood of the black pharaoh will
leave the suez canal to the english
and thus and thus not not cause
a problem with the english and that has
been enough
um the english are unfortunately taking
a wait-and-see attitude
they they're not sure that the
you know a new regime might not be a
little more
uh a little more willing to play ball
but if if this regime is unwilling to
negotiate even with the the the egyptian
army what on earth makes them think
they'll negotiate with the english
uh i'm guessing ego
okay and the
is there anyone in states that you know
that you could put us in contact with
perhaps we could give them help in this
war
do they want any help in this war i
could
yes i could try i'll have to find
someone who's willing to speak to
uh westerners
that that's become somewhat dangerous
these days
sure would they like to speak to a
westerner that doesn't like western
governments
how about that that might be a little
too nuanced for the current situation
i'll do what you can fella yes yes
are you staying at the the ritz i can
send a messenger there or i could come
by
our location we'd like to keep that to
ourselves at the moment we can contact
you within 24 hours and
there's some news all right well uh
so yeah i'll i'll have an answer for you
in 24 hours
then come back tomorrow and i will
try and put you in connection with
somebody at the
at the ministry of state thank you very
much
that is well i truly appreciate it yes
um
i'm going to tell you something that i
have told no one else
in the service of the english and
uh my job has become
but uh
i i'm still sending reports and
um i am very worried that
my countrymen that my
they are not they're as i said they're
waiting
and seeing who how this shakes out and
how they can make a deal with whoever's
left or
how they can take over from whoever's
left
that might be the easier option but the
i would say radicalists but that doesn't
go far enough
it's a cult fellow that they have got
their mindset is not of
earthly matters they've got other
religious bents
on their mind like jihad
or oh worse yes yes
i see well
um then why aren't they striking towards
uh mecca or one of the other
they're protecting important cultural
relics within their sphere of domain
to allow enough time for they've got a
belief system
for at some point there are
the fellow they worship will come back
and you know bring about the whatever
hell on earth or what not so there they
do not follow islam
no no they don't that we know
interesting
nor do they follow christianity or any
religion
i see are there islamic allies we should
be looking to perhaps
uh well i mean the
the egyptian government is has reached
out to
unfortunately turkey is no longer a
friend to the islamic world
uh they would have been our first uh
area but we have
um we're trying to reach out to some of
the other
uh groups around here it's um
i mean you
you should know as well as i do that uh
most of it is now english territory
right
and only egypt has thrown off the the uh
uh i you'll you'll forgive me i've i
i've been playing my part a little too
long the yolk of
english imperialism now i understand
um i confess i don't know
a great deal about the politics of this
region are there any other
muslim states of any sort of power
nope the english pretty much it's
pretty much
huge amounts swaths of english territory
damn
that's right well i think i
think i've complained about this before
but like
winston churchill is responsible for a
huge
number of problems in this area because
he literally arbitrarily drew up
countries in the middle east when he
worked
in the english the ministry of state
and just
created random places and just forced
people of of different tribes to get
together in a new
country just like sure what's thousands
of years of culture what does that
matter
yeah yeah well a little bit about
overthrowing the
english yoke so if they want to speak to
someone about that
i'd be happy to again i'm i'm afraid
it's there this is um
this is a dangerous time to be white in
cairo
yeah i would suggest um
after dark being careful i don't intend
to be out after dark if i don't have to
be
fine fine all right so at the library
um you guys are looking for information
on tunnels
uh ancient magic tunnels ancient magic
tunnels
sure and the black pharaoh in general i
want to see if there's anything else
that i can stir up if there's anything
here
emma is there anything in particular
you're looking for
i don't think so i think i'm just
[Music]
where do you so i'm having a question
still about the innocent blood
what and trying to define what is
innocent
in that time well maybe you should head
to the church instead
that could only go well like it did last
time
i know i'm like it's all gonna go
epically bad
um can you just do like the the
the pale mary's or whatever and then
you're innocent
i mean the chances are they've not heard
yet that
i mean it's not like every church
bulletin has your picture in it
saying beware of this yet
yet so if i do some something at the
library it would just be on the
sacrifice part
so like what were common rituals and
sacrifices or you know what i mean just
to kind of gain some more perspective
do you also we want to look up some more
safety i mean we talked about the runes
but maybe there's some other things that
we could do to make us safe too
all right yeah does the ankh mean
anything stuff like that well for the
occult
stuff you feel like the museum is a
much better option than the library
yeah i was just thinking we had some
allies in the library when we were
looking up some of the occulty stuff
yeah sure it's you you actually
met a grad student
i was gonna a grad student
you have a history of doing that but
um um
you know the the library is not a you
know
a great source for a culture right that
it's more history
and that's and and you know that sort of
thing the museum is really
okay so did we actually go to the museum
then
well it's gonna say if you i'm done okay
i was going to say do we go to the
library first and go oh
no this isn't this isn't working it's
like you head to the middle yeah
uh you meet ahmed who was dr
kafur's assistant who is now
dr kefor's in dr kapoor's role
uh and uh
he remembers well let's see who would he
remember he remembers joan
uh didn't you who stole a book
who stole a book you're people who
aren't there
that's right yeah all right so the the
the the book was not stolen by you guys
all right that's good
oh no we're associated with those
people
who who here knows where he kept his
stash of space mead
left joan does yeah
uh so you
uh ahmed will is happy to help you
out
um and he you know he is another one who
really regrets
how things have worked out and
wants to return to the way
egypt was and he's very worried about
this brotherhood so he wants to help you
in any way he can so um
so first you look for stuff about uh
tunnels and and that sort of thing and
um you find in that in in in the more
information you were looking for about
the black pharaoh
you find a reference to um
the black pharaoh having uh
some sort of minion uh
although ahmed says that the the word
minion in this case
also has almost an animalistic kind of
uh overtone to it
uh that could create
uh tunnels in minutes
i you know at this point if he can get
us a little bit of information i'll
start telling him that
you know because he knows about what's
going on out there and he knows the cult
and
we're going to drop the black pharaoh
word to him
he he knows what's going on out there
yeah yeah but he does not
he's he's like yes it's terrible
there's a
there's a revolution going on i hope the
some of the people were in the
resolution resolution
revolution are cultists of the black
pharaoh
oh this is more of the cofour stuff
isn't it yes you remember that
yeah once dr kefor left we did not
quite intentionally i i don't blame you
but at the same fact is
that these cultists
they want to know they want the black
that's why they're trying to take over
this off more importantly
they believe in the mythology of the
black pharaoh
yes and they're going to behave in that
way and the more that we can
understand the past of the cult gives us
more
insight in how they're going to behave
now
they believe that things like these
tunnels exist
then they might use that as patterns to
try and behave
so being able to figure that out could
be incredibly useful for us
right if we can figure it out about if
they have those tunnels that would be
awesome
uh so he like yeah he'll start going
mainly through history books
um you know most of the information
about the black pharaoh was exiled from
all of the histories of the time there's
uh a few
small instances most of them
involving his queen knight of chris
who who um
you know was was she was forsaken
everlasting life and
when she died um
her heart was used as a ward to keep the
black pharaoh from returning
and there is a prophecy that the
black pharaoh will not reign over
egypt as long as knight across the
okay
and in in in our beliefs
if if someone was denied
everlasting life you know normally their
heart would be put in an optic jar and
and that would the heart would stop
beating
um if her heart was handled in a
different way
uh it would symbolically be considered
to still be beating and still be uh
okay do you have any records about the
excavation
pyramids yes yes uh
what do you need to know about them
there are so underneath
both pyramids there are extensive uh
subterranean uh
and was there what kind of like drawings
on the wall were there
um you know just was it typical funerary
stuff or was it
different you emma remember some of
those drawings on the wall
i know that's does he know that i know
uh no he says okay oh it seemed to be
fairly
um i don't see anything here that that
talks about them being extraordinary in
so would would you be able to
show me some of the the texts talking
about the black phone walking me through
them just to
just so i can see if there's there's
anything relevant
yes do you do you speak do you not
so that maybe are in arabic some of them
are in coptic
uh don't have coptic but i can also
try to read
it's no problem yeah great
uh so yeah if yeah he'll he'll read you
you know there are so there's there's
the sections about
um nighty chris and uh
sort of the whole bit about her heart
and there is uh
stuff about how the black pharaoh
uh what finally defeated the black
pharaoh
was was a
a a um
uh am i able are we able to
because he mentioned that that servant
creature are we able to use that as a
thread to suss out any more information
uh it seems that whatever these
these things are they they
bore these tunnels remarkably quickly
and then they can fill them up
and what do you think if you had to
guess what the creature was
from what we we understand animals what
do you think it is like half lion half
beetle i don't you know the more more
like a worm
yeah okay the more that we can
understand it
it gives us information to potentially
research whatever like
some sort of like mythological
equivalent be like oh he might be
talking about this
and then if we know what this is then we
might understand the tunnels better
i mean as far as the description and
what it does it seems more like a worm
where worms devour and then excrete
the the the material they are
tunneling through
i mean according to the
the reports we have on those tunnels
though
uh it looks like they're still in
operation
oh my that's that's amazing anytime
who has it can make a kakulu mythos role
oh boy okay while i'm rolling i do
have another question about
like do we know whose tombs like who all
the tombs were buried underneath
the pyramid oh thank god 75.
can we use inspiration we've got a lot
of it
wait do you think it's using inspiration
yeah it's a 44 i still lose thank god
oh that's outstanding joan doesn't have
any cthulhu mythos
yeah she does i i rolled and i was i
didn't make it so
we roll do you want to re-roll re-roll
if i
do it you have to do it if i have to
risk my sanity so do you right
all right we're we're pulling us straws
here we have very little
yeah no 82. all right is that it was was
yes would like to remind you that you
can spend luck i would like to remind
you
you could push the roll no
there's no way nothing bad ever happens
from pushing a cthulhu mythos role
nothing bad happens from pushing roles
period alexandria would like to remind
you
i had one good push but that was it
all all of hollister's pushes have been
good
you just hand him a fold-up chair he
will he will push
every roll ptsd is a strong force my
friend
but yeah no no no that was that was bad
all right so the tombs excavated
who's underneath them so where's all
their stuff they were executed
uh and uh
one of them most of the they've been
mostly cleaned out by grave robbers
that was where the clive expedition you
know and
um sorry no the climb expedition found
yeah that was where the clive expedition
uh nope sorry that was in giza in
giza the clive expedition
found knight and chris not
nidacres and she disappeared
um isn't it terrible what happened to
um and uh
there were um
the there were most of it had been
had been stripped from grave robbers
there were a few functionaries
uh the the the so-called black pharaoh
was not buried
under there there was he was not given a
tomb
okay i'll all pull them aside
and do we want to do we want to spend
any more time here
one last thing the one last thing i
wanted to see if there was any other
safety rituals or or anything like that
that we could do other than
than the making magic stones
um i wanted to see if there was anything
else that
we could possibly do so i that that's
the only that's the last piece
okay we have
we have any number of uh
tomes that you know purport to have
rituals and that sort of thing
um do you have any of dr cofour's books
yes yes i haven't read most we we
pretty much keep those books
they've been locked up since he went
away can we
is there any chance that we could see
them
of course of course yeah he'll bring you
to that reading room yep i was going to
say we we
we know about the reading room yeah uh
and he'll unlock it
and he'll he'll apologize but he says
he has to be in the room now
okay and
um there are you know there's
all the books including the necronomicon
which apparently
they don't understand how awful it is
now the problem is joan you happen to
know that like
learning anything from these books takes
days yeah yeah if not weeks
i was just trying to see if there was if
there was something else that that
you know that that like like one more
step like how do i make it faster
to make these maybe or something like
that is there anything like that
well is there any he could actually have
some there could be some historical
knowledge in these books
right i mean there are there they're
coldish
but this is where we would be likely to
find even if it's like heavily
symbolic because because cofour was
looking into the black pharaoh
correct yes
yes we have
uh the museum has made a
decision that dr kefor's
was not appropriate he was not
conducting uh
uh he was not conducting research in a
manner that
uh befits an institution like this
museum
i mean at this point we don't have many
more options though no we have
access to those notes please do do
they did they throw them
out or do they just put them in a file
cabinet because
as you know we were with him before and
do i don't go along the same path as he
does it would be interesting to have
those notes to be able to
to further what we understand about the
black pharaoh in his minions
well since his disappearance we
haven't really
messed with any of his stuff ah
so if they want them to go away would it
be okay if we um
helped you with that we don't want it to
go away
um i thought that's what's the point
that was that you that uh
you didn't think it was a good good idea
so i'd be
more than happy to help you
make them go away
that's not how museums work oh i know
but but i i understand but you were
talking
you were talking about i'm going to jump
in and interrupt just to try and
pull the subject away from this
conversation and and
uh like start having him like walk me
through
the books to try and figure out if any
of the any of them could have history
that's relevant to understanding
uh the black pharaoh or these tunnels
and i'm going to look daggers into the
back of mr holler's dr
hollister's head holly well i mean you
must understand
that unfortunately i i
or fortunately i have not done a great
deal of research
into these materials i um
i assisted dr kafur but yeah
researcher
so where are the notes but but the the
but he has books as well that we're
looking at right
we aren't just looking at his notes
we're looking at there are there's the
inside the little reading room there's
there's there's a shelf
of you know some of the most horrible
things ever written
yeah i'm trying to get him to go through
and explain like overviews of what each
of these are to be like okay
this wouldn't have anything this might
he told me emphatically not to read
well we're we're out of we're out of
options are you aware that dr kapoor was
quite mad
yes and that's why why are you trusting
his judgment
for whether or not we should be these
books
because the books are what made him
quite let me show you sure
let me show you something he takes you
down the hall
to what you know is kefor's office yes
kefor's office you take one step in
and every surface in this place
every wall every piece of paper
every glass every window
every whatever has the word emma written
on it
i'd introduce i didn't introduce myself
he was quite mad and it was those books
that drove him to this
i i can't in good conscience do that to
someone else
and i'm not going to do it to myself
yeah who's this emma person
[Laughter]
i just i i don't i if he
if he was mad i don't know how much we
can trust his judgment for whether or
not
at least each of these books attributed
to that
if someone's crazy they could look at a
book of like fairy tales or nursery
rhymes and
and claim that it's there's some sort of
evil message in it
so we we can't just assume that
everything here that could potentially
have very valuable information to us
was the cause of of his condition
uh i mean even if we're just skimming
and we look through and we're like oh
this is
this is too much we can just close that
book and go on to another one
that is not my impression because dr
kafur never closed the book
ah but so but but but his notes his
notes aren't
aren't the books they are something
um i i mean
so we have had this office locked
from four days after he disappeared
um you're welcome i i
would not i don't know his what state
his notes are in he says looking at
all right i understand i understand you
know that that's okay
are you guys gonna go back to the other
room or well
so you're the only one here who's
willing to read these that speaks arabic
are there any notes that are in english
no i am not willing to read them no no i
was talking to
professor lam we we don't really have
much most of our english books now are
in british museums
most but not all are there so are there
any
is there even is there anything at all
in his library or in those books that
that i can go over because otherwise
joan is going to have to like start
browsing everything to see if it has any
useful information
uh not in not in the the professors
not in the doctor's special collection
while this is all going on and they're
trying to talk i am i'm looking around
looking for
you know even it says emma emma emma off
the top i'm like making sure i can get a
hold
of his things they're saying basically
that they can't they don't know what's
in here so i'm
going to sure you're you're casing the
joint well they distract him that's
61 yes that gets me spot hidden
okay so yeah you find um
a sheaf of notes that seem to be uh
his his writings in arabic
um and it starts out
uh talking about the necronomicon
and how you know this is
he you know almost glibly
like oh the forbidden book
let's see what and then like
by the third you know by the third time
he reads it
he's already like starting to go um
and there's some stuff
uh about
there's some stuff about how he's
studying
rituals that will allow him to travel uh
distances um
and he does point out the book that that
ritual is based on
but it seems like that like he is
got it okay
well i'm going to keep looking for
things and and i i have brought my
backpack with me
um and these are going to go in there
so you recall that the like well
nope you know what they didn't search
you this time things are crazy there's a
there's a potential war going on
yes so i have my notes when you came in
they did not go through your bed
cool so yeah you just shove a bunch of
notes in there
and meanwhile poor ahmed is
you know essentially just
imploring you not to read these books
can i get him to just
read off the titles sure he might he'll
read off the titles
and like everyone yeah that one he'll be
like that sounds awful
that's terrible you should cope
so he reads off the articles that if you
had
any like if you had any cthulhu mythos
at all you would like
your ears would be tingling like emma's
like i've actually heard of that book
but without cthulhu mythos the books
don't mean a whole lot to you
they're just wacky titles but there's
nothing that i can even
okay emma do any of these sound
i don't know do they sound reasonable
they they all say i mean
you you have heard of at least a dozen
of these books
in terms of them being significant
mythos tones
are the is there anything that would be
of interest though
um i mean if you're
not just you know like wearing other
people's skin
yeah does he say the name of the book
that i
i saw for rituals of travel the one that
that you uh
that we have specifically in the notes
yeah yeah
so that one is he translates it
it's it translates curiously from the
aramaic
um some of it is kind of phonetic but
uh this book is called the song of the
dole
all right so ahmed
and looking straight in the eyes and i'm
gonna say
hang out here for a little bit and uh
yeah he he said that he would he just
has to be here while we read through
things
yeah i'm i'm fine i mean we close
and we're going to want to beat out
before it's anywhere close to getting oh
yeah no we're not going to do that so so
but in this room and in the in the
reading room both of those rooms okay
and i i i met a you know
miss you know holly i'm trying to give
him the let's get him out of here so we
can
he's not leaving the room with the books
the office he'll leave
yes okay but but he's not going to leave
the room
right but we're in the office right now
he's in the room with the yeah sure
yeah well he's where
like so if you were able to like case
the office then he's in the book with
the rooms
because got it you thank you thank you
thank you got it
okay yeah understand that what we're
looking for
is to get him away from the so we can
look through the office
yeah okay so when you were casing the
office he went in the book of the room
so he was reading off titles all right
thank you
thank you thank you thank you emma do
you want to amy do you want to hit the
last few bits and then maybe we'll go to
break
yep yep yep okay so hang on a second
that's a lot of things for me to do here
hang on
so before you do that also
um because like i would be looking for
like does joan find any space meat is
really just what i'm asking
no well it looks like the space meat is
missing
although you recall that space need
you can't i don't think luck roll what
have we done luck rules i don't remember
i thought this was like a search maybe i
know there's no search but like
yeah there's not hidden but no this was
a is there
okay anytime you ask if something's
around it's a luck rule
well this is something that we knew yeah
uh but you do recall that the space mead
was involved
probably in some of the of the
transportations
right so that's why we're looking for it
oh his recipe we should find his recipe
yeah joan has his notes
yes okay so brayden five ash gave a
thousand to ezra
so that the next random npc is
australian i don't know how they're
gonna get there but that's fine
oh boy then let's see brayden also
gave 500
um basically to just for a necronomicon
roll
oh very exciting well there you know
he wants somebody's got to steal the
book now no we don't
there's a there's in jones satchel there
the first
chapter of the translated necronomicon
is in there
yeah yep so time to work on chapter two
joan
spacemaid and then
debicy one also gave us 500 bits for
enjoying the stream so thank you very
much there
and i think we're caught up on the bits
all right so again we are giving away
this beautiful set of what is it like
four coasters
yes it is a set of four coasters four
coasters so
all you have to do is hashtag is it set
up
yep it's set up that's what i was doing
while i was asking for jones roll look
at that
so all you have to do is put in chaos
at the break and if the german guy or
braden wins it i'll cover the cost of
shipping
ooh god i hope they don't win now
[Laughter]
uh hashtag chaos of the break to enter
uh
and we will see you as soon as five
people can you six people can use six
bathrooms
all right guys i'm not using the
bathroom
thomas gets to use the bathroom and then
the rest of us each get two
okay
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
thank you hello internet friends here's
the energy
um welcome back um
so we have one we tamagotora gave us
another 500 bits to
in try and incite someone to steal a
book i'm i'm
shocked that such behavior would happen
the first person to steal the book it's
the inspiration is that i am yes
i am genuinely sure that it is taking
bits
of nudging to get someone to steal a
book come on people and now
amy is going to hit the button that
tells us who we're doing this
live normally this happens off-screen
but we are going to do it live and he's
going to hit the button that tells us
who's winning
this fabulous set of well not this one
because this one i think has like
water stains on it but yeah let's see
drum roll
[Music]
elder brown
has one so whisper your uh
uh information to quests and chaos and
we will probably give you the step that
amy is currently hunting
oh that's why that's why people want to
win these
okay okay
life
i i had those markers when i was a kid i
i loved them i had a rainbow nose when i
was a kid
i never stuck them up my nose it was
i mean as a kid wasn't it like you
sniffed the smelly marker and somebody
would do
this so it hit you in the face because
that's what you do when you're five i
was homeschooled i don't understand what
happens in regular school
uh congratulations elder brat yep so
uh when we left uh
we had dr hollister and emma were in the
reading room with Akmala
and professor lam was
scurrying through dr kafur's office
and cleaning stuff up professor lam
oh i just made it 52. all right so
this isn't so much what you hear
you feel like a gust of like not a
gust but you feel like
um almost the feeling of like a ceiling
of a fan
sort of passing across you and then back
with kind of warm air
and you hear a you hear a
a a voice behind you say
okay i think i've already added that
to ezra's pile turn around and you see
this gentleman ah
and you know this man from
uh by reputation
he is dr henry clive he's a member of
the penu foundation
yes he was the leader of the clive
expedition
looks like you're looking for
something here right
well you know the the man had a lot
of things he was looking into
yeah how about you something about
portals or
whatnot yeah what about you what are you
well i'm quite dead yeah
yeah but how is it for you death
i i don't know you know i don't know
what you've heard about death but
it's it's pretty boring
ah oh man
that's too bad you know we've been
taught that you know there's a
greater place to go to
and things like that so no no here's the
secret
life is purposeless and meaningless
that's the secret
didn't it what do you mean how can it be
right look here's the thing i need some
of those books
in that other room but i'm entirely
non-corporeal
so maybe you can help me out well
uh i tell you man i want some of those
books too so
i need to have the book i need to want
to know the book
will there's a book over there
uh you know maybe you've heard of it the
necronomicon
so but i mean i can't just sit there and
flip the pages for you
and stuff real
i mean all right
it's like a show it's like i could just
see like a bunny cobb show where like
he's over joe's shoulder and jones like
shut up i'm flipping the pages
i mean you're actually
so i can read rather quickly right now i
just need to be
alone with the book all right all right
so
um all right so the thing is is that
okay i need to get in that other room
and i'm going to pick up a book so i'll
tell you what
let's can anybody else see you is
it just me
well i i haven't tested it have i
yeah all right well okay this is what
we're going to do say have you ever held
any any staves any like egyptian
staves yeah yeah yeah yeah i had some
for a while but they got taken
ah yeah well you know i've found
that people who've been attuned to that
sort of thing
they you know they can see me more
okay i don't think the other guys have
been attuned to the stage at all since i
had
them sweet all right
here's what we're going to do buddy this
is what we're going to do what i'm going
to do is already made a a
thing with my other friends they're
going to come in here i'm going to go in
the room with the books
i'm going gonna acquire one of the books
and i'll i'll flip the uh
the necronomicon around with you okay
there's no god in the room then
he'll be over here he'll be over hey
we'll make sure he comes over
diversion i'm making a diversion so the
guard
who's watching the necronomicon is gonna
leave
the necronomicon to come to this office
you're in are you in you're in
it it just seems highly unlikely
well do you want to try it or not
why don't we do this instead how about
i make myself invisible you aren't
okay i'm a ghost you might recall i'm
quite dead all right i make myself
invisible
and then i possess
that guard briefly
someone
you get me my book get yourself
something nice as well
bob's your uncle but that means i would
have to take the book out of here
right
no if you give me the book i can read
very quickly
ah got you got you got you okay got you
guys to get you to put the book
in my in my presence gotcha gotcha
gotcha
okay i think we have a plan then but you
know
i thought your plan hinged on a guard
so i'm gonna stay here and if you'll
pardon me if you'll just step out of the
room i'll make myself invisible
yeah i'll go back i'm gonna go into the
other room
all right and you'll know i've possessed
when the god says to you the phrase
how about them apples
all right i can i can go with that how
not something he would normally say very
well all right
on your way then all right i'll go back
in the other room
all right as you leave there's that same
like kind of feeling of wind
behind you do you look back nope
okay so you head into the reading room
yep
all right well um
looking through them just kind of
looking at the books looking at the
stuff and he's there and
all right like
how long are you waiting uh
six minutes because i'm after that i'm
yeah and i'm kind of waiting for joan's
sign to be like get out of here to do
our diversion
i'm just hanging out just being like
when should i go should i go now
yeah so like after five minutes i'm
gonna give her the head thing
all right so she gives you a symbol that
you should
distract the guard okay so um
ahmed can i is it ahmed or is it the
guard
it's ahmed yeah i'm a god he's
do you mind if i actually go look around
the doctor's office
no no go ahead and i can look through
like look in his drawers i just find it
curious that he had that person's name
that person emma as do all over the
place
that's really all you can find in there
is the word emma
written all over okay is it
is a name we weren't sure if it was a
word that we didn't know the meaning of
no it's it's a name it's a it's an
well whoever it is had quite an impact
on him
okay all right i'm gonna just i'm gonna
i mean like straight up search the room
all right so you
head to the office and as you walk to
the door of the office
there is a um
trying to remember if you've ever felt
this feeling there's like a slight
pressure as you walk across the
threshold of the door
i honestly can't remember either yeah i
don't think you've experienced that
before
okay and make me a power roll
oh
and you see this gentleman
with a with a large
sack just shoveling stuff into
a bag and just to clarify out of game
does he
like are his feet touching the ground
does he look normal to me or is he
straight up ago
he seems fully corporeal oh
uh hello i'm doctor henry clive
so you joan has not said anything about
their being
and so i'm just like pardon me
uh i've been sent over here to clean out
dr kapoor's desk
you mean say something collide of the
clive expedition
oh that's me you've heard of me glad to
hear it well
here's the thing though dr kaffor and i
were actually very good friends and he
never said
that somebody who is presumed dead and
lost
should come back and clean his stuff out
oh no no you misunderstand me the museum
has asked me to do this
dr henry clive noted egyptologist
so how long have you where were you
uh i was that did you hear her talking
to anybody yet
yeah remember listen sure you can both
so anyway so i'm just like where have
you been
i mean that is the great mystery you
yeah does anybody need inspiration for
that or no john we inspire that
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna like perk up my
head i'm gonna
walk over because i hear that oh yeah
yeah now i got it all right so yeah you
go here
you both hear emma having a conversation
with someone
all right i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna get
up and i'm gonna because
could someone have gotten through this
is can how is this connected
i'm assuming it's down a hallway yeah
yeah the meeting room is farther down
the hall you're towards the end of a
hallway
the office is earlier in i'm gonna say
also not quiet
hang out here i'm gonna go see what
emma's doing i'll be right back
stay here with you just said my name
to the guard to ahmed
wait who's emma
oh i thought i just called her cause she
um i'm gonna need a roll on that one
well just a roll and i'll tell you the
number well no uh
offer me a persuasion skill okay well i
do have persuasion
well there you that sounds like a fine
offer persuade
okay
yes yes and i'm making sure that
uh no it's not it's not a it's not a
critical one or anything but
uh it's a heavy all right he's like a
little quizzical but
he you know you were like oh got him on
the brain
yeah yep yep yep i saw him everywhere in
there yeah yeah
that is why you shouldn't read these
things
and then you head out yeah all right so
you get to the door you clearly hear
the voice of dr henry clive uh
from beyond the grave and when you
get to the door
are you just going to go in yes okay
yes okay you you pass through there's
again that feeling of a little bit of
pepper
he says well well this is awkward
yes it is i thought you were going as
well leaving two
yeah i actually left before as soon
as i had the listen check it out
all right so Akmala locks the thing up
then he says i guess
well i don't want to sit in there with
those books so he locks the reading room
and he's going to start walking down the
hall can you can you wait outside
we'll be
right back which one of us works at this
museum
okay well we'll come and get you no
what what i'm supposed to fall you
are the people that i am supposed to
okay so you're gonna follow
us yes oh i thought okay all right then
i'm sorry i was confused so as soon as
joan and dr hollister come through
are you going through the door dr
oh no all right so as hollister steps
through the door this will keep
ahmed from following you i'm gonna
get a sand roll for him
oh wow oh nine good job i'm in
um so as dr hollister like crosses the
threshold
the door like honeycombs and there's
almost like
a a web of weird
red energy in the doorway and you find
yourself stuck
uh in the stepping through his doorway
and um
dr cliver right sorry about that
uh look i might not have been
100 honest with you yeah
that's what it sounds like climb
um you know begging your pardon
yeah i i needed an excuse to get you out
of this room so that i could collect
dr cafue's writings
i snatched the bag from him i'm just
like you weren't his friend
no do you start to reach for him you
start to meet her and he says uh
so as you start to reach uh
you speak latin he says something with
the word
tempus in it okay so something about
time
and time like
you s you freeze and it seems
as if dr clive is moving
super fast as he just like he says
ah funny thing about all these doctor
doctor cafe is working very closely with
am i still stuck yes
uh and what what do i say
a fold up chair nearby
there's a very nice make a luck
roll
because if there is i'm gonna push it
yeah i made my luck roll
all right yeah you find standing in the
corner so um
clive has zipped out into the hall
you're all he's moving
you know it's clear that none of you are
math people but
you know five times faster than the rest
all right so i'm like strong yeah you
guys start to like run
the and he is
he is motoring towards the exit of the
thing so
we'll go to initiatives so
i'll mult let's see he's going to get so
on a
on a 400 uh
clive will zip forward
uh 80s
i i i'm not even gonna chase after him
because
i just saw him go fit and it's like yeah
i'm trying to chase a ghost around
right so i'm gonna see if there's
anything left in here i'm just gonna i'm
gonna keep going in the room
all right i'm heading down you notice
you notice that
Akmala is just like staring at all of
this a gate
just like super freaked out yep yep
welcome to our world
all right so 60s 50s
emma's yep so i'm going to continue to
chase
i mean to me he's a person right and
he's
he's a magician at this point in my
world so um
i'm gonna continue to chase him and yell
at him if you don't mind
magician's a little pejorative if you're
gonna run
don't make fun of me just run don't
so i'm gonna continue to chase after him
and scream for a mod and security
all right that man has stolen dr
caffor's
property and there's nothing i can like
throw at him or uh
because being an aussie i'm having an
amazing idea with a boomerang in his
legs
uh make me a luck roll oh boy i don't
even know what my luck is anymore
it's a spat on your character sheet yeah
yeah i don't even know what my luck is
it's
not a great nope i didn't make it uh
sadly there are no boomerangs at hand
but you know what i mean like something
like that folding chair if it was near
me i would just wing it at him
sure make me a throw roll you pick some
you pick up like a garbage can and throw
it there you go
there you go there you go chair so that
is there if you want to use it
they're incredible i like the garbage
can i like the garbage can over his head
go
do it do it okay
you're not gonna you don't you're not
gonna want a boomerang for that you're
gonna you're
you're gonna want a bowler like to trip
him up or something yeah
yes nope i miss it do i want to try it
again do it again do it do it do it do
it
sure because you know getting it
using all this inspiration to get press
the brotherhood who cares but throwing a
garbage can at a ghost
yes damn it no
i want you to use it now instead of when
you're making dodge rolls against
machine guns
yeah nope so i still miss it so there's
garbage everywhere
he so once again like he is just
moving so quickly that it's like he
can watch
he just sort of watches the garbage can
go by
he says on on a on a 400 before he
disappears upstairs
uh wait hey there's there's me oh sorry
you're slower than emma
yeah wait what's that what's your
i'm at a 40. there's my desk 35.
oh my all right hollister yeah i'm going
to pull out a gun and
shoot him it's down the hallway right
sure yeah take it
all right and i i i totally want to
start singing
if i need to can i use inspiration
please yes
because it's the best use ever shooting
all right good that is a hard success
all right so it's amazing damage
it's amazing how easy it is to get a
critical success when your dodge is 300.
uh so he
like not that you know what the
matrix is but he like matrixes the
bullet
someone should make a movie based off of
what i just saw
entirely around it that was highly
traumatic
um so he will
um
uh he will as he pops upstairs he'll
just say
am i still am i was i when i was slow
motion was i slow motion compared to
everybody else or was just to him
just to him he was regular motion
yeah okay and so i'm going to keep or
i'm going to keep running
all right so so
wow a mod is doing a great job somehow a
mod holds it together even though you've
now fired a gun right next to him
uh but he's like the first thing you
just start accepting
don't shoot why are you shooting he's
getting away
aren't you the guard i keep running i'm
doctor client pop sex down i do as well
the only one who doesn't is the only one
who doesn't is emma
all right so you will zip you will
run up entering the lobby of the
british muse
of the the egyptian museum with a
handgun will cause a bit of a stir
um so make me do
make me a skeletal a what role
stealth role stealth oh yeah i failed
that do we want to no we don't want
to inspire that
i you know what and it wouldn't make
sense i wouldn't make that role to begin
with
i don't look at that how fast that guy's
going
i don't have time to like be
what is it subtle
[Laughter]
i'm like screaming did anyone see where
that man went
so many songs um
so yeah you you come on
how are you doing i need a handgun um
people start to like some people notice
you have a gun and start to freak out
nick
well it wasn't a
uh it wasn't a fumble
do i want to reroll that to continue
chasing this
gun do it do it do it yes probably not
gonna make it but i think it's a good
use
so which is which is an emma and which
is an amy
an emma is if you fumble an amy you just
roll worse
yeah ninety-nine what about
oh oh i see someone who's trying to run
just because i have the gun and i think
it's him and i think he's slowed down
that exactly that's where i was going
yeah all i know
he changed exactly so are you are you
you're are you gonna shoot first are you
gonna tackle what are you gonna
are they moving at regular speed yes
oh i'm no i'm just gonna go up and
tackle them all right so yeah i'm
screaming come back here you
shapeshifter
you like you just like football tackle
this guy
this poor person from behind and they
just buckle and they're like
um and you hammered this poor uh
visiting professor down to the ground
uh and he's like i beg your pardon sir
so so joan and emma you come
you make it up to the lobby and
hollister is like
um straddling some guy with his
with his like holding him up by his neck
with his gun
just like brandishing the gun at him and
you both see
like four security guards are coming
towards this scene
oh god all right um
shoot we can't let holly get get
busted um
can we dude i
know i gotta i gotta gotta i'm gonna try
to get him out of this all right
dude come on put it up this is the way
this is not him
huh yeah so so
holly holly put the gun away this on him
he's got away i got him
no it's not him no he's just
saying look he is the bag so
i run up on this and tackle hollister
all right so yeah i'm not a tackling the
security guards are are
clearly aware that they do not have guns
uh they have you know little truncheons
and so
they are very cautiously approaching
just saying like
all right all of you stop stop
so i grab the gun is it do i have to
like do an oppose against an oscar do
you want well okay yeah well actually
uh hollister make me a uh
ah do i take the zero seven or the zero
seven i think you're taking the zero
seven so when emma knocks you to the
ground
you like held on to like there was a
brief second where the like the contact
with the floor
might have knocked the lodge the
gun loose but no you have
held on to the gun and now it's just fun
around my founder when i caught it
uh and with an 07 you manage not to
shoot it
uh as you are tackled as well he's on
the ground though right
yeah you've tackled him to the ground
are you possessed
no i jump up and put my foot on him and
just be like i got it i got it i like
pull out
some random like thing out of my wallet
and i'm like i got him everybody it's
okay
it's okay i got him it's all under
control now
uh investigator joan if you could uh
disarm this man we've got it under
control everybody no need to panic i
give me the gun holly now
give it to me i have to think that
they're authentic i mean they are acting
pretty weird
so they are probably yeah i think it's
it seemed this seems very much like them
uh the security guards have basically
like the
the lobby has empty everyone has fled
this place
there are four security guards who are
like very cautiously
like slowly approaching there's a a
poor professor who is just staying on
the ground like
clutching his clutching his attache
to his chest
uh
it's not a sack it's a attache case this
is not him
come on he put he he changed his form
no i could swear i saw it you have to
believe me
the things you've seen dude we've got to
get out of here those those guys are
going to get you he's going to get away
he's gone already he's right
there just check the bag can i can i
punch him
hold on a punch yeah sure
uh make me a fight brawl would you like
to dodge this dr hollister
uh sure i mean now wait hold on is this
a slap some sense or is this a
i want to knock you out this
this is i want to knock you out because
then we can take him okay
so hollister you you should make a dodge
i did not have party conflict down in
this uh
all right so i made let's see my
fight brawl is 60 i made 47
it's not hard it's just regular yeah so
you're gonna do a d3
yeah it's a one i just all right oh
why why aren't you why would you just
just check his bag
so essentially the professor is getting
up and like walking towards the security
guards
and so i go to intervene and i'm like
brushing him off being like i'm so sorry
sir
we've got this under control now i do
i well i'm i should say i
i hope you do what what the hell just
happened there the gentleman thought
that he was uh
that you were taking the valuable items
from the from the establishment in
your attache case but clearly you have
not sir clearly we understand that you
have not taken anything
and you have barely just entered this
establishment and so
yeah go to the security guards and be
like
gentlemen gentlemen you have doing it
you have done an excellent job if you
could escort this gentleman
perhaps to wherever he needs to be and
take extra good care of him
uh one of the security i'm gonna make
you an offer
okay you can try and make a roll on this
of some persuasion skill and they will
all go
or you can go with the awesome
role play and most of them will go but
based on what i want world
at least one of them is going to be like
okay so i you know
what other roles besides persuasion is
persuasion
oh fast talk's a good one too all right
which i have none of these things i
the other emma should have been here the
other emma would have this old
yeah well you've got two options though
are they both at rock bottom
yeah they're both at rock bottom then
choose the one that you
want to have a chance at skilling up
no but i heard the words make you an
offer what was the offer again oh the
offer was
if you make the roll then success
all of the police all of the security's
like well okay i don't know what's going
on here
otherwise based on what i rolled one of
them is gonna hang around being like
there's a guy with a gun
oh okay so i should just roll for shits
and giggles anyway right
well i mean i mean there's the fumble
aspect but
there there's there certainly is when
would a fumble possibly go wrong
[Laughter]
right now how about
didn't make it but it's not a fumble i
got a 23 and i have no persuade so
obviously i didn't make it but good luck
you could spend luck
no no that's all right i barely have
brushing the man off and being like
gentlemen you've done an excellent job
here we've we've clearly got this under
control
you should assist this fine gentleman to
where he is where he was i'm sorry where
were you headed again
i was going to study in the reading room
um excellent choice what were you scared
what were you going to study you clearly
look like a man of high education and
esteem
i i i was going to to i was looking for
ah right the cat lady
believe me no i'm just gonna grab
your your shirt man holly you i'm
grabbing your shirt and i'm like dude we
gotta get out of here
security guards are staying with you and
two are going towards the
uh dr hollis and the dr hollister one
of them will say
sir i need you to put the gun down give
it to me give it to me
i did not say give it to her i said put
the gun down
sir
we think our friend ahmed can clear this
up if you will just uh
um at this point ahmed will come up the
stairs
and you still he sees you you still have
the gun drawn
why do you still have a gun out why are
you shooting
in the egyptian museum you saw him he
i didn't i'm not going to shoot anyone
because you don't have a gun
so ahmed please ahmed tell these guys
that that that there was somebody trying
to steal
stuff from the and he got away this
helmet was a misunderstanding
tell him yes there was someone here
downstairs who tried to steal things
from doc who stole
things from dr kapoor's office um
that's 18 yeah okay um
they're not gonna search your bag uh
and and he he he fled uh
and these people shot at him why did you
bring a gun to our museum
uh egypt is a very dangerous place right
now
because people are bringing guns
everywhere
well i was talking more about the
you saw how fast he moved right and he
referred to himself he referred to
himself as being a wizard
our our doctor here was very very very
upset
about things being stolen and that's why
he went
to all these measures all these measures
to try to catch the guy but now that we
have
got him the guy left i'm really sorry
but now we've got everything all under
control right now
we're good thank you thank you
appreciate it would you remove these
people from the museum please
and Akmala will turn and walk down the
stairs i'm gonna go try to follow him
uh one of the security guards will go
ma'am i need you to stay here
but i i have the assistant curator has
please put the gun away sir oh yeah i
uh so they're gonna escort you out of
the museum
as i'm getting escorted out i yell back
at the professor
i met her followers call me if you want
to talk about it
[Laughter]
i'm at the us military base
now we can't go back to the us military
base
it's just we need to back up military
base now because of you we have backup
we can't go back to that base now
we can't go there you just announce to
everyone
dude oh man why do i hang out with these
people
[Music]
we have to go what was the name of the
look holly or look doctor i wasn't the
one who pulled a gun in front of
everybody come running like a lunatic
and tackle some poor professor who's not
yeah i have but it doesn't mean that
this time he like was also speed
lightning
and shape-shifting i mean that's not
that i know a lot about wizards
but that's the class a lot of two things
and now you guys have made it so i
can't get the book that we needed
he started it well wait
he started it how far away are we from
people at this point during this
conversation
uh you are walking to a park you're in a
park
yeah we're outside because they kicked
us out then i'm gonna say
we needed that book man well i got i got
i got some notes what what what would we
do with that book
what do you need that book for do you
what
what clive did to move well enough with
clive did clive was a ghost
guys that's why he can move yeah
yeah no move oh he's a ghost and
you mean sorry
you mean do what could four did you're
doing the
the trying to do
rituals for travel i was trying to get
that book
song of the dawn i can tell you that
that
uh that would be very much in the
interest
of the us government
and yeah i would definitely support
you
so i don't think clive's a ghost i mean
he's not a ghost joan just said he's a
ghost and a wizard
why wouldn't he move you have to run at
super speed and exactly my point
he's not a ghost he's alive you can't be
a ghost in a wizard
no he's alive we saw him alive yep
he's staying somewhere we got to find
him i don't know why
oh sure you know what he said see you at
giza
yeah he's gonna go out there and he's
trying to deal with the pyramids too
but maybe not in the same way so
so you guys did it was clear you heard
that the clive expedition was
massacred but then we saw a living
wizard yeah henry clive
no we saw what's his name in shanghai
brady yeah
so brady's alive he was not part of the
sorry
so yeah no there's a different
expedition expedition
what is was still in egypt to this day
they were a second expedition that had
the we're gonna have to somehow now
at night it's very dangerous but
we would want to get
alexandria and donald to get us in there
yeah you think you have all the answers
now dr hollister don't you
okay so you're disagreeing we don't want
to do that
i know i'm just mad at you man you just
screwed everything up you and you i
saw him shape-shift did we know that do
you think a gun would have helped
well if i'd hit him yes
he was going just so fast do you think a
gun
you think a bullet would have been able
to hit him yeah yes
or i wouldn't have tried it yeah yeah
yeah
what okay so here's another question
who's going to explain this to everybody
[Laughter]
because i have a fantastic way of
missing details
so that it seems like we didn't do
anything wrong um
huh so you're volunteering let me think
let me think on it for a minute hold on
i'm hearing the popeye theme music
uh-huh
well some things you can't spin should
we go look into that
letter of recommendation while we're on
the topic
of i think i might stop and need a drink
before i go see the nuns
i'm there i need a stiff drink
well let's let's mess up the country
wait what i said i have some bad news
about arabic countries
yeah yeah can't we go to the ritz and
get a drink
yeah sure well if we need to rent out a
room or two there now so
there we go and we definitely have to
let's let's meet up with alexandria and
donald as soon as possible to let them
know we can't go
back to the military base and we can't
go back
we can't go back anywhere well we we can
go back there but we can't stay there
what no
no we can stay there all right so you
guys all meet up for lunch
yeah after a very fun eventful mornings
i'm just gonna look at the three of them
and go you have the three stooges look
what happened no it's more like those
monkeys
[Laughter]
well how did how did and then i do
this on his mouth
things went fine with mr wasif i think
we're going to be able to get a contact
or two in the state department to help
us get some more allies
what happened with you three okay so let
me tell you what happened
but what is it lunch time now so you're
kicked out right library
yeah no no no no no no we're kicked out
of the museum
but it was live's fault okay so
five of the clients yes dr henry clive
showed up
at the museum i thought he was dead
yeah well but then he asked me to help
him
he will he wanted the necronomicon i
wanted some other stuff i was looking
through
yes and so when i went to go look at the
other books
he started putting everything from the
the
the the the office into his sack
stuff that i wanted and then he ran away
like dr kapoor's office yes
and so we got kicked out i feel like
there's a few steps missing in there
yeah oh yeah yeah yada yada we got
kicked out
[Laughter]
any information about the tunnels or or
the history no
no because holly had to get his gun out
we weren't going to mention that part we
were getting a yadda yadda yadda pass
the details no i'm done with yada yada
i am done with yada yada
yeah yeah yeah yeah okay
well at least i tried something
i was doing something and you doing
something you were being
duped by him he had no intention of
helping you your plan was completely it
i'm just sitting there watching yeah
and also and also i'm watching this like
it's a tennis match just like
i had another plan to be able to get the
book we needed
and it didn't matter if he got away we
needed that book
what and now we can't get it what book
song of the door
what the talks about rituals for
travel rituals
for travel don't we already have
something like that hollister isn't that
what your research is based on
what well we need we need the spell we
don't have the we don't have the
the part of it that actually does the
spell you know why did you
not have that when you had the the the
portal thing that got us everywhere
because they had kapoor before or wasn't
really in a state to write things down
yeah he he was not terribly responsive
so we need that book to get around the
world faster
is that what i'm hearing yes yes and
and if we need resources from the
military base i can
help procure what are you what are you
we're not storming any museum
i'm just you already tried that and you
failed
all right you two stop
i understand i understand he's being a
prick but both of you need to stop
because this isn't helping
what do we need to do at this point here
people what have we discovered what
well clive and all the paperwork are at
the pyramid of giza
that's all i know he said i don't think
it is
is that where that horrible massacre
took place though with the monsters
be close yeah is well and even beside
any of that is giza somewhere that we
can
go with everything going on in the
country
i mean it's relatively close to cairo
it's probably
it's probably close but it is probably
close to the front of whatever is going
on
like in the 20s because like right now
the city
pretty much goes to the pyramids like in
the 20s is it
outside of town actually there was a
there was a tourist
train that went giza in the 20s i wonder
if the train is still running
option one has got a gaza and what what
what deal with clive that's option one
option two is go steal a book from a
museum
one of those a little easier than the
other i like glance over at donnell
which one stealing a book is not a
problem
stealing a book from a museum is fairly
uh relatively easy i guess it depends on
whether or not there's a
 ghost in the building
it wasn't a ghost he he was a
a speeding shifting wizard
wait a minute are you talking about
you wouldn't know was it was it like
in the dreamlands
when we were on different times not you
hollister the other two
yeah not really because he was just
moving faster than
sight so like he would pop upstairs and
then we called him something and he was
angry about it what do we call him like
a warlock i forgot what we called him
and then he pops back downstairs and
says i'm a wizard and then pops back
that's i mean well that sounds a lot
like the dreamlands
it is very yeah it was it sounds like a
very similar concept
moving at a different time than the rest
of you yeah
yeah i wonder if he has the recipe for
space mead and we are not doing any god
damn speech in space need
i don't remember and everybody in the
office would remember that he
he said in a super accelerated voice
that cofour was doing some very
interesting studies in time
yes yeah i wonder where i got that
information from
i'm stealing at attica ford's office i
wonder
well here's here's the question did
clive
know kefur before we interfered with his
life
i mean it makes sense that they would
know each other i mean we went there why
wouldn't the club expedition go
because they're arrogant british people
yeah
yeah australian actually
seemed like i would not have pegged an
australian for leading that that
expedition fair numb
[Music]
well that's small-minded yeah i'm not
seeing literally pop into her i wasn't
well-minded i just know what the 20s
were like
especially with australians yeah
so what do you want to do i want the
book
right well
it isn't like we haven't cased the place
before yeah well
and i will tell them over dinner that i
did get some
of the the the writings but
not as many as i would like to have had
i don't imagine that a partial writing
is going to do us anything
good well maybe maybe
it depends on what we're able to fit
into what we already know
i mean john has studied a lot of this
stuff if she's able to
look at his even partial notes and put
it into the context of things that she
knows and what hollister has studied
exactly
maybe we'll be able to put some more
right so the the question of the hour
do you want me or us
to sneak in and get the damn book yes
yes
oh shush what
draw the diagram about museum detail
every detail
both floors yeah they'll give you
they'll give you uh
the downstairs joan knows the
downstairs very well
yes donald you know the downstairs
pretty well yeah yeah
i mean you're you're better with locks
than i am dear
i love dogs been there before though i
thought you went
uh the second time yeah for the second
time yeah
right yeah there's there's four guards
there might be more at night they don't
have guns
no but ahmed has a key so i don't
know if it's on him or in his office
to the room that specifically we're
looking for as as long as we're able to
have some
uh quality time alone with the door
donald can get us in
would probably have some ether would i
yeah it was a fairly common so the
ether would be useful
okay this is the 20s you've got morphine
you've got cocaine
all right that's what this party needs
yeah i was gonna say joan might like you
the drugs start flowing right well oh
their
decision making will only improve we
should
all coked up at giza
we're we're going to be talking some
more to um
wasif tomorrow that's the plan and i'll
like
glance around and make sure that we are
very alone before leaning in to the
other three who didn't hear this and say
he's a kings man he's
an english spy in egypt so
if there's any way that we can leverage
that
that might be useful i didn't ask about
a riverboat goodness down there i was
hoping you'd find out more about these
tunnels but
oh actually we did what did you find
joan do you want to tell him about the
worms
right um
[Laughter]
i beg your pardon is this a lunch
conversation
yes yes yes
yes the black pharaoh had there was
there was reference to minions
that could create tunnels and fill them
in quickly so
um basically worms can bore quickly and
they can
fill it up quickly with what they've
ingested
i would like to have as little to do
with worms as physically possible
agreed that's why i was trying to get
all right this is the only book you need
from this library is that correct
yes yeah be careful though because dr
clive was talking about trying to get
the
the necronomicon is in there don't don't
touch it don't go near it
just the song of the dhole we are not
touching
any necronomicon that drove yosef insane
and unlock the door behind you when you
leave
maybe so emma had announced that we
were
staying at the military base so we've
rented out rooms at the ritz
i'll be staying at the military base a
little more secure there since there's a
i mean i just announced it to this
kindly old professor who was studying
bahat is that how you say it
well and anyone else in earshot because
you were shouting it are we worried well
there was nobody else because you
cleared the place out with a gun
welcome children
are we in danger at the military base
from a professor coming to kill us
i don't think so unless of course he's a
wizard
when magic's involved exactly yeah so
so the hotel is going to be better if
they don't know that we're there yes
oh yeah they're going to find us don't
if they have magic they can find us
i mean the ritz is the assumption that
i i vote for going back to the military
base and
there's lots of guns there i'm not
afraid of that fat little wizard
[Laughter]
oh gods are these two going to be
sniping at each other the rest of
eternity
fair at least until next year
 all right i agree i think that
the military
base may be the most secure location
if the wizard fellow shows up he'll try
to show up anywhere that we are
yep and we got lots of things to do
that said though a a australian
australian you said showing up
at an american base that might be
interesting
hey man we remember gallipoli we salute
our australian
the you know our fine australian allies
fair enough
all right so it is it is
at the afternoon of may 29th
uh are you gonna do anything in the
afternoon before
uh breaking and entering do we go to
saint
mothers of benedictine or whatever i
mean we're not it's not
the disease of saint catherine whatever
it's not like we're going to have good
ideas for this tomorrow
we might we might as well go and try to
get some some support there
i'd be willing to go over there with you
we just got raided welcome high shelf
thanks for thanks for joining us very
exciting we're
we're playing call of cthulhu and you
just missed our first inner party
conflict
seriously i'm seriously about to smack
professor heads together
uh all right so you head to
uh and you are introduced to uh
uh father father uh
it's a pleasure to meet you
yes welcome
uh
are you are you children of the faith
yes father and i produce a letter
it's it's been a long journey if you
sit and listen and with open ears and an
open heart
and i give a minute to read the letter
that never ends well
he looks up sister as you know only too
well
listening is
listening is part and parcel of our
faith
i forgive you thank you
i appreciate that now what have you done
well a lot of things but it's my
confession sister i think last week
actually i had the opportunity to
confess in the vatican itself it was
quite
an experience that that is
a pilgrimage well
then you you are you are how
what can i do for you sister um
we're here to ask a somewhat unusual
request
okay so he's still listening he's not
myself and a few others in the vatican
interesting sort of arcane
relics things of that nature we feel
that
the path of christianity and the lord's
ways the right way
and so it is our mission to not only
explore some of these issues but
potentially
is he still with me i see yes okay
um mister you you seem to be speaking
around something because it's a very
difficult ask
um we understand is there and i kind of
look around is there anybody else in
here uh
any only who whoever with of the great
gang society
okay we've come to believe
that the brotherhood i just i
keep calling on the brotherhood it's
about brotherhood of the pharaoh right
rather than black pharaoh
yeah the brotherhood of the black
pharaoh is um
is essentially trying to dominate the
world
ancient methods if you will they are
directly in league with satan
okay let's not be a little dramatic it's
pretty accurate though
no it's it's the
is it inaccurate yeah i think he's
pretty active in advance
i mean satan satan not necessarily um
they're basically what they're doing is
their worship worshiping a demigod
they are breaking that first rule where
they are
put worshipping and
enveloping more people in the
countryside in order to worship this
false god
that goes by the black pharaoh and from
what we've done the research on the
black pharaoh
is an ancient and at one time was
in power in egypt and so they are
bringing this cult back
and so we have the means in the method
in order to stop this cult
and to basically cap their source of
power
but it requires some
old testament biblical means in order to
well it sounds like you are
following the lord's path well but
here's where
the conflict comes in when i say old
not of life yeah exactly i grab his arm
and i'm like not that dramatic again
and i look at doctor and i'm just like
again not that dramatic
no i said i i was saying it's not that's
that i was confirming
yeah i mean all
all all worthy efforts require sacrifice
but this one doesn't require the death
or the burning of anything
it just requires blood of innocence
but not necessarily their death just you
know
just like as if you were at the at the
doctor's office and you had to give
blood
but it requires innocence and because we
are
so close to the source that i was coming
to you because obviously your flock
must be some of the purest in the
country and so therefore i came to you
in order to acquiesce or at least assist
in
providing some of the innocent
individuals
sister you should know as well as anyone
that none of us are innocent
we are all creatures of sin well we we
need
so so the ritual that we found speaks to
the people being willing to stand
against evil
if that helps clarify i see i see
and this ritual
discussing
there's an uncomfortable silence
[Laughter]
it's been it's been sanctioned by the
vatican
well i i mean if given your
your your you know this letter asks me
to give you any
when a cardinal asks me
to give you any assistance that i might
then of course
blood you say correct and so
we've you know and again it may sound a
little bit morbid but in order to do no
harm
to the individuals who would be
assisting us we would pre procure the
procure the blood from approximately
13ish individuals in order to perform
this
and so therefore it wouldn't be enough
in order to harm the individual that's
why we're asking for so many volunteers
oh i'll pick up my medicine bag and show
that i have
like it would all be done in a very
civilized controlled way as to not cause
harm
as we're like in the middle of like
cultists
and and with these is there any danger
to the people is this
what i mean would this ritual have any
cost
to them the cost would the cost would
come to us it would just be a blood cost
to those individuals and i think the
only danger would be
um the fact that we are fighting pure
evil we are fighting the brotherhood
um they are out there and they are out
there to do harm and to bring about
you know the ancient evils of ancient
times
and so in that you do take risk and
marching out into the desert with us
not even close in there nope but i like
that you and
you invoked that i
i will do whatever you
i cannot put my flock in danger like
that
i understand and we are working on
securing transportation
um and safe passage you know not only
for your flock but also for ourselves we
as well do not want to you know march
brazenly into the uh
into the desert being outnumbered
against this this evil army
and so therefore you know we do have to
um it is required that we do this on
out in the desert yes it takes place
at the the red pyramid outside of
up and then yes correct
i i see so we would need to leave
cairo and go to da
shore that is not a safe journey
potentially
although i mean many people do it the um
the the the newspapers say that the
brotherhood of black pharaoh is not
uh ending commerce so there are still
barges
this this sounds extraordinarily
dangerous
it's i'm not saying that it is without
danger you know
to live the righteous life is to live a
dangerous life
well i will make you this promise i
pledge myself to whatever
you need done i will allow you
that's the day tomorrow yeah yeah yeah
that's in two days
i will i will ask them to help you
um you should
consider you should consider how you
approach
innocent people with this ask
but but i will i will
but i i cannot speak for my flock i will
allow you to speak to them
and if they are moved and if the spirit
is in them and if
the lord is willing they will join you
all right and i thank you thank you so
much father of course
i will leave you and i will return on
sunday what's the vatican like
it smells wonderful it smells like
it is it is very hard being
i understand stay strong thank you and
you as well
sister thank you peace be unto you
exactly i kneel i genuflect on the way
out the door spinning
i'm out yeah and alexandria kind of
automatically says and also with you and
looks very embarrassed to have said it
yeah especially because you're probably
protestant no she was raised catholic
oh wow yeah irish catholic surprise
surprise
uh it's all huey miracle sauce i
mean
[Laughter]
so yeah you guys leave uh
and unless you're gonna do anything else
we will zip ahead to
a a heist in the museum
so anybody else going besides alexander
and donald
no it wouldn't be wise
all right um
so yeah you guys find a an
open window that gets you in the museum
very easily
uh it's a little bit of work to get down
to the basement
but you both make it both of you make
me stealth rolls
i just need one success between this is
literally the first roll i've had to
make
all day all right there's the one
success all right
yeah you are the knight you easily
avoid
the poor night watchman who's just
walking through halls with a
flashlight it appears
like there is no one uh
there are no guards downstairs so you
remember that kefur's
uh thing was in the sub basement so it
was two
uh floors down and uh
on the you go down the stairs
it's an open stairway so you come out on
the
uh basement floor and
uh you know there's there's nothing
there it's dark
and then you go back down and you take
the left
to go down the hallway basically you go
all the way down a hallway and then you
take a right
and that's the hallway where kefur's
office is and the reading room is
o2 41 hard success all right
uh well an o2 also so both of you
clearly hear
some sort of commotion coming in the
direction that you were gonna head
all right wait silence listen
careful patient all right let's get a
little bit closer as listening just
trying to be like
if something's about to explode i want
to be nearby
no it's it's a it's a noise you don't
recognize
um
uh yeah you you well you got an o2 so
donald you hear
um you hear
uh a voice say um
agatha is that the book you were looking
for
australian accent dr clive australian
yes
and you keep hearing this weird noise
that almost
it sounds like someone hiccuping on like
in the name of the gods all right i'll
follow you in let's go see that take a
look
and draw a dagger all right let's see
what's up with us
all right so you turn the corner
um you are the knight
and they rolled a 99 so oh good
uh so there is a blue light
coming out of that room on the left that
is
the the reading room
and you see that the cage is open the
door
that went to the reading room is open
they're stealing the books they want
all right and you
um you hear a voice a woman's voice say
i want to get up as close as possible
and like peak around the corner without
going all the way into the doorway
just to see what what are we dealing
with all right so
um in the room is
uh professor clive
um also in the room is
i didn't print this one out so let's see
if this will work
hey that kind of works a woman wearing a
ridiculous hat
an older woman wearing a ridiculous hat
um probably who was referred to as
agatha
uh and then the reason that you're gonna
make sand rolls because
also in the room sitting at the reading
room table
is Akmala and there is some sort of
um crystalline spider
who's whose arms
are like all over his head and he's just
so both of you make me sad i don't know
if i was actually looking though
i was 30. with my brand new shiny sanity
and that's what you see
i'm like pulled back around the corner
just white as a sheet
just
some sort of crystal spider around a
fellow's head
and he looks like he's in a lot of pain
many of them in there three uh
both of you make me stealth rolls as you
are having a whispered conversation
yeah regular success regular success
okay
uh
[Music]
make me make me listen rolls goddammit
i didn't make rolls all night now all of
a sudden yeah 48
regular success 4 44 regular success uh
huh i don't know how i feel about this
but i'm going to tell you that you need
a hard success
so you can use inspire i'm going to let
you guys use inspiration
definitely on time the fine people that
watch this program want you to have this
second chance
that's fair all right so you need a hard
success all right
let's leave inspiration
all right 94. not a hard success
all right so donald is utterly surprised
alexandra is not surprised at all um
alexander right before things go to hell
and you see a very familiar
no you see a
spider that's like an ah it's you see an
eyeball with spiders legs
yep no oh
from new york from new york and
alexandra because you saw it and donald
hasn't make me a sanity roll
yeah all right you lose another one
sanity
um and we are in initiatives
like as i'm turning i'm going to slap my
my hand against donald trump like point
okay so that'll be your initiative
so well i i go after him but i but i
wasn't surprised by it
yeah so on a
you hear a mod go uh
they're here
all right so initiative wise dog goes
first is he aware of the spider or
what is your initiative it's 80. yes
you go
first you are not so you are not aware
of the spider yet
you did not make the listen roll you
just have noticed
all right so he heard they're here so
yeah you clearly hear you clearly hear a
mods voice say they're here
all right so donald's gonna burst
into the room then
they know we're here elementary surprise
is gone he's all right
so they taught i his fan the spider
delving through a mod's mind and i
failed by sandy roll
all right we'll inspire that i'll
inspire that
if you need it we got it i'll take her
you got it man
um and you would swear
that part of the like these things arms
are like going through his head
and like pulling out weird like brain
webs and things and there's a whole it's
it's it's awful Akmala's eyes are wide
open
looking at nothing so
you see clive and
this woman agatha uh
and they don't seem that surprised
right and
uh and you see the guy with the you
see a mod
and the spider and the brain spider
though i'm gonna target
um clive so dart into the room uh
gun and both hands right snap shot right
clyde
so you're just gonna okay this will
end the stealth portion of this uh
journey absolutely
the gunshot goes off in the basement of
the hotel absolutely
okay take your shot all right 34
which is a hard success
um and so clive
almost like he knows what you were gonna
do just
moves and he looks at agatha and he says
just like you said they would oh sorry
it's just like you said they would i no
that was terrible that was cockney
again you were using some cockney turns
a phrase earlier cause i think it's fair
just like you said they would there we
go all right um
and agatha like is sort of just not
really reactive she's just
kind of normal in fact she looks a
little sad
when you look at her um
and all right that was 80s 70s
do i i'm that's me do i see
the spider thing that i heard
yeah you saw the spider with the eye you
made already made a sand roll for it
cool
where is it is it within reach of me uh
what's your size
i am 60. make a size roll
okay first time ever had to make a size
roll oh wait that's a critical success
all right so yeah you think if you jump
you can like stab up on the roof
then i will jump and stab up at the roof
okay
don't fumble oh gee that is a critical
success
all right yeah you do double you do
four and three plus
nine nine points of damage ouch you take
a big
chunk out of out of the eye uh
of this thing and it clearly did not
enjoy that and you hear
um you hear a mod
inside go ow like with this a tonal sort
of
thing all right also on a 70 it
will go
and it will oh you should make a dodge
roll
i will do so if you recall this thing
has like weird
i remember legs i have no pleasant
memories of this
12 critical success wow
okay tie goes to the player because
it got a critical success as well so you
you have dodged what would have been a
double damage blow
ah i'm glad i missed i'm glad i got that
one
uh that was 70s
on a 60 clive
uh will um
clyde will say something to the to the
apparently to the spider thing
in a language that you have never heard
before
and only donald only you can see this
the spider will um
it's on his head all of a sudden it
floats up this way
i'm trying to remember the word whatever
that word is for like doors that kind of
irises irises there you go it irises
and there is now a um
some sort of weird doorway and at the
top of it
is the body of that spider that brain
spider
uh and uh
um clive will doff his cap to you
and step through that portal
that was 60s 50s oh wait you guys have
both gone
uh and then we're back to the top
and that is you
the the spider's body is still there
above the doorway right yep
and the doorway still exists the doorway
still exists
all right where's alexandria behind you
stabbing something i'll turn and see
what she's stabbing
awesome so you flip around with your gun
and you look up on the roof and you see
a like
an eyeball that has lost a huge gouge
out of it there's no blood or anything
and it has these
uh six horrible kiteness legs and you
should make a sand roll
sometimes sorry mate success on that
you lose one sanity and there is
a there you know you are surrounded by
horrors
i'll i'll help alexandria with the
in front of her and to take a shot at it
all right take another shot that's a 65
regular success
okay roll your damage all right d10 plus
two
is seven damage ow okay you who
you blow one of the legs off this thing
and it is clearly like
listing it is it is not in good shape
uh and alexandra you are next i'm i'm
going to
take another swipe at it like if
donald's close to him i'm going to use
his shoulder to like swipe up at it and
uh regular success excuse me all
right um
um and uh
you yeah you will you stab up you hit
neat six max damage all right yeah you
like
strike your blade through and um
this thing like all of a sudden it's
like
uh legs tense up and then it just
releases and it falls to the ground
um at the end of the round
you hear a voice behind you say sorry i
forgot
she wanted this one and a hand slides
out of the portal
and puts a book on the table and then
the hand comes back through
there's nothing else in this room and
there's there's just a mod
whose head head down on the table comes
to
what's that book what book is on the
table are you gonna are you gonna try
and rouse Akmala
no okay you look at it and the title
is something in a language you don't
speak
well what does it sound like
phonetically it is in arabic so they
aren't even the letters are not
alphabetical do you think this is the
book
the dhole book i don't know this is our
best bet
um let's look at the library real quick
that bastard that son of a
all right i think this is our best bet
for what joan wants and we need to get
out before he does
we'll just take it yeah we'll we'll nick
the book before you what's his name all
right yeah
yeah i'll i'll i'll like stick it in
into my waistband it's
at the at the small of my back so i can
still use my hands all right both of you
make me
uh stealth rolls your stroke is probably
better than your luck
no they're about even for me believe it
yeah so you you make it out just as the
night watchman is like running down the
stairs
um and uh
um you go running
you know you you get out of there just
before he comes running down the stairs
and you make it out of the
museum let's get back to the military
base as soon as we can
quickly sure yeah you you don't get back
um and you will show the book to joan
joan has never actually seen this book
uh so it is indeed in arabic the
title
is the song of the dole
sweet this is the book john you have to
understand the fellow clive was there
before us
he was there cleaning the library out
every single one of those forbidden
books he has them
but he left this one behind he left he
left it behind deliberately because he
said
i almost forgot she wanted this one
he knew who we were he knew what we
wanted
he knew what you wanted be careful
are you sure you want this book kind of
romantic
well no i mean so he didn't didn't
totally mess us up he
but mostly be careful though in a madame
lin kind of weird way
yes yes exactly that
there's romance and then there's
whatever obsession madame lynn had
and there's a difference the obsessments
yes so
but we got well you guys were successful
then
of course
there was a spider thing attached to a
kid's head
Akmala no it happened
he's fine he was unconscious when we
left but he was breathing fine
it is not clear to you that he is fine i
but i'm going to say it anyway
[Laughter]
we need like the narrator he was not fun
[Laughter]
it was not as as easy as it was supposed
to be there was someone
i mean clive was in there but there was
someone else named agatha
in the in the museum joan you can
make me an archaeology role
yeah yeah
that's a hard success you recall that
there was an agatha broadmoor
so do you know huh well there was
agatha broadmoor was part of the
expedition what a hard success
yeah all right so she was a figure of
some of some controversy because she
okay so she wasn't a scientist she was a
medium that's right
ah okay so she wasn't part of the
science part she was
the spiritual part part of the woo-woo
bit
well whatever she does it works she can
see the picture
perhaps i don't know what so wait do you
she said something to you or what
i was in there i knew we were coming
they were able to dodge our blows
i knew the book we wanted before we can
even
stop them shoot and they had one of the
spider things there that was in new york
the thing that was an eye with multiple
legs
that was here with them and they had
some crystalline spider thing in that
kid's head there's a lot of spider
imagery going on here
damn right probably older than me i
don't know
why are they coming how they've got all
the info now except for this book
my question do you think oh i just was
wondering if you think they stayed
you're thinking that do you think
they're staying at the ritz
i mean we have a lot of questions and he
did
you know i had to go on a couple dates
with madame lynn i'm just saying joan
maybe you got to take one for the team
and go hang out with clive and see
what's up
hey i tried and he just messed us up
okay
so did we really try or did somebody
else point a gun at him
that back just like nope oh man
if that one wouldn't set off youtube
that would be a great title did we try
or did we just point a gun at him
i think that's where we're gonna we're
gonna end it for tonight
uh so next time we will start to figure
out
what all this means and what the clive
expedition is
really doing since they faked their own
deaths apparently
or or are actually dead couldn't go
either way or
are actually dead who knows maybe he
is a ghost
or maybe he went to your guy's school of
coming up with excuses and he's just
like
i'm a ghost can you see me
oh i gotta use
that's a good one no it's the one you're
asleep this is a dream that's another
good one
i mean he did know about the staves
though so you know
that's true that's true so

i found
the very first quote book i ever did

like a bathroom reading book that you
should publish
i agree just
random quotes from cthulhu games you
know yeah i used to post on facebook
quotes from when i was running our home
game
and now in my memories i get like you
know like explosives seemed like a good
idea at the time
[Laughter]
uh so thank you all so much
for the crazy amount of bits tonight
and for your continued support we
we so appreciate it and you know it it
keeps the air conditioning on where amy
is and the rest of us it keeps us out of
air conditioning
uh we cannot wait for
things to be safe enough for us to all
play together in person again
but until then we're gonna make the best
we can out of it
uh here in our respective places
i will say i don't miss driving to
fremont and back that is
you know but i do miss having a camera
that does work
that is i miss being in focus i guess
that's
wear your bloody masks yes

so i guess all it's left to say is
goodbye internet friends
you
