part four that's right well it's a it's
a question chaos one shot
so you know it's speaking of quests
and chaos one shots
tuesday we will we will continue
uh cthulhu in space i by the way
it was worth it just to watch i i
watched on youtube later
uh the opening five minute who's on
first
uh bit about who's the top which thomas
is thomas
and who's the thomas now it was i was
sold at that point it was
at some point i was thomas as well it
was amazing there could only be one
promise
uh so so tuesday that's gonna
happen
in saturday we're back here for real
cthulhu i keep reminding everybody this
is
real cthulhu that other stuff i
uh i want to give a shout out to tom and
the job that he does that he did running
that game
uh i have run a game of call of cthulhu
for the chaos agents
uh on the plus side you somehow got them
to not kill each other yet
which is impressive yet yeah that is
that is the key there
paranoia is building yeah
but so a nice job it's a um
it's a cool story is that a story of
your own creation yeah it is
nice i i i think it's it's really
it's it's great and
uh you know at this point it could be
eight episodes who knows
what it would not be with how much we
role play man
going to be more than two i think we'll
we'll see
we'll see there's a big dinner scene
coming up where it's just going to be an
hour of what you eat
it's going to be like reading a george
rr martin book given given how the last
episode
ended i think cass won't have an
appetite for a very long time that's a
fair point
you got food in cube look and squeeze it
out it'll be fun
that's right just add something to it
uh
amy you wanna you wanna give us some
numbers here all right
this time i actually did watch the epic
all right come on people give us more
people come on
or just doing math exactly i watch that
again i was like god what the hell was i
doing
okay so ladies and gentlemen here we go
the players start with four because we
did not spend like crazy last time
all right everybody write that down then
tomoghatora has given the players 500.
and ezra oh i'm sorry not as we're the
duchess what am i smoking the duchess
all right she might need it she might
need it yep um
no she doesn't need it she's fine her
sword fighting skills are excellent um
then our favorite twitch user squirrel
on the run gave the players 500 and
explicitly said not for ezra
i said that but before we started i said
i'm just excited
that for the the the next week or two i
will not have the worst haircut
in quests and chaos this is true
right apparently real remembering that
my wife cut my hair
and so those are those are bitterness
bits can she come over and cut my
husband's hair because have you seen
that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show okay
i think a flowbee was involved that's my
it's too late man it's going to take
some weeks for that to grow out enough
to take a while
it was traumatic it was highly traumatic
i hear i hear you screamed on a
conference call i did i was on a
conference call and he walks in i mean
just to not make this not make the bits
any longer than they usually are
but like he asked me to so in between
meetings he's like can you cut my hair i
was like i have 25 minutes let's get
this done
go into the bathroom start shaving his
hair realize i am
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up royally i was like i
just dropped the razor i was like i got
to go to a call by
you're on your own buddy he comes in and
again
it was like this weird eight like when i
was doing it it was like
super shaved he's got his hair's all
long it's shaved and then it goes to
this weird v
in the background and i was like this is
terrible i'm like i should stop while
i'm ahead
and not claim responsibility for this
problem so like in my usual fashion i
was like here's your clippers i gotta go
bye
um i turn around 20 minutes later
and he is completely bald completely
bald
and it's not just like bald bald it's
like
closer shaven in some areas than not so
like there's actual bald patches within
a shape
i don't even understand how that happens
and it's really blonde
it was yeah it was way more blonde than
i was expecting it to be
his roots are showing i thought there
were patches yeah
uh i would like to apologize to thomas
for
uh causing so much discussion about
your hair
uh when there's so many other things to
be making fun of you for
this is true but that was just
frightening okay so back to business
um math what let's make fun of amy's
math yeah that's fine
okay so the baroness has given ezra 1500
my oh my god on now he just put a wig
on does he still have the mercer wig
there
yeah he does and he's tucking it behind
his ears
yeah anyway so should we have a gi joe
moment well
while you enjoy the the well actually so
for reasons that will become apparent at
some point before we started this game
we were discussing
uh music and music groups and that sort
of thing and
um it came up that gi you know all these
80 car
80s cartoons had musical villains
gi joe somehow dodged this trait there
was no
musical villain there wasn't even
really a musical joe guy
uh but what i found and this is a a
weird gi joe moment but you can you can
see this it'll if you google it
i found the ballad of gi joe which is
a a a parody
about gi joe done by college humor
with names you will recognize and it's
actually really funny
i i enjoyed it a great deal so check
out the ballad of gi joe when you have a
second it is uh
is it as bad as the ballad of bilbo
baggins i just have to know
uh it is bad you know it's bad it's
charming but it's bad
it is better than that you know i mean
zach galifianakis is involved so
it's weird but it's funny it's good i'm
i'm a fan
okay okay so 1500 from the baroness to
the players
my favorite what i still i can't i still
love the baroness doesn't matter
well she gave you three as well didn't
she or was that yeah so you've got your
three
and then what's the directory it's fair
um
then let's see you know lonely
transactional thing and you know
lowly yeti a thousand to the players
thank you thank you
500 to ezra maybe thank you maybe
thank you question mark yep exactly and
then the baroness
also gave 500 to the players and in
parentheses
all the love to ed squirrel on the run
i'm not sure what's going on there but
i'll take it
say it my least favorite twitch user and
your
you know it's like an amalgam this is
the this is the
that was for that was pretty much just
for nick okay
devastator was a transformer that was he
was the voltron of transformers
and not at all a rip-off of voltron no
not a bit
have i done have i done my form blazing
sword bit on this
you're what no it doesn't sound familiar
voltron is the worst ever made because
every volt episode the old one are the
new one
it doesn't matter there's a new one
is 20 minutes of voltron getting beaten
up and then
at about 21 minutes out of the 22
minutes of the cartoon
voltron forms the blazing sword and just
slices whatever it's fighting in half
just form the blazing sword start with
the blazing sword
you haven't you haven't seen the new one
then okay there is no like
there's no there's no like
canonical reason
it's not like we have to build up the
energy to form the blazing sword no
they can form the blazing sword at any
time the blazing sword
always wins form the blazing sword
they should have just like built a
bigger garage for the blazing sword has
essentially just come out
just build voltron out of whatever you
built the blazing sword out of
[Music]
form blazing voltron uh
actually so never i was like i was gonna
get into it but you know what honestly
because of voltron i always personally
side with villains because the villains
are far more interesting than like the
good guys
and then i went back and thought about
superman i was like yeah
hero suck speaking of heroes suck
the grenade society
i think we were just talking earlier
about following the duchess's lead and
and going in to
reset their universe again yeah the only
thing that
the mission that we were having the only
thing that makes dc watch it watchable
or readable is is the villains they
have better villains than
marvel does but that's about all they've
got for them i'm a marvel guy
so i'm gonna oh no i i'm i'm much more
of a marvel person myself because i like
the stories that they tell but i can't
that most of their villains are just
kind of
tertiary uh
so you find yourself in a sticky
wicket
uh most of you are in a
motor boat with a very limited capacity
uh out in the ocean outside of gray
dragon island
within sight of the beach and on that
beach
you see one of your number flint
uh trying to drag a larger boat
out into the ocean uh
you also have become aware that hands
have started reaching up onto the side
of your motorboat
and flint you have become aware due to a
boat exploding next to you
that you have garnered the attention of
the flesh tank
so we're gonna start in initiatives
uh and we're just gonna dive right in
you might be diving in soon 90s
nothing happened nobody what about
hundreds oh sorry you're right
is your decks really that high now i
have old
it's funny in my decks chart i have your
old decks i got to put your new one in
yes sorry 100 yes
yeah yeah i'm well i mean i'm doing what
i was doing before
i'm trying to i'm reinvigorated to get
this boat
inspired yeah all right make me
hard success all right yeah so you make
a great deal of progress you have
loosened
this boat somewhat and you are
uh the problem is you're essentially
holding on to the prowl of the boat and
like
trying to drag it out and
you know if you had like a rope or
something that you could like
tow it out you'd probably have more
leverage but
you are you know you have made with a
hard success you definitely feel like
you can feel the boat freeing from
the sand
in the in the the lower tide 80s
that's donald yep all right so
he's basically got a shotgun out and
he's gonna as soon as one of their
little heads pops up
before they can do their horrible tongue
thing he's gonna shoot one at close
range and sort of
blast it back in the water all right
make me a shotgun roll
and you definitely have an advantage
die for this
oh fun yeah it's a zero two with the
advantage
all right so there are still two hands
on the thing but that is all there are
uh you have essentially blown
the rest of the kara siri far off
so these
these two kind of white uh
pale hands with sharp fingernails are
just like
latched on to the side of the boat but
not attached to anything else
uh 70s 75 yeah
uh i'm i'm gonna try to cut one of the
hands off
at basically like at the wrist and try
to like
just de-hand a cara siri so it stops
hanging onto the boat
all right so here's how this is gonna
work for you
uh you need to every time you want to
take an action against
akara siri you need to make me a sanity
roll
uh however if you kill or destroy akara
that's kill or destroy that's not that's
not hand sever yes
[Music]
so i have i have fought cars siri before
do i remember that like cutting their
throats works or
like stabbing them through the eye uh
every time you remember anything about
kara siri you stop remembering and
shudder
and lock that in a nice little box
where me bye-bye go over there make me a
uh 12. all right so you can take an
action
thank goodness let me rephrase that if
you don't make the sanity roll
you still can take an action you just
will not take anything aggressive
against akara siri you will try to get
as far away from them as you can
oh god i'm basically under conditioned
frightened it's true
oh god yeah um
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i'm just gonna try to like stab it
through it through the eye type of thing
okay yeah there's a head like coming out
of the water
yeah 24 is
a hard success for me all right yeah
roll so that is max damage on my
daggers that is six okay let's see
here oh
oh oh three this car siri make a
strength roll
uh 13. that's sorry that's a hard
success so your
knife like goes in on the cheekbone
and like it feels like it goes through
the skeleton there
and there's a second where you're afraid
it's gonna get lodged in there
but you just yank it out and this
thing is still inexorably moving forward
yeah i'm going to back up a pace because
i don't want to be there
yeah that's 70s 60s 65
i am going to yell everybody to hold on
tight and i'm just going to
wrench the wheel around and see if i can
spin them nice
hey remember when we said that
unless you tried to do something crazy
you wouldn't need to make a pilot roll
make a pilot roll
i'm laughing i'm laughing hard okay um
you just looked at her pilot skill yeah
oh no i
i got a really good roll but yeah i have
one what'd you roll
i rolled 29. okay yeah
that's very good so all right
uh they they rolled very well so you
lurch the boat around
um with a with a with a good roll like
that
i won't make anybody makes decks rolls
or anything like that so you
you start going in like what you think
are tight circles
um but it does not seem to be dissuading
uh that was so also on a 60
uh they start to go so uh
let's we'll start with alexandria
alexandria
make me this is going to be an opposed
brawl
they are trying to pull you out of the
boat i did back
up i did back up like you know what
you're right you did back up
uh yeah so that one will climb up
uh let's see now we'll go to
emma the one the one next to you is
going to try and pull you into the water
so this is an opposed brawl
humber to paradise come oh yeah
birds of paradise 16 16.
nice i believe we still have a code for
i don't remember what it is but we we
have a code if you use it when you order
the dice you get 15 percent off
chaotic apparently because there we go
it's chaotic that seems to fit
um how'd you do emma what'd you get so i
did 16 my
it's a fighting brawl right yes um
that would be under f so a 16 is
actually a hard success
all right yeah this guy this this
former
uh member of the new china front grab
tries to grab on to you and pull
you in and you are going nowhere donald
uh
you blew one away and a hand reaches up
and it's gonna reach for your shotgun
so it's gonna try and grab your shotgun
so this will be an opposed brawl roll as
well
oh no i'm gonna use a gm inspiration on
this
you got two left no one seconds it
was not nobody matthews 85 i see you
sneaking into chat don't help him out
he's gonna you know he is tom what'd you
get i have a 66. i want to see what you
have
i have better than that we'll inspire
all right let's inspire that because my
brother's right yeah yes
all right good 41 41 is a success all
right so that is a draw
so it has this hand is grabbed onto your
shotgun but it is not
like moving it much you're you're you're
still good to go all right joan
you at the in the at the back uh
one of them is uh
yeah they're not attacking you um
but you hear a
and the the motor starts to like uh
slow and there's a
um i don't know you you'd describe it as
an
unfortunate grinding noise
or is it a fortunate grinding noise am i
grinding them up yeah it's a very
fortunate grinding noise
it depends on if you want to sail away
some enya was forthcoming yes
i grew up on that song i threw up on
that song too
so that was 60s 50s
nope lower
yeah hang on a second
actually wait on a 50 the uh
uh the flesh tank
no oh no what did you get
you should roll a dodge my friend that's
me right
delicious beautiful girls
no oh paradise oh my gosh
all right does my dodge get changed once
my decks went up
andrea i cannot thank you enough for
having me to stop
figure out what happens if an unholy
flesh tank
kills an immortal gorilla
nick got a 98 outstanding
out i love these dice here's a gorilla
we need to get nicks and birds of
paradise we really do then i wouldn't
roll in 98. is that what you want
is that what you wanted all right so
here's what
happens it is that same
horrible human
skull round that is shot at you
right to the chest yes
you immediately oh
you immediately take 17 points of damage
wow which might not kill him
better him than us because that would
flat out kill me oh no that
that actually comes nowhere near yeah
his hit points now at his con are
are silly but here's the thing
that skull has lodged into your chest
because the other one the other one
exploded so i was expecting like slow
motion
i think it's in there i look at it and
i'm like oh
no so this this one is just chewing into
your chest
all right i'm gonna have i'm gonna
change of priorities next round
uh all right and now we go to emma okay
and before i do that unfortunately j
matthews85 did hear what i said and said
oh look ezra dropped this
i mean in fairness you like bray
rabbited him
no everything's fine everything's fine i
haven't been yeah okay
my allergy medication is fine the one
that
alexandria started to saw in half is his
head sort of like lobbing sideways so i
could take a swing at it with my uh
frying pan
sure i love it okay yep so i'm gonna
try and finish the job and knock it off
with the frying pan
i love it all right come on birds
the chad is wondering if the flesh tank
so it's just a regular success not a
hard success loose
uh and i think we said that that does a
d6 damage
plus your damage bonus yeah and my
damage bonus is probably nothing because
it's nothing well there you go oh five
points of damage though that's kind of
philosophical
uh yeah there is a kang as you like
um so in very short order alexandria
just
barely gets the knife out of the face of
this thing as a frying pan comes
flying in and just brains this kara
siri
uh he will make another con roll oh man
he is determined
this guy's not so his head didn't he
didn't come so like
i just want to have like the top of his
head back and just
gone yeah so here's what happens yeah
you guys
are like this now so the cara siri have
the weird distending jaw
and you might knock the top of his head
sort of backwards almost like a hoodie
being pulled backwards and it's slowly
coming back up as it's starting to do uh
uh the telescoping
knife teeth thing uh
and that's not terrifying at all no
no
no put your ass out here
uh he's got he's got his own problems i
sound like a paper shredder we can now
drop things into it
just drop the headdress if you saw
the head press see what would happen
now we have other people on the boat too
they're just all ducking and hiding
right
they want no part of this in fact you
can take a sanity roll for them
um they the only reason they are not
jumping out of the boat
is that those things are out of the boat
no i just want to make sure that they
were all tucked away
they are they are like crammed in the
center of the boat with alexandria
uh none of these people are armed
and so they are as long as they hold on
they are
there's not much to hold on to in the
middle of the boat i know
uh all right we are back to nick yeah
i'm gonna tear this thing out of my
chest
leaving it is a terrifying idea i mean
yeah there's no good answer here
uh making a strength roll
oh birds of paradise giveth birds of
paradise take us so taketh away
i haven't heard the paradise you take
two points of damage and
you pull this skull that is just like
worrying at you and there is like
viscera
uh there's like a line of viscera
from you to it as you pull it out
um but you now have a a oh i get some i
i tossed that
that goes away from me okay i remember
one of those
in the water where are you throwing it
are you throwing it in the water
no just like i'm just trying to
i'm guessing down the beach okay
and then so you throw you huck it
to the side make me a luck roll
the duchess does have inspiration for
dodge just saying
oh because i rolled the 99
so you throw this thing uh
and you throw it
more up than out and it lodges
on the floor of the beach sort of by the
the
the back of this boat this boat is
reverse up on the shore and you're
pulling out the front of the boat out to
sea
uh it takes off the back of this boat so
the boat is much lighter
on the plus side yeah well no there's no
more there's no more point for this boat
anymore
i mean that's hard for the boat to hear
but you know tough truths are
sometimes necessary oh
uh oh we just lost we lost julie just
lost julie
uh we will we'll get her back shortly uh
but so
yeah the the explosive skull uh
blows up and it uh
takes off the back of that boat there
are
there is one more boat that you think is
feasible for this okay um
so that was you nothing else i i do want
to use this boat as cover
my that will be great for cover yeah
you have you have no problem it is much
easier to shoot the boat than it is to
shoot you
uh so that was 90s eight
well that was hundreds 80s down to
donald
so the one that was grabbing doll
shotgun is that one on the boats so
it's one hand on the on the on the side
of the boat one hand on the shotgun
in the water basically it's an easy shot
for you yeah he'll he'll just
take care of this one too put just just
turning the shotgun just enough so it's
a point-blank range
pull the trigger and release this one
from
is it his cursed existence yeah you've
gotta you've got an advantage die on
this as well
big time that makes it a fourteen
oh and would be a hard success
it's the better success critical
critical
uh so you you blow this thing away
like there's now the hand is still
holding on to your no actually
the hand that was on your shotgun like
gets sort of burnt off
because of the heat that the shotgun
shell creates um
the but the hand
the other hand remains on the on the
ledge
uh you blow that one away 70s tiana
make me a sand well actually what do you
so there's still one in front of me
right that has the top of its head like
peeled back like a hoodie
yes fun i want to go for its throat
okay make me a sand roll i hate this i
hate everything about this
uh 19 made it all right make your attack
okay 15
which is a critical success for my knife
all right how what does this kill look
like yeah like
not quite gibbering to herself but
definitely not okay
she like comes in and is able to get a
hand under the chin
and get it up and just like take it take
its head off basically
okay yeah and with that great success um
you managed to like
boot it into the water so that you just
like she's swearing in an italian at
this point
so you've you've killed that one uh
uh that was
seven do i get sanity back you promised
that yeah thank you for buying that you
killed that
hey don't roll on the table ezra you
um the stars are aligned julia's
returned
welcome back thomas all over the the
overlay it's already up he's very quick
we have a crack production team here
you say craft i mean yes but also
[Music]
these fabulous
you rolled a hundred as well one amazing
no way paradise
so good nick make a dodge roll with
advantage
you're gonna need a heck of a roll do it
uh i got a 19 and that is just a
hard success all right so
a hard success is going to minimize some
of the pain
uh it's not going to be double damage
this time um
and so but another one of these
chittering
skeletons this time it latches on to
like your shoulder
and it does oh man
can you use inspiration on damage rolls
no
otherwise we'd be doing that all the
time you're being lightly nibbled on the
shoulder
for two points of damage oh this one's
there's like a little a little yeah
this one's kind of small
it's just like is this a kitten skull
that's right yeah that's right
uh who knows where they get the
skulls you know yeah so
basically i'm just still driving i'm
still driving in circles
and trying to walk yeah you're a 65 so
you're gonna keep trying
so most of the kara siri
that were coming on the boat have been
uh
uh convinced not to come on the boat
um so make me another pilot roll
let's see how bad the damage of this one
gumming up the works is oh i got
a
eight e what's your pilot's name hey
what is it
one i don't know an odd an odd eight is
great
spend more thanks to the camera's my
stick uh
that's a great roll so
wait we steal your sticks all the time
ezra oh yeah come on man i had to it was
it was a thing you know
showing off my hundreds
[Laughter]
uh so but what you don't do is you
don't go like i got
[Laughter]
uh so yeah you you have
you feel like you have there's
there's at least
one that is trying to stop the motor by
um by putting itself in the motor
um and uh
and you have you feel like you're you
you know you're you're
making it difficult for them they're
still getting in there and they're
causing damage but you're making it
difficult for it
yes that was 60s 50s
i think it's emma's yeah i'm at 40.
cora siri yep are they
so the two there are apparently two
around
the the engine and they continue to
try to gum up the works
but it seems you don't notice anything
uh
everybody make everyone on the boat make
oh
there is all sorts of movement under the
water
nope nope just you know there there is
i mean you ha i mean
the new china front sent more than 100
people here
you know they sent a lot of people here
and
um there are a bunch of people
underwater right now just sort of
trudging slowly towards your boat
how many people are
not like when i turn around and look
back to
[Music]
ishiro right taro is not in sight right
now you remember you guys came around
the island
yeah easily on the other side of the
island
so i'm going to run up to joan and be
like i'm on my obviously i'm going to
use my turn and just be like we need to
get
back to ishiro
and get people out of the water we can't
what's his name
taro ishirotaro ishiro taro yeah do
we wanna do we wanna drop
off these guys so they can they
can
they can command the boat once uh
which boats will
drop them on though that we need them
the boats yeah i can't get this boat any
i don't think we can get this boat any
farther in without grounding it
accidentally
or running it ashore yeah yeah yeah yeah
all right i'm i'm all for turning around
and and
seeing if we can really how fast the
gorilla
can swim yeah well should we grab flint
first before we get out of here
well we can't grab them we can't go in
so yeah
we can get let's just do a drive-by
did we bring explosives with us because
we could we could
we could i mean no you said you
i've always got explosives in my bag
yeah yeah yeah right yeah
make me a luck roll i mean i typically
sleep with them why wouldn't i take them
on the boat with me well no no i had one
that's where you were keeping them from
getting in the boat before right so you
still were brand new
you have the one grenade that you
threatened japanese sailors with
okay oh yeah that's right i remember
that now do we wanna yeah do we wanna
do we wanna toss that and so flink can
get away or
who's got who's got good throw skills
and not only that too
is there how do we do this
because like are they so is when we look
in the water
is are there people between us and flint
i mean what do i mean pure
people essentially they have come from
the beach
towards and so they're walking under
they're walking on the surface
down below just slowly trudging towards
you and then when they get to the boat
they kind of kick their way up
yeah okay we gotta we gotta get out of
here we gotta get flint and we gotta go
so yeah let's get close to flint then
we'll drop one
yeah all right okay so so this
round
uh you still have something going on in
the back of the boat with the
we're still an initiative so on a
hundred flynn
oh yeah i'm i'm i'm picking off the
little kitten skull
and and throwing that behind me throw it
at the tank
throwing it behind you i can't get to
the tank yeah because the boat's behind
me i'm throwing it over the boat that
i'm using
okay yeah so you you throw it onto the
beach
uh and there's a sm there's a an
adorable little explosion there's like a
poof
it's like one of those things the kids
throw on the ground in chinatown
and then i'm actually do i do i think i
could like
peek around the far end of the boat to
see if i can like
i don't know how a flesh tank would
detect me but i'm wondering if i can
kind of like stealth my weight
is true you do not know how a flesh tank
would but i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a
a try i'm gonna try and be as sneaky as
possible
to see if it notices me going towards
the other boat
because you're trying to get towards
here the 99
oh yeah outstanding
dude more different dice different
geronimo
uh between between boats
um it turns out that it is very hard
for a
a large gorilla on a beach to not stand
out
uh when you are not standing behind a
large boat so you make it
to you make it to that last
functional boat but you
the flesh tank is well aware somehow
of you it must have like psychic powers
or something
explanation loud uh
by the way someone posted in the discord
last
like right after last episode a picture
of turbo team
and it's nightmare fuel like turbo teen
was just i
the it was the usa cartoon express
caused me so many nightmares
it's it's terrifying turbo team like
was an 80s cartoon about a guy who
turned into a car
and they had a whole transformation
scene of the car
and like his mouth becomes this awful
richtest grin that becomes the front of
the car
and that's kind of what this tank is
that that that horrible grin of the
of the smile all right so yeah it
is aware of you somehow
donald sorry what's the next
target here what's next threatening
carissario on the boat
so there you joan has made it clear
that there are two
under the water that are doing something
trying to do something to the engine
okay any other ones i can shoot it i
mean there's plenty down there but you
don't think a shotgun
um the shotgun is a very poor long
distance fishing tool
yeah and also it will also blow up
engines too if i'm not careful
so there's no others clinging to the
boat
not no i mean there's there's hands on
the boat but they seem to be only hands
okay all right so he donald will
stow the shotgun grab one of the rifles
that we have an abundance here
and then let's begin looking for a
target that he may he may have to shoot
off
okay yeah you have switched to a rifle
uh that was 80s 70s alexandria
i see no immediate threats i'm going to
go and
just like not quite cower but definitely
hang out very close behind
joan crouching a bit watch watching
where we're going and just like
make me a spot hidden role
all right you are unfortunately aware
that there are two you have come
closer to the two that are still
worrying you
uh and and you do not enjoy that you you
definitely feel that
no all right that was uh
70s 60s 65
65 you players always go first yeah
so
is there anything i can i can think of
like you know like
in a car and you rev it and you can you
can change the way the engine goes and
things like that is there anything like
that here where i could try to shake
them off the the motor
i can go i mean you could play
with the throttle yeah on an outboard
motor you
you you you'd be you know they're a lot
they're very easy to flood
uh true true true so i mean that would
be the concern there
um also you are as good a pilot as
anyone who's never piloted a boat so
that comes into play as well
um so you don't know i mean
you literally know almost nothing about
piloting boats or outboard motors or
i'm doing the thing okay so we
we need to go around the side um
do we want to get closer so people can
like do something to the flesh tank and
try to ex to get flint back
guys you you it's your turn what are
you doing
yeah oh i know but i'm just like all
right um
all right i'm gonna go i'm going to to
go toward the beach because
yeah yeah you go in and you can get
pretty close to flint without
uh without worrying about running
aground um
you see about i don't know a quarter
mile to the left
on the beach you just see a long
unending string almost weirdly single
file
of people just slowly walking into the
ocean yeah we got to get out of here
flint going closer to this mess
yeah we gotta get flint wind
all right so that was that was that uh
also on a 60
um it's aware of you but it's also now
aware of a boat full of people
let's let's make a spot hidden roll
for a tank there's a sentence you don't
say every day
birds of paradise
ah damn it and i can't do anything to
camouflage us like i can't
pull up the colors the the calamari arms
and wave like
siri
emma just pulls up a sheet of camouflage
material
he's got a poncho all right so
um
joan make me a piloting role i just
enjoy
someday you're gonna roll an 01 and oh
no i gotta i got a 51.
is that inspirable do we want to inspire
that pilot
god bless america i mean why now you
gotta know i bothered
yeah you got not five so yeah he got
exactly almost the opposite of what i
got
andrea by the way andrea wants you to
know that she's gonna be doing a
redesign of the site so get your
orders in for dice that seem to only
roll
critical successes for the flesh tank i
uh just put put my face with thumbs up
on the front of them because a picture
like i these birds of paradise
are ezra approved they're the only dice
i will ever roll here these are
fantastic so with an odd five um
all of you are aware
that a you hear a kind of
distant thud and then you see
you know you have a long list of things
you've seen that you thought you'd never
see
this was not on that list as a skull
is rocketing towards you at high speed
and you can like somehow
yeah somehow you see its mouth it's just
like
um and uh
it hits the boat for double damage
oh
i don't even know how to make up how
many hit points a boat has but it's
going to be more than that
so this skull uh
comes inside the boat and it hits on the
on the the base of the boat which is is
wood
and it's just you can see it just going
like
it's like eating into the wood uh
of this thing and there is already like
a major
chunk taken out of the it it goes
through like the side of the boat
and takes off part of the the
railing
and it's now on the ground and it's just
are we thinking no there's no water
coming in
but your boat has definitely taken a a
serious damage that was 60s
50s the two cars siri by the engine
are going to try and do something
apparently birds of paradise really like
the flesh tank but not so much these
poor moocs there is underwater
there
we we cut to like the scene of these two
of the apple dumpling gang of kara siri
like getting in a slap fight as they try
and they're literally trying to just put
their bodies
into the rotors to stop the engine and
it is not working
uh they are both like you know like
it's the two guys trying to go through
uh very sad very very sad that was uh
50s emmas
all right so i'm gonna take my frying
pan and try and scoop the head
out of the boat and launch it back
oh like an atlatl you're yeah
uh okay make me
i don't know what it's a what a dex roll
okay oh birds
and that is an extreme success so so
in one of the most like fluid moments
of emma's life there is like just a
scoop
this this thing i'm a highlight player
now just straight up
highlight the only sport where it is
illegal to be left-handed
you come in and just in a an incredibly
fluid motion
you like see this the skull nope you
scoop it down and you just
fire it back at the at the beach
make me a luck roll oh
oh birds again i just made it i made it
by four but i made it nonetheless
there is an explosion nowhere near any
of the boats or
gorillas that you are currently
because there's so many gorillas that
we're interested in yeah i don't want to
listen
so i'm going to take up a defensive
position to and again
was more of a field hockey player in
high school but apparently softball was
i'm i'm now picturing her as rapunzel
with the frying pan
uh outstanding yes you are like after
that
you like flip it and shoot it out there
and you are in like the ready stance
yeah exactly right
yep outstanding back to the top of
the lineup
uh flint getting this boat towards
is this this is is this further down
away on the beach it's farther away from
the car
siri yeah can i actually is it far
enough that i can kind of
v off in another direction further away
from all of that
no nope yeah so the beat
it's it's right about where the beach
starts to curve up
to make this like a cove okay then i
will uh
i'll just try to start pulling it down
and that would be a critical
all right that comes right out i should
have said yeah this
the explosions have really loosened it
up and so yeah you pull this one out
this is
uh this is about the size of your
current boot it's a it's a you know
a large motor boat essentially um
and so yeah this boat is now free in the
water
um you're welcome to try and pilot it oh
yeah
that's next round that'll be next round
yeah all right that was one hundreds
uh we go to tiana alexandria 870
something
donald duck at 80. sorry so donald your
your rifle is out
all right we took care of that skull
situation so he's going to run to the
back of the boat and kind of
try to figure out what julie was or joan
was pointing at
all right it's a little crowded at the
back of the boat with alexandria there
and everybody
so make me a spot hidden roll with a uh
uh difficulty die
okay at disadvantage
a six knocked up that's a 65
which is not
incredible it's a penalty die
disadvantage is a term for a game that
we don't talk about
i'll take that it's two points away
i'm trying to stuff i want to spend luck
on this or not i vote yes
yeah do it first we do well also what is
your
would it would it be reasonable to try
to re-roll it
he's got a 60 and two in a penalty die
so yeah but your penalty your skill
is high enough though that i'm almost
i think we inspire it and try that
before before you spend luck
i agree let's do that i'll go for it i
smell an igni coming right now
all right maybe an emma so this is a 64
which is one better
oh now you're able to play luck i'm
spending
one point of luck all right there we go
so yeah you can see
um a little bit under the water
there are two kara siri who are
not doing a particularly effective job
of trying to like stop the
yeah he's considering he's gonna shoot
one of those two with the rifles
yeah the rifle is the rifle is a much
better long range
fishing tool so take a shot all right
that is regular success 75.
all right roll your damage all right for
this one
they are not aware enough to dodge
seven plus four is 11 damage all right
so yeah there is you
kablam one of them is definitely uh
uh not not loving life
unlife uh
uh all right that was 80's 70's
alexandra um
donald just ran up next to you said
okay it's fine
it's good it's all gucci oh man so we
have a new guy in the chat
i have to explain i'm the only person
here who doesn't like d and d
it's my shtick i have my reasons
it's fine i'm right you're all wrong
everything's great
you're going on yeah i'm gonna
like scoot away from the back of the
boat because donald's way more effective
at this at the moment than i am so i'm
gonna move further up and see if i can
spot flinch and
like we're stuck here at the moment
because of him i would like to get out
of here
because of him ouch that's make me a
spot hidden roll
he knows what i mean i think
probably ought one of all the times to
get not one
so you see flint like
um doing the thing that i was never able
to do that like
but my dad is great at that running boat
uh uh
like where you you run the boat out into
the water and somehow jump into the boat
at the same time
yeah don't knock the boat over i could
never do that my dad is like great at it
but
um but it's even more impressive when
you see a a
a several ton gorilla you know a huge
gorilla jump in
and do that and he has a
a motorboat he has another motorboat
about the size of yours that he's about
to start up
okay i'm going to yell that information
to joan
to be like he's got a boat he's on he's
on his way we get out of here we get out
of here now
all right that's that's 70s on a 60
65 65 players go first
so yes yes i i totally heard
alexandria and i okay i'm going all
yep
going back point and you know what make
me a pilot roll and just don't roll
really bad
you say that you said it he said it oh
no
66. it's not terrible it's not terrible
but it's not great
so you are definitely not making your
best speed you have turned around
out of the you know you were kind of
doing a tight circle you've turned
around out of it and you were going the
way you want to go
but donald you can actually see that
uh that the one that you like really
damaged
is just like sticking his hand in the
propeller
to like slow it down so you're going
like half you're you're hammering the
throttle
and it's just like one of those coming
up the engine so it's good it's arm is
let's go we just gotta go also on a 60.
um
since you are moving i'm going to give a
penalty die to the flesh tank
[Music]
ready emma yep oh no this is fantastic
so my my worst is a 30.
uh let's see how
uh joan make me a luck roll
oh yeah oh yeah hard luck 21 got it
okay with a hard success so this thing
will
hit the boat but it's gonna fall
short of being inside of it but
it takes a good like it hits the railing
and takes off
about three inches of the railings
and then it shoots into the water um
uh probably to blow up soon who knows
yeah
60s on a 50 the
two sad cara siri will try and be
effective
no wow
those two guys those two guys see
they're still slap fighting with one
hand
yeah one yeah one of them like the one
that has his hand in the motor
is like trying to show the other guy
what he's like
and the other guy's just like get out of
my way
i won't be the hero yeah
she's gonna ask if they were married but
oh wherever you are michelle that's for
you
uh all right that was 60s
that was 50s emma um
no flying heads coming at me that i can
smack then i'm just gonna
wait well you know what that would be
even better yeah the head is you want
the head's there so you can hit it again
that's more yeah i'm just going to
try and smack the head off the boat make
me a fight brawl
uh which i think is either oh
you're playing t-ball essentially you
can say like
um you i'm like
the wind nice so you just come up on the
side of the boat
and you step into it and whack uh
beautiful follow through you you
keep your shoulder down the whole way
exactly eyes down the whole time and
you just shoot this skull back onto the
beach
um and with an o3 it like blows up and
you see
like the line of cara siri has been uh
uh
has disrupted some because of that
amazing shot
uh all right that is top of the
lineup
flint you are sailing a boat out of
there as long as you're not trying to do
anything crazy
uh so the only thing that i'm oh yeah
i i sorry everyone i'm gonna take the
scenic route back
i'm going to i'm going to do a slow arc
away and i'm going to
peel around the other direction of the
island all right are you looking for him
in particular
no i'm i'm looking for not flesh tank
yeah all right yeah
so yeah you are you are immediately
going the way
that is peeling away from this
from the flesh tank no problem uh
that was 100's 80's donald
that's a fella who's arm's stuck in the
engine we need to get rid of this guy
okay cute luckily because you're not
going very fast i'm not going to put any
penalty die on here so just take your
shot
and 97 means the gun jams or amount
of ammo yes
horrible yeah
or something worse than that no i think
it's just gonna this will just be a jam
okay rifles are 99 to 100 for jams
right no you're right rivals are 99 for
100 for a gym all right um
so let's uh
51 success okay so
um so uh
so you come down and you you and
the the the one that is not doesn't have
his hand in the motor like
sees your rifle and he doesn't get a
hand on it but he just whacks it out of
the way
uh he just slaps it out of the way so
that you're shot uh
you don't even take the shot because
you've just been too disruptive
uh all right that is 80s 75 70s
alexandria
i don't know what to do don't
die you're sailing away from the island
which you're you're a fan of
i'm a very big fan of that um
i'm not a fan of what i think i need to
do which is
check underwater or like look down and
jump
in the water no god no
i have ideas about that we don't play
that game
um no i want to look down in the water
and see if there are any cars siri like
immediately near us
or approaching us or
i hate everything about this sentence
make me a spot hidden roll
okay 51
i feel like i didn't want to make that
one so
um it appears that at the speed you're
currently
going like the the truck the trudging
guys are getting closer
you're not making enough speed to like
keep away from them
all right i'm really not okay with this
and i'm going to yell back at junk
please give it everything it's got
they're catching up make me a sand
made it but just and only because i had
hi lindsay hi lucy hi jesse
lucy lucy's sad because it was flea
treatment weekend
oh yeah
uh all right so did you make it i
made it by one
nice all right so you are not
totally repulsed
and disgusted by the car as the the uh
uh
amputated kara siri arm that is like
right next to your head as you look over
but there's like a shutter there we were
like
can i like reach out with the tip of a
knife and like flick it off
just to get it out away from me you made
the sand roll sure
yeah cool you're just like flip you just
get them the hand off of there yeah
there's two hands there are two hands
there's there's at least
two more attached to the boat you get
the person who doesn't have a severe car
a serial phobia to deal with that i just
we're good it's fine with us being out
at sea for so long someone's bound to
or they're bound to eat someone
essentially that's a problem
uh 60s 60s
i i gonna whatever i can do to get back
faster i'm gonna try it like i'm
thinking you know if i i'm gonna try to
all right make me a luck roll
because that's more of what this is than
oh yeah i made it i made it i got a 58.
uh so they got slightly better so
you don't you don't dislodge them but
you don't flood the engine or anything
so there's this like going ahead and
um this guy's fingers are like donald
you can see
like his fingers are just slowly
disappearing as
there the he's like gumming up the end
but you can clearly see the propeller
being slowed every time it hits
uh the the the kara siri
um all right that is uh
you are now i'm gonna give the flesh
tank a
disa advantage die the good news for uh
flint is that there are more people in
oh my gosh i've got an odd eight and
even with a penalty die birds of
paradise come through
what it is 28 so another bam
and another skull comes shooting towards
the
boat ah this one's much better
um that's relative
uh actually this one
let's see here we'll make a luck roll
for a flesh tank yeah all right
so this one flies into uh
the the poor guys huddled in the middle
oh no and it just like
latches on to one of them and starts
like
and this guy's screaming and
[Music]
throw them up that'll be another sanity
roll for the boat no they
you're still a better bet than
uh that was on a 50 these two poor guys
the boat starts to slow like now so
essentially he's gotten like the
fingers weren't slowing it down enough
so now he's gotten into the hand
heading towards the arm and that has
uh back to you so flint you are sailing
around the side
uh when you get to the side when you you
turn the corner
and you see turn the corner is a
weird way to put it oh so this was like
a
boat this was like a cove and you've now
turned come around the edge of the cove
away from the flesh tank
okay we're going a long long way around
the island
okay i was just under the impression
that if there was any point where i
could not be close to the island but if
it's a cove then okay
yeah so you're gonna come out and then
you're gonna you're gonna you know
you're gonna come out and then come out
on an angle
angling away from the island off in the
distance you see
a a canoe and
in the canoe which is out of the water
like this
you see the duchess sitting down here
and you see tidwell
rowing for his life i knew it
uh and they are rowing out to sea are
the oars actually touching the water
just curious barely only because it's
tidwell she's fine let her go
something else important if there's some
sort of like sea captain hat in this
boat
i don't think there is but if i could be
a girl
roll make me a leopard that's
outstanding i want to see a
thousand pound gorilla wearing a cat a
tiny hat
alas no just one of those straw hats
i'll i'll inspire that
i will legit i've got a decent chance
i don't know where the other dice went
but it doesn't matter because i rolled a
yeah so so yeah as as
as he was doing the run into the boat he
like scooped up
a like captain's hat that does not fit
him at all and it somehow is staying on
the massive
it's always when it's something stupid
uh all right that was
hundreds donald 80s
let's try to get this guy off our engine
so i'll take another
take another shot yeah this time so 12.
so that's
a extreme success so you
you yeah this guy you blow him away
uh his head ceases to be and
the the cutoff arm that was now down to
about here
starts to like float down to the to the
uh
surface and the engine almost
immediately picks back up
let's go joan grab onto the rail
70s alexandria yeah i'm i'm just hanging
on as as
uh as soon as the boat starts to pick up
speed looking around to see where in the
name of god flintland
okay um
uh so you guys immediately start to
pick up speed
and you see uh
um we're gonna come out of initiatives
for a little bit of a cinematic han solo
moment as
um as you see the like flood of kara
siri
that are starting to surface and all of
a sudden you hear
uh another boat and you see taro at the
front of the boat with the submachine
gun
just like that starting to like mow down
the kara siri that are coming up
and he he will cover your escape in a
boat that is just
full of of sailors and then they will
tear off
and follow you and you are able to get
away uh
uh back out to the island and i assume
you're all going to reconnoiter in the
in the wreckage zone yes yes
so you all make it back to the wreckage
zone of the destroyer
um the the the what the
uh there are no there's still kara
siri hands
on the boat but there are no kara siri
that you can see
um and you can you you're
thanks to flint's boat you're able to
save about
15 more sailors yes um
there's still probably 30 sailors that
are just
can we can we use some rope one of them
is a sailboat right
so there wouldn't be an engine behind it
could we use rope and tie that to
flotation devices to gradually try and
pull people back
i think this no the sailboat blew up
right you have another motor
you have a motor boat there was we we
went in
originally and we got one boat yeah
sorry you're right no no uh
no the people the people stole that and
sailed off those are the guys who like
ditched
that's right because you gave it to like
like six guys got on it and they
took off but what's the boat but what's
the boat that taro's on is that another
motorboat no that is that is like this
that's
that's like the boat you were trying to
get off the island initially it's a
small
um tug it's essentially a tugboat okay
so it's got like that has like 30
sailors just jammed on it
um and because of your sub machine gun
they're listening to what taro says
uh the six guys on the on the sailboat
did not have that confunction they were
the one who are like
hitting you know like trying to kill
anybody who got on their boat
they've taken off so you have two
motorboats and a tugboat
right and about
let's let's call it 30 sailors in the
water
so you have probably you have a total of
50 sailors between your three boats
that are if your three boats are just
filled
to yeah you know almost unsafe
do we have any rope to do a tow with a
big piece of wood or something
or just enough to tow a celebrity it's
definitely going to slow you down
and you know just say something horrible
is in the ocean
yes they have no coming toward us what
everything's fine hey now with the no
penhue dead we don't have to worry about
another
black cursed water tidal wave so
yeah yeah all right let's just do
whatever we can to help these guys yeah
yeah you you know you can like i said as
long as you're willing
to go slowly you can rig up with rope
uh so i've got an
idea if we've got the two motor boats
and this could be horrible but if we
could set up poles between them
to kind of like make a space that's fast
and then put like
raf basically make like an elevated
we're trying to make a catamaran yeah
yeah the challenge is making a
catamaran that can hold 30 people
but that's what you're talking about
it's putting bolt poles and maybe some
flat things and people can sit on it
i mean i feel like the tug boat can
pull it's probably the boat to pull the
the wood pieces
just because you know the motorboats are
not you know they're already straining
against the people that you have in the
small outboard motors are just not doing
great and we have no idea how much gas
we still have or anything like that
well i was almost thinking we were going
to have to siphon the fuel from one of
these
to the other and uh
i mean if you could somehow figure out a
way to get those fuel tanks down yes
that's what i'm that's what i'm thinking
can we is there a way that we can
deal with that the just just to once
again paint the
paint the picture and for those of you
just joining us
um last time they were on a destroyer
a a massive vessel with a crew of over a
hundred
and in it got disassembled in seconds
and so
floating above them about 10 feet in the
air is a completely disassembled
japanese destroyer
illuminated out and how
how high up are like the closest pieces
and does it look like there's anything
if we could get some sort of
anything that tied with do we think we
could grapple anything onto them and
climb up
or do we have a flint that could jump up
and
right not not from a boat because i'd
sink the boat this is
this is like old school mario
platforming yes
um you're i mean you you could
maybe but it would be very dangerous
and you don't know when that thing's
gonna stop floating
yeah we don't want to be under it that's
for sure we don't want you wouldn't be a
person killing me
[Laughter]
i want to try and get i can get anything
yeah because my thought is if the fuel
tanks are separate and they're floating
how do you make them unfloat how do you
make them magically unfloat
that's what's gonna say do i know
anything do i know anything that's like
about flying i don't really have i don't
have anything about flying i just have
the water one right now oh no this is
magic this won't make any sense
throw enough weight on it maybe what
happens will not be intuitive
no no i was just thinking of you know if
i if i did a spell for it to be able to
go into water would it go into the water
but how could you ride it and propel it
home
rope we pull it in we reel it in
like a side fish shoot the pa the energy
out the back and just
right like right in the sky home like a
it's got as much chance of working as
anything else you've suggested
yeah no we just need to not be under
here that's all there is to it so
um there is a brief moment where you
know all your boats are together
and taro looks at you all
and for the first time you see like the
strain of all this on him as
you know he's well aware that the only
thing keeping him alive and these men
doing what he says is a sub machine gun
um i'll give him the i'll give him the
hat
it makes him feel a little better and
and you also are are seeing the like
fear and and
you know base survival instincts in the
uh in the eyes of these sailors
you know they just want to get out they
are terrified yeah and the 30 that
have the bad luck of being in the ocean
borderline angry as one might expect
um luckily you don't understand japanese
so you don't know what they're calling
you
um but but taro is like um
where where do we go oh i was going to
ask that question
there must be some other islands nearby
we don't have any maps
perhaps does anyone know well we saw we
we had to have looked at maps before
heading here right
you've looked at some yeah i mean you
you abdicated a lot
of the navigation to the japanese yeah
[Music]
well is there anyone on here that that
is one of the people that we abdicated
that too
who would have had a good look at a map
uh
taro will turn around and say something
in japanese
um oh sorry
like probably more pressing did we look
for the translator
yeah we did we got him yeah we got that
guy is on your boat yeah okay
yeah yeah make me a group luck role
i need i need four successes
oh yeah oh yeah i don't even have to
roll the second one to know that
oh no but not not a
that's four fumble so julie you got a
hard success
yes sir okay i got 12. yeah i also got a
hard success because half of 36. this is
like the translator the the the
navigator
is not one of the people in the water uh
that would have been a fun conversation
hey could you jump in the water so we
can bring this guy on
uh so one of the guys
on um
on flint's boat is a navigator
and he was he was one of the
navigation aides and he like
he like remembers yeah there's like an
atoll uh
that was fairly close to here right we
then i think that's what we're doing
right let's go let's go
all right so by this time you you got
there very early in the morning
uh i think you got there
like around nine or ten in the morning
god i'm showing my covet life
nine nine o'clock that's so early uh
but so it's probably it's about noon
by the time you start to head off
towards this at all
um towing the 30 guys even with the
tugboat and trying to keep your little
flotilla together
you are not making great speed um
you the the navigator feels like you
will be to this
uh island before night okay good good
good
um and so yeah about
about five you make it uh
to this it's it's a
you know maybe a half mile of
rock and sand but it is better than
you know for those 30 guys it's better
than
being on a boat yeah
a lot of like most of the people on the
boats
quickly get on the island yeah okay
does that talk about radio we can use
well we brought a radio with us but it's
just not long distance yeah and the tug
is the same thing the tug
does not have a radio that can well why
don't we keep going and try to get
to a mainland is there is there anything
at all
on the island it is rock and sand
um do we have anything can we look
for anything like and like in hindsight
i think we would have done this
but look for anything like tarps that we
can use as water collectors
for them just to extend
survival gosh
yeah the tugboat has a tarp that you can
use for that yeah make sense
all right then yeah before we leave them
we can
we can set up like a basic water
collector like they'll have hardly
anything
in it by the time morning comes around
but it'll be something so they're
not completely screwed yeah and i
and i think that it might be the best
idea to take something to take the
tugboat because that might be able to
handle the open ocean a little bit
better
and go and try to find take taro
maybe with us and try to find
someone the other japanese fleet
more of the japanese fleet tarou and the
navigator
and the west and a couple other key
people and then people that yeah people
that taro trusts
if there's any yeah the only problem
with that is they may get
the people might get upset if we're
trying to take people from them and
well so no what taro says is and he'll
say this very quietly
and you know he doesn't think any of the
crewmen speak english so he's only
speaking english at this point he's like
um i don't know how we leave
people here we have to tell them that
someone has to get bring help
to them yeah the radios won't work then
someone has to go find help
and and towing people through it through
the ocean isn't an option either there
is not enough room
on the boats for everyone even even if
they even if they get rid of the damn
white people
there isn't enough room yeah for
everyone
people start getting hypothermia in the
water if they're being dragged during
the night too
so it's not and if we take one boat and
move fast we might be able to get there
get help and get back
in a day and a half maybe two if we
leave other boats here they will not be
here when we get back
well we're going to empty out the fuel
tanks so what are they going to do drift
burn burn the boat row burn
the boat no no no no no no no no no
one's really behind it's a signal the
fire of this will signal other passing
no no no they need to shelter on the
boat we might want to
we might actually want to look into
breaking apart like the already damaged
boat to so they can set
fires so that they can stay warm during
the night yes yes
yes we're going to empty out the fuel
tanks of the other two boats
uh i can tip one over and use parts of
the other one to make like a makeshift
little shelter
like a little lead to you're leaving one
empty motorboat and then you're breaking
the other mode the damaged motor boat
apart for it to be like fire and shelter
and that's yes
yes well no the one that we're not
breaking apart we can
make a little lean two out of because
that one's more stable and
and you're going to and you're gonna
take the tugboat
yeah yeah yeah we're gonna fill the
tugboat up completely from the fuel from
the other two
well not completely but as full as we
can get it and what do i tell these 70
men if they disagree with this plan
well the monkey can keep them in line
but also we can take the wounded perhaps
the sick and the wounded who can't
survive we'll bring on the tug with us
tell them we're going
no no no we're not do you just tell them
that
she wants them to think that i'm gonna
lie to my men
yeah no no i'm i'm saying no like we're
not don't tell them that obviously no no
no no no we need we
we need to find somebody that can that
can has a big enough road to be able to
bring them all back that's all there is
to it
we're not going to do that by staying
here you told them that their chances of
surviving
are are better here are we going back to
shanghai
uh is that closest i mean what's the
navigation we're gonna find the closest
thing
we're gonna get a boat through whatever
means that are necessary and we'll come
back and rescue these men
now i have to find where the map is
there's like a map that has
grey dragon island on it here we go
[Music]
oh closest closest
closest what is closest what does that
mean
so
you are kind of equidistant
between shanghai
well no not equidistant taiwan
is probably the closest place okay
that's not cheap does
not want to go to taiwan who wants
taro yeah no he does not
he can stay on the boat he can stay on
the tug boat we have a train
help us they will not help us
yeah no we can we can get a boat how
you how force if necessary
now we need we must have nothing to do
what what what did they speak in taiwan
at this point
chinese okay is it formosa at this point
or is it so is it
taiwan yeah no we need we need to get
back
it's closer we can get a boat it's not
like we're completely devoid of funds we
can rent
something do we have anybody who can
talk
yes we have our transportation you have
a chinese translator with us
you sent hundreds of the new china front
to their death
taiwan we're not actually run by the new
china front
the new china front hates japan
yeah you'd stay on the stay on the boat
he's got a point though
is there another location we can go to
that doesn't hate the japanese
shanghai is is the other closest
we can also it's a longer trip but the
very southern tip of japan
about twice the journey is shanghai so
two days
yeah it's great
honestly though that might be our best
option for for trying to get
help that will actually come without so
without lighting a powder keg on fire
we're not we're not looking
one more on here we're not looking for
staying wherever we're going
are there [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] things what about
shipping lanes near here we can get
other help with other boats uh
yes so the navigator knows the usual
he he's got a the navigator has an
alarming knowledge of the chinese
shipping lanes
uh and there is
a a shipping mainly south sort of
looping around taiwan heading down
towards macau and that sort of thing
these are these are japanese soldiers in
uniforms
so just i'm i'm sure somebody can
mask out on his crew do we have enough
fuel
at the speed that we would go to get to
the tip southern tip of japan
that would be the first question to ask
is that if we go two days out
it would be because four days
do we think they're gonna that these
this many people are gonna survive for
four days without
water on an island with like tons of
exposure
it's not likely we just need to rent a
boat that's big enough to take people
back
i think shanghai is why don't we leave
it up to our friend to the side
but it's his men so then do we have
enough fuel to get to shanghai
i mean let's talk real quick
shanghai or taiwan are no problem i
think shanghai i think shanghai because
if we're trying to get a boat and
they're trying to ask us any questions
or anything like that what are we going
to say
what are we what are we going to say in
shanghai that that we're going to be
going and rescuing japanese sailors on a
little
we're not we're just renting a boat from
the boat you can can can you drive a
boat we're going to have to have someone
piloting
i have been driving a boat i mean it's
pretty easy
we do have a guy who's a pilot who was
on my boat he freaked out a little bit
but and yeah we do have the navigator
it's not like we
we have people who can man it we just
need to get them a boat that's big
enough to bring
one we have to get some supplies and
first aid kits and medical
man i don't know only you knew someone
rich yeah
exactly don't though
oh no no no absolutely not no
that's why my vote's for taiwan
specifically and
but in taiwan we just we don't have any
inns we don't know where to go we know
where to go in shanghai we have places
we know about
i like how we go just to get away from
that
shanghai is the opposite she's going to
be waiting for us
no she isn't she's busy terrorizing the
town oh no
no she's going to be waiting for us well
and and and here's the question
if we go back to shanghai and we ask her
for a favor
nope what can we owe her at that no
he's not gonna she's not gonna give us a
favor
she's gonna try and kill me again we we
we
again again what what did she try to
yeah she tried to stop alexandria in her
trial wait yes
he's going to be waiting no we should go
to taiwan why did she try and kill you
because she wants to turn someone else
into a gorilla
that she can control oh that makes sense
yeah joan your your argument for written
for shanghai is that we know people the
problem is that everyone we know is
either dead or hates us
or terrible or left yes like
that and we're only american in rogers
we should go to rogers
and we can let the japanese rescue their
own people oh dear gods
roger are you you say that in front of
taro no
absolutely not we don't no we're helping
them we we dragged them into this
rogers was going so when you say when
when donald
says we should you know let the japanese
rescue their own people
and like like turn very very carefully
and look at taro like
i agree with him no listen taro
where do you want to go it's your people
it's your boat you want to go
you want to go shanghai we have too many
enemies in shanghai
you can just drop us off wherever it is
we we we want to help you we put up we
we
we made sure to help as many of your
people as we could we could have run
we want to help us i appreciate that
that is why i came back
i honestly think that we should get a
boat in taiwan
and then we should go to japan
[Music]
what do you want to do we have
we have no money how will we buy a boat
we have a gorilla
we can just take a boat if we really
need to if we can't wire any funds
we just take a boat i look forward to
is still possibly on the island i think
i think his accounting skills have begun
to atrophy
along with other things a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
oh man i think on that note we're going
to go to break so
um before we go to break a few things oh
we're doing a t-shirt giveaway so type
hashtag chaos into the into the chat
to be entered to win one of the three
remaining t-shirts that we have
no we have so a t-shirt
giveaway
and then since some people came in late
um and and mainly since jd matthews came
in late and because he gave bits
uh if you want to play i'm going to be
running
a um
a one shot a test of a gen con scenario
next sunday
at one o'clock pacific and if you want
to play in that
uh put type this the first six people
to get madness
into the discord call of cthulhu i'll
i'm gonna drop you a dm and we're gonna

be very jelly man those are those are
precious
oh yeah can you still get those on the
store i don't know
i think so i'm sure what
yeah i heard a yes maybe maybe next
week i'll fund a giveaway of a flask
just there we go
[Music]
uh so um
yeah we we're we're back i to once
this show is over please you know don't
do well you can do more than one thing
it's the internet
uh on the discord the apollyon has uh
uh created an image of this
of this episode already that is
uh as amy said i'm not sure we're
gonna top it so maybe we should just
stop here but
um it's pretty fantastic so check out
the uh
discord when you get a chance to uh
look at that
and see see amy as you've never
seen her before
boom i have i don't know if emma would
um so yeah you are you are
on a on a on a tugboat about to head out
from leaving a bunch of guys on an
island trying to decide
which of the three bad choices is the
least
bad choice taro
strongly thinks shanghai is the best
choice
but he defers to
the thousand pound gorilla really
we haven't even we haven't even started
on taiwan
uh we have a lot of contacts there i
still have warehouses
yeah but it's his people to rescue if he
wants to go there yeah
no and i like i said yeah we've got a
place to go there
i do not have a boat there but i do have
seafront warehouses that we could dock
at so that we wouldn't have to dock at a
public dock
all right i mean i won't be able to help
once we get there
that's the only thing i'm staying i'm
staying hidden
well and none of us will really be able
to do a whole lot honestly
because we don't speak chinese and sort
of go into the people that we really
don't want to see
um we're not going to be any help
in showing so it would in short be up to
you taro to secure a boat i have
resources
in shanghai and food i'm very hungry
it's been almost 12 hours uh
yes those that is among the resources
that i have there i used most of my you
know we moved
uh most of our uh
most of our things but in yes um
very well if you don't mind we
will take
our pilot and i will give him orders
all right and we should be there and and
back
with it with something within what two
days
yes it it should be i mean this
this boat is slower than a destroyer
uh but yes it should be about a day
and then hopefully faster back
if the only reason that it took us so
long
coming was because of the tidal wave
oh i thought you meant the never mind
duchess i was like okay that's what you
want to call her
we had issues just kind of overall
um so there is a little bit of
commotion
with people wanting to be on the boat
uh that is going but i'm gonna back up
i'm gonna stand up with taro and make
sure
yeah that that that controls it somewhat
um he actually asks how many men you
want to bring
do you want do you want enough to
crew potentially a boat that we get
that seems like a good idea that's a
as long as there's not double the amount
of people
here yeah we don't want to we could
potentially weigh down the boat
i say kind of guiltily
uh i mean he he wants to bring 15 men
to really crew a
uh a boat large enough to take
what is there now their 70-something
sailors
80 something sailors left on the island
i'm gonna say
very quietly can we control them please
do not take this in the wrong way
are you positive that we will be able to
maintain control of this boat
with 15 people who aren't well us
you are all armed they are not
we've got a giant ape desperation we'll
make people do a hell of a lot
i'm not sleeping anytime soon what i
cannot guarantee is that some of them
won't disappear once we get to shanghai
well in that case it's what matters most
is just bringing people that you can
trust not people that are effective
yes yes so again the ship
was not my ship how many people do you
know
personally on the ship very few
yeah i trust i trust the officers
but not many of the officers survived
can we ask those people who they trust
the people you know people that you know
yes yes i'll ask the officers to pick
there are three officers that i trust
and i'll ask them to pick
each five men perfect works for me
you know their first pick is going to
completely overlap though
it's all going to be like ted teddy
likes that guy
yeah he will not fail you um
he's the true villain so uh
you yeah you now there's there's a
slightly uncomfortable scene
as taro has a talk with the three
officers and then just starts listing
off names
and telling those people to get on the
boat and they don't know like he doesn't
tell them what it's about
um and he waits until the men are on the
boat and then he says
i pull the fuel tank off
just disconnect it it's easier right
yeah yeah no you you're able to do that
and
um it is clearly not a popular move with
the sailors and taro is
um he tells you that he's explaining and
having the officers explain
that you are going to get help and that
you will be back
uh and um
and and and it seems like a little
bit of professionalism
uh if that term is applicable here has
kicked in and these guys are like
okay we're gonna you know the military
kind of
uh structure comes into place so um
so yeah you you are able to sail away
without a problem um
and you you make it uh
and during this voyage i'm actually
gonna say let's do skill checks
what yeah so
skill checks are the experience
mechanic in call of cthulhu so as the
players are making roles
they are putting a little check next to
every skill they make successfully
now they're gonna go through all the
skills that have checks on them
and they're gonna try and fail that role
if they fail that role
they get a d10 to that skill
uh so this is advancement of a sort um
usually in in the game mechanically it
happens
in between chapters and this is sort
of a a chapter break
so we're gonna let them do that let
me know by the way if anybody gets a
skill
over 90. you don't have to worry about
that
uh no there are a couple that could get
there i mean
i'm getting close with knife yeah my
spot is 86 right now
i just want to make sure for the record
zero zero zero is 100 right
yes yep great time to roll 100
uh you can't use inspiration on on
skill checks
ah and again if you fail the role
you get a d10 to that skill nice
i didn't quite i get to get to 90 with
fighting knife but i'm three away
of all the times to roll that 97.
oh god i am making all of these just to
talk more about the mechanics if you get
a skill tonight
you have demonstrated mastery and you'll
nice are you sure because my spot hidden
is pretty close and i don't the things i
see
really don't give me sound oh man you're
not wrong though
you're gaining sanity only to lose it
yep
that was a waste the first aid's at 55
now man it's like you use that a lot
i don't know why we would funny how that
works
okay
i've really not done very many skills
i've not done well with my skills lately
i've had so many skills it's so good to
finally get to you
yeah that could that could be a good
episode title
what i've done as well with my skills
lately
yikes okay
navigate to shanghai i just want to like
have clothes made
and eat food is that okay sounds good to
me
we've got some other problems brought to
us
or local i it's really bad for us to go
out
once we get to shanghai although nick
does know a good
a good tailor no but taylor would
talk
you can't he did work for madame lin
that is true
um we have so
what day would we so we went to the
island the night of the third
yeah no it's it's the night of the third
right now so we would arrive
you're gonna get into shanghai the
morning of the of the fourth
okay so we have and the eighth
is when there's a full moon i'm just
saying if we wanted to put a capstone on
a volcano
we got four days we're not getting on
that island
we aren't we're gonna have to cap other
things
like wide camp other things like
pyramids
yeah pyramids or yeah so we're going
back to each other toys
i don't want to get on another boat
across the you oh
yeah we should really switch to planes
yeah because there's no way someone can
swat us out of the sky
i've heard stories that say otherwise
yeah how are we gonna get a gorilla on a
plane
oh that's a good question at first
[Music]
i mean i'm all for taking a plane
because i can't do any more boat rides
so essentially in the 20s uh
there is not a link the himalayas
like you have to fly basically puddle
jumps
around southeast asia
um because planes cannot go over the
himalayas
and zeppelin's still in fashion they are
very much
you could nothing ever goes wrong with a
zeppelin
especially when i'm carrying grenades
are you
i always have a grenade in my basket uh
the the trick to that is that the um
the the customs checks to get on a blimp
are a little higher
and heavier than i need a monitor
too they wouldn't accept me without that
would be awesome
and a tiny hat see that they know
what why would i wear a tiny hat i'd
whack
a mustache he's not wearing wood anymore
yeah he gave the hat to taro sorry
it makes taro feel a little more in in
control
he's the captain now i was the captain
but i relinquished it out of respect for
his sacrifice
how about we just take a bunch of camels
across the desert back to egypt
is that possible i mean there we go um
you'd have to like get to the desert
unless you're done about the gobi desert
yeah that's what i'm talking about china
the old horse with no name
you're going the silk road is that what
yep the old silk road is i'm calling it
the old silk silk road
so where will the party gather to have
this conversation come up here what to
do next
we're on a boat we gathered time
and most of the people on the boat don't
speak english apparently yeah
so not at all entertained by my nonsense
um taro like doesn't really seem to care
about your next steps he's thinking
about his next steps
he does he does offer that you know if
you do want to come to japan
you know he could he could make a case
for you
i mean i i think it would be worth it
just to brief them
on the catastrophes
on the horizon for the entire planet
keep in mind
if they believe us great if they don't
believe us we are all crazy people that
they will
lock up or shoot we're all crazy people
and a talking gorilla
that's not great so to a certain extent
plus also japan to egypt
china to egypt whatever
at least the americans believe us so
we've got that small bit going for us
honestly i think our first step when we
when we get back to shanghai is find a
way to get word to rogers
we need to tell him what happened we
need to tell him how catastrophically
bad this went because he needs to be
aware of what we're dealing with
the kara siri and peru were bad enough
is he going to
like visibly flinch as i say that is
roger's going to send people to that
island to be slaughtered by the car
sorry
maybe either that or some people who who
know
more we need to finish this
sorry we need to finish translating the
scroll though before we move on
no agreed did you bring your translator
is you're trying to he's going to come
with us he's hanging with us
okay he's going on that island yeah he's
my buddy i mean we took him on the boat
we're buddies i mean i i'm even thinking
of asking if i could learn some chinese
from him we're gonna get him have an
idea
i have an operator proposal let's sit
tight finish translation when it's
complete
uh we we radio or telegraph to rogers
our exact locations on the world
and he'll do that magic thing that he
does
to open the portal where he abuses our
some of our former friends and as long
as we give him coordinates he can come
i'm not super keen on that hey
just here sorry continue your thought
and i'll
finish no okay you can stop there you're
not super keen okay not super keen on
that i'm just not super keen
speaking of not being keen on bad ideas
um where
in a lot of pieces yeah
so there's no portal back to the island
because that would be a super fast way
to like
would have been i was going to rip that
out and then the boat blew up
how did rogers create a portal
attaching people to a machine or
something that puts them into some sort
of
i don't want to say vegetative because
that would insinuate that they're not
suffering yeah he was he was able to
weaponize the the portal technology that
dr kafur dr gafford i remember that
right
yeah i i'm so bummed we couldn't
get there and help we through virtue of
our presence
killed penu
[Laughter]
okay i drink to that i'll drink it
what that happened to a worse fella
well and at least we have the issues
that you two had
with the the headdress remember that's
that's a win that's a huge win
not the only one cursed on the entire
party oh yeah we're gonna have to grab
that thing off of your neck
i i i'm ha the the offer to do makeshift
surgery is still open
maybe the americans have some now
i mean maybe the americans have
something maybe they have someone who's
well trained enough
in magical stuff to
sever sever the link look i met
i'm talking about all of this i met an
american military doctor
on my way to london oh good fellow that
guy
yeah you met doyle that's right no
no i met someone i did meet doylesson
someone else man what was his name what
was that guy's name oh
the kentucky fellow right yeah kentucky
friday [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
i think he's dead actually oh he's very
dead yeah
i'm just saying that's how far i trust
looking into the medicine that's being
developed
by them if if i can get a hold of
doyle's son i trust him to the end of
the world
but
roger's been fine darlson he knows where
he is i'm sure he could
absolutely but would he send him to us
and would we want to explain why
because i don't much relish that
conversation he's part of team b
i'm sure he knows a lot of information
i don't know maybe we keep that option
open because i would like to get
that thing removed from your neck not
worshiper of nergal and papanergal has
gifts for all
uh all right so you you uh
taro will give the the pilot
directions
and you pull up to a a warehouse
uh in in shanghai and he taro
immediately starts barking orders like
once you're kind of in this warehouse he
like is much more in his place
and like the the sailors are kind of
just like
okay we'll do whatever you say and um
he starts unpacking stuff there's
a box of curations so he makes sure
everybody has food
oh and um
and and you know there's cans of food
and that sort of thing and then uh
he says that he is gonna go out and and
uh he has to to get resources to get a
boat um
is there anything that you need when i'm
out
food clothes an elephant
rifle weapons grenades
i i don't know that a bicycle will be
helpful uh
i recall the last time i gave you a
bicycle it was not put to good use
i mean this is a big warehouse what am i
gonna do all day i'm just going to
bicycle around in here
is there anything serious that you
require
a large hat all right
uh i should warn you
no one else here speaks english so when
i'm gone
um these men know that you are
working with them and um
they will not hinder you in any way but
um
i i really don't think you should leave
the warehouse
you are all well known to madame lynn
yeah
generally stay ahead and stay out of the
way but let your men get their job done
sounds good all right as long as do
you have a crowbar and extra crowbar
around here
uh yes of course okay thank you also how
is my
non-human inflicted wounds doing
so you have not really had a night of
rest so
you don't want to put some gauze on it
is the question
i want to find a first aid kit and sure
yeah you have somebody who's quite
good at first aid
yeah what is your skill in it
my skill is now 55. oh yes i would like
that
girls needs first aid i do have first
aid but i'm only in the 40s
yeah who else because i'm good who else
knows
so emma needs it and and flint needs it
okay so i'll make first aid
and then i'm taking a nap why don't we
have i mean
you can try you so joan you start on
emma
you start on flint alexandria and then
if you don't make it we'll
yeah you know you guys all right yeah
oh nice so flynn you get three points
back and emma you also get
uh is 13 hard or critical hard
okay so emma you also get three points
back okay
so i'm almost i just leveled it up and
now there's a new check mark next to
that box again
i eat some i ate some canned beans and i
take a nap now
uh a nap sounds pretty good actually you
guys have been through it
um taro is gonna try he's hurrying as
much as he can
yeah when he shows up i can load the
boat up pretty
quickly with the stuff that's in the
warehouse
so about four hours pass and
you know you're just sitting in a
warehouse and there's like the
sailors
are like inventorying they're going
through all the boxes making sure
what's there taro is clearly
uh as um
as flint pointed out taro has clearly
told them to like
get everything ready so they can load
all of this on a boat quickly
like he asks once if he can go home
because you know he's home
i work so much better at home
it's not very safe for you therefore i'm
sorry
yeah people are looking for this
uh he kind of
he sighs in a sad manner
when when when i've gotten like an
hour's nap i'm i'm gonna be up and like
working through night like knife cottage
just to try and settle my head
after everything with the car series
yeah
yeah i'm going to sit with the
translator guy and you know it reassure
him
and say you know yes we want to get this
all over with get you back home but we
really need to do this or there will be
no home to get back to
like now
do we we have some we have some money
don't we guys
not a lot yeah no but
somebody blew most of it on a suit that
immediately got blown up
yeah well let's that was my own money
um so would if i wanted to give him some
money would i make a credit check to see
if i have any
you have you give him a little money and
he yes you know he's not used to seeing
that much money
so it's about you know
it's heading towards afternoon it is now
you know
two or three in the afternoon uh
and the sailors have finished most of
what they were doing and now they're
just kind of like
they're playing cards they're you know
um
they're wishing they could find alcohol
yeah
um you note that there is no alcohol in
i know i was like see a bicycle would
have been rice pretty nice right now
yeah and all of a sudden a door
nikes and and there
are like screams of panic from the
sailors who just critically failed a
sanity role
this door magically appears there and so
um there's kind of like all of you on
one end of the warehouse the door in the
middle
and a bunch of sailors hiding behind uh
uh crates some of them with machetes
all right i have that crowbar they gave
me yeah i i i was still working through
cottages and i'm just like turn and turn
around and immediately like
all right is it loud enough to wake me
up
uh the door doesn't make much noise well
then i'm still asleep
um and and the door opens
and you can towards you
and rogers steps out and
behind him you once again see that kind
of electric
chair setup that has sitting back to
back
dr kafur and yusef both their eyes like
milky white
just kind of twitching every once in a
while yeah i look at them and then look
away just like
yeah it's not a pretty sight it's not a
pretty sight and
uh rogers uh
rogers like comes right over to
uh god which one of you does he
yeah you want to talk to probably donald
that's he goes right up to donal
and and he's just like all right what's
the sit rep
all right well donald's fish including
the guns after all the sea salt and air
and whatnot so he puts his rag
because gun oil away and whatnot and
sits there and says
well the assault on the island failed
miserably we were
the ship we were in was attacked by some
sort of magical force destroyed the
destroyer entirely
what's worse is the other fellows we
sent in before us
um were turned into some sort of
horrible
zombie creatures or whatnot and they
roam the island the japanese
or the new china front so the new china
front walk out there first
uh their fate was determined before we
even
arrived they were the kids that was the
japanese
well the japanese the ship was destroyed
we have a few here with us that we're
gonna rescue the rest
and that's it and what blew up the ship
we don't know some sort of magical power
that broke the ship apart in midair
left it suspended for quite some time
we don't know well first number one is
we have to finish this ritual
translating this ritual
we have to create some objects which we
can use
to seal these ritual sites
once we have that completed we have to
find another way to get to these sites
cleanse the sites and then do the ritual
to permanently
can you guys hear this damn bird yes
[Laughter]
oh you maybe had a bird yeah there's
this
it's oh god i call it the 5am bird
apparently it's called a tui
yes yes oh that i wish cartoonish levels
of violence on that bird
i completely understand because it
sounds very familiar to birds that live
right outside of
my place and i'm like you know i have
three cats
yeah no i've i would throw penny at that
thing and just watch the devastation if
i could find oh god i hate that bird
um i have yeah
anyway yeah but i apologize for my
feathered friend uh
i think it's i think i shamed it and
decided rachel's really hungry one of
the two i can't tell
look i could take that translator
and we can we can work on weaponizing
that ritual
we can mass produce this thing well
we'll we can finish the translation in a
few days and give you
a copy and at that point of course your
people can
can make multiple versions of it we but
let the fella finish his job first
he's been going through quite an ordeal
already he could finish his job with us
oh he's almost finished i think joan
joan yeah yeah how long do you think to
that fellow can finish that translation
um don't i haven't gotten a a a good
idea of how long it's gonna take him
but but the thing is is that if if
you know he
he he we promised him to get back to his
family as soon as possible so he's
working as hard as he can
to get that done and so i'll i'll
whisper to the guys
what do you think what do you think how
long do you think it's going to take you
they want to take you away
um and i want you to keep you so you
want to take me away
how long how long do you think you got
left
oh man he stands up he fails the sanity
roll
oh geez who wants to i'm
you can't take me away see told you
rogers you can't take him away
let's just how long how long do
you think it'll be a translator
who's gonna take me away look look look
this is the deal
we need to have this done our bosses
want to have this done
right away but we want to keep you with
us
rogers is just like watching all of this
with thinly veiled contempt
yeah well i'm not paying attention to
him
i mean all my attention's on my guy
i i think i'm very close but sweet
i mean this in the nicest possible way
everywhere i've gone with you has tried
to get me killed i don't want to go
anywhere with you
let's just finish the job here in this
warehouse and then you can go home
yes but you're getting a boat to sail
away from here i'm not getting on
another boat with you
right and that's why you need to finish
it now
just just put your head down finish it i
promise
that you'll get to go home after that
[Music]
would you like to make me a social skill
role of some sort jones let's see
yes let's see let's see let's see offer
me a roll
oh yeah i got a heart on that all right
yeah
you you know you you have eye contact
your
your your you know your calm
and all that stuff so he's
like i mean i feel like
um if i have calm
and a and a place to work and
things aren't blowing up or being
disassembled or
that really loud lady i feel like
you know we're here in this warehouse
and a half
two days right now okay i look at
alexandria we both look at each other
like which
[Laughter]
yeah we're both like i don't think he
meant us but it might he might have been
meeting us i think he means the duchess
could be i hope i tell him
another year and a half and we'll have
the translation for you
um no problem if this fellow gets
disturbed we have to start the whole
process over which would
have set us back we don't need that
so this is this is a ritual
that can seal these areas
right we have a preliminary translation
that we can show to you right now so you
can see what we're working with here
and it shows it talks about the what
what to do in this particular ritual
and how he'll happily take that if you
want to give that to him
so i'll show you let's make a copy for
him make a copy
yeah yeah he he's he's very interested
in that
he's like all right i'm going to get
i'm going to get my guys in our in
virginia to look at this
and see if we can't do with this what
we did with
huh you know that um
i have to say that that that business
uh professor lam that business with uh
uh
being magical batteries that was that
was really a breakthrough for us thank
you for telling us about that
yes as well it's really helped
our efforts it's been a a big
and did yusuf say it was okay to use him
as a battery
and we've been over this no he didn't
i didn't ask yeah that was i understand
that but that's that's the whole point
so i understand i'm just gonna stop you
right there and remind you
that the whole point is stopping the end
of the world
we're all the same we're on the same
team here rogers
rogers will like look at you with a
if we aren't now would be a good time to
tell me that
we're on the same team we might not
always do things exactly the same way
but we're on the same team
methods differ but we have the same goal
i i have a question do we have the means
to cleanse that island before we return
what do you mean by cleanse uh
i mean i can see if i can get some
support from the air force
we are delta green is
technically paramilitary we're not uh
we don't really have the resources of
the mill of the us military they
they have very politely helped us out
but i can ask
there is some good news what's that
oh that fellow are you familiar with a
samson fella
[Music]
carl stanford stanford yeah one of those
things i have quite a file on carl
stanford
well stafford's in charge now of the
other side he's the opposition
at this point he killed he he killed
penhoe
he killed penu yes you know
we have found that often
one of the best ways to deal with these
idiots is just wait for them to kill
each other
i mean that's certainly one one part one
uh
one outcome of it but we have found that
a lot of
uh power gets transmitted from a
sacrifice
and it's entirely possible that stanford
just got a lot stronger
but there's only one of him and not him
and penu it's a little more concentrated
i see all right well i'm going to get
this translation
to my boys in arlington and i'm going
to glance over at donald and raise a
question in eyebrow if he
basically asking do we want to do the
i'll ask rogers if you happen to have a
fancy doctor on your staff perhaps a
consultation
um what's
are you do you have a disease what's
going on here
well i'd just like to have a medical
professional look at something and see
if it can be removed
i'm going to let me get a look at donald
just like tilt my head and say
if you have a surgeon who is capable in
in and around the the spinal cord that
would be very useful
right and someone who's um
cleared for this sort of information
i'm gonna need a lot more than that if
i'm
to be putting resources towards
something like this
what do you need a consult for what's
wrong with your spine
uh i had something um
burned or attached or something onto my
spine a foreign
entity i don't know what it does but by
stanford he like takes a step back from
you
you've got some carl stanford put
some sort of parasite in you or
something we don't know what it is but
it's a mark
and what i mean what's it gonna do
and you want me to see if i can find
someone who can cut it off of you
i'll you know we've got
we have at least one occult surgeon on
staff
i'll see what he what he thinks
um are you going to be at this warehouse
for a little while
um probably i believe we're leaving
by this evening if we can maybe we
should just stay
actually that's a good point donald do
we need to go what what use are we going
to be out in the ocean with a
we're just taking up seats on a boat
they need to rescue yeah we should stay
that's true yeah good call good call yes
i agree so we'll be here
uh all right well then i will
this translation is my first priority
but after that
do you do you people need anything else
in the way of support
where's your accountant grey dragon
island
we've lost him so you know how you're
using poor yosef
as a battery that's what stanford's
stanford has one of our assets
and yes and we can't get out of the
island
how does he not know everything we're
doing
i'm sure he knows a lot well and and
and sylvana wasn't around for a lot
of what's going on now
god damn well your friend
is as good as dead anyway
right so we will need some access to
more funds
in the future
what can you get us we've got some uh
we've got some slush fund that you can
tap into i'll just need a requisition
form
i'm sure one of us can fill that out
give us the form we'll fill it out
i suppose all right let's plan on
re on reconvening here
tomorrow at noon
tomorrow noon all right
he steps through the door close and
close and the door closes and disappears
so and i'm gonna go over and like nudge
it takes a a heck of a nudge
poke poke how the monkey's dreaming huh
i i think the biggest question that we
have to answer is where we're going now
yeah because i i don't
i i don't think that we're needed out on
that boat
do you agree we told them that we were
going to help right with what we are
at the rescue what do we need to do
they they they get the ship there and
they're they're able to you know lower a
lifeboat honestly they're probably safer
without us there
we are a beacon for trouble
and i think we can persuade him of that
i
i think less bad things can get to us
there
than here i don't want to stay here
i don't want him to go next where's our
next destination
question japan why
safe place to do the ritual make a
capstone
this is a question how many capstones
do we need
how many flights do we have to or
well we we want to do the one in egypt
we want to do gray dragon island
uh and australia what we found
did we find a pyramid structure for some
we did some research for the bloated
woman here right
yeah so you have remember on the um
in the pyramid you saw that triangle
that had the three
points to it that were gray dragon
island
somewhere here and uh
in australia yeah and then you have um
egypt egypt and possibly something in
kenya you're not sure
probably in kenya although we've been
told not to go to kenya because people
is that five the five locations we need
but we capped peru yep
right so there's four more is what
you're saying each location's um
um sign has to be particular to that
location or unique to that
location i believe from the from the
translation
um so i don't know if it really makes
sense for us to make
five of these stones and just bring them
with us
yeah the only thing that we have on hand
is the
egyptian one so we have to go back to
egypt is essentially
to seal the pyramid the red pyramid that
that is a good point though
rogers was talking about weaponizing
this ritual there's no way to weaponize
it unless
um you're able to make something very
specific for each area
and i mean that's not unheard of i'm
sure
he has more researchers than we do to
find out
yeah if someone told rogers he'd just be
spun the blood of innocence
for the heck of it i have a thought
a thought of the five locations which
is the the least dangerous
[Laughter]
australia's got all the the the critters
there that australia has everything
that's trying to kill us in the natural
world and that's not even touching the
water
exactly exactly theoretically egypt you
know
you've killed chris
yeah you've killed knight of chris we
as a test run so we know how to do it in
a
somewhat safe location and if it works
then we
can go to other locations and that are
more difficult
i'm just more comfortable getting
transportation
from japan rather than from here at some
point we're gonna have to go out and
we're gonna have to move quick before
madame len spots us and descends upon us
well theoretically if if we if we stay
here
we're gonna rogers is going to be
back and meeting us here at noon
tomorrow
okay that being the case we can ask him
to transport us directly to egypt
no boat ride none of that no dealing
with madame lin
never even leave the warehouse really if
we do go to japan though we do
have the opportunity to make a case for
more allies who might be able to
go and scout out some of the other areas
at like
potentially go to uh
and look at this go and be more human
sacrifices for us
yeah oh no just just look into what the
capstone
looks like just to research it we're
gonna draw attention i'm going to draw
attention
and you know the japanese military could
try and you know attack grey dragon
island again
yeah oh that went well taro might
oh man i don't know i'm not good at
persuading political people to
to follow us i think the rest of you
feel like you make a good case
i think we would might make things
worse i think to some
extent i am a good case
like if they want to know that there is
there are unnatural things out there
that we should be concerned with i'm
i'm pretty good proof of that
rogers didn't see flint did he
he has seen flint since he was a gorilla
okay
all right honestly i i think
that as much as i dislike everything to
do with rogers
i think he's our best bet to do the
research while
putting people who have actually signed
up for this into
into the job i am not comfortable asking
people
who are tenuous allies at best who go
and possibly die
yeah again yeah no we need to have the
real
i'm like you were there at the boat with
us
again just translate
the translation i'm right there with him
up at that at this point the sailors
start to like
become active and you can clearly
hear
a large ship docking outside the
warehouse
and they start to get moving we need to
make some decisions and we need to make
them now
well i'll i mean i've made my case i'm
going to go help them load up the boat
let me know what you all decide fair
enough
we stay here with the translator let him
finish the translation to protect it
until he finishes it
no i agree i i agree i agree on that we
need to stay here with him and then
but then what do we do next egypt egypt
i think we we we do what we can to
solidify the places that we've already
been we've
dealt with peru and now we deal with
with egypt
as best as we can and we already have we
have the two pieces yeah because
that's the one we have the two pieces
for that one
we don't have to carve anything we just
put it back together and
i don't know maybe someone here can
teach us that that method of fusing
things together with gold
the japanese know you're not you're not
here flind you're helping carry things
go
point the point being i think that we
close as many doors behind us as we can
before we go trying to open new ones
and dealing with whatever explodes on us
on that side
sounds good flint you are outside
you know you go outside with them oh no
uh
it is raining but weirdly the sky
does not seem like super dark or
anything
and taro uh
uh like will see you and he'll say
what do you make of that and
in the sky oh
is um
it kind of looks like a rainbow
but it's a rainbow made of water
and it seems to go from somewhere in
shanghai
as far as you can see towards gray
that place that place in shanghai is
that approximately
where the bloated lady yes
okay i will finish
putting this down where it needs to go
all right yeah run in i'm kind of
standing there
out of breath not sure how to put this
flint what what's going on is it
we we we might need to find the pyramid
here and cap it first
come outside okay yeah i i i i
have a dagger in hand as i follow him
just automatically
so outside it is raining but the sky
is clear
uh and you see yeah you see clearly
water rainbow it's like a it's like a
column of water
or a cone of water that emanates
or or one one point of it is hofang's
compound
and the other point is out of your view
but it's definitely in the direction of
gray dragon island
shoot is she going there or something
coming here
do we know where her pyramid is flint
you know maybe but flint you were you
were
inside of that temple for longer than i
was was there
anything that might have that kind of a
maybe maybe that temple is is at the
compound
that that was where we woke her it seems
it seems reasonable
there's a fountain maybe maybe stanford
travels on a cone of water that would be
funny but please
that's completely what emma thinks emma
thinks like stanford just shoots through
the water do we think the bloated woman
was
we did research on that but i don't
remember that because i think that was
mostly silvano
so there were pyramids that were
found
uh you you you found like a super old
temple
in in japan in in shanghai sorry um
you don't you didn't really look
anything about ho fang's place
and the history of it
dorian i wonder if there's a reason
behind
where ho fang built it was a very
interesting location and that fountain
was
fascinating he seems to be tied to water
which means we need to make the cap oh
gods we don't know
we're hoping that that translation will
full moon is another couple days right
no i don't want to be your gorilla
friend
not i don't want to be your gorilla i
can't do it because i'm not a human
anymore
donald's going to be the gorilla no he
is not
the problem being is whatever this mark
is on my back i don't know if
that could be trouble if you have a
gorilla
yeah biscuits speaking of though let's
get inside
people who say yes yep yep well i'm
gonna go back to hauling things
all right yeah so about six o'clock
the boat is ready to go and taro comes
in
uh and and he says
you know i understand if you do not wish
uh do not wish to accompany me uh
this may be the last time we see each
other if that's the case
i do feel as if if you came to japan
i could make a case to uh
that this is something that they should
deal with
i can't promise that they would listen
but i'm an intelligence officer
and if we if we could frame it in terms
of
its potential impact on
our actions in china
split the party no
that would be the party splits of all
parts they're on different continents
yeah no we we would have to like have
separate sessions
yeah there's no way be team 18
basically i'm not a b team now but i
don't have a c team character
yeah we need to stay
and make sure that we get the
translations
of this material that's the only way
we're gonna be able to do anything
so we need to stay here for this this is
this might be a bit meta
like
no like split in all seriousness would
go to japan
that's what i'm saying and that your new
character would then kill madame lynn so
we'd have two oh my god that would be
amazing
oh that's a horrible idea wonderful
let's do it
so if you think that flint would go to
japan
then we can come up with you know we can
make you a new character
based around this you could even we
could make the translator a character if
you wanted
oh the poor thing oh no no i'd run him
in the ground he's already so close
too poor poor translator seems pretty
stable
uh but i mean he's he's a professor
he's
he's a learned man not after i got
through with him he'd be the best
but but that is to say that there are
plenty of opportunities
for if you if you think that flint
would
would do that and that and that also
doesn't necessarily mean that's the end
of flint
yeah in any good pulp story there's
always the
the re-emergence of a a lost hero
at some point no it it might make sense
too you know if you wanted to go and
help persuade
um that this was a thing that needed to
be done but we
we can't all go there like at least not
right now i mean maybe we can meet him
there later
but not right now anyone can convince
them like
like i i think we're parting ways
makes sense wow is there a tiny hat i
can give him on his way
did carl bring me a large hat yes he
brought you
he brought you the hat you asked for
that's perfect for the rain
um taro is surprised but he's
he's he's very happy
you know he he he is he's you know he
he know this is not going what we're
gonna do is not gonna be
easy and i'm very glad to not
have to do it alone um
i hope that you will come to love japan
as much as i do i
i'm looking forward to it actually
it feels like a fresh start since my
whole world got turned upside down
[Music]
i actually have not been a gorilla for
very long
um my english is not always so good
so i didn't really understand that
sentence you have not
been a gorilla for very long no
geez not even a i don't think it's even
been a week
no god this has been a horrible week
this has been a horrible week but i
think uh
it's been a week it's literally been
like seven days now
i think yeah i think i'm optimistic i
very well my friends thank you
for your help and and thank you for uh
your not totally sporadic
care for my men but i appreciate
that you tried to save as many of
them as you could
can we can we hang out in this in
your warehouse for a little bit of
course
of course this warehouse is um
owned by a uh
a shell company of mine and
uh it you are well provisioned here
yes thank you but please
don't tell anyone this location
of course it's
they're they're there's material here
that would uh
uh in greatly that would greatly
incriminate
uh the japanese military and
would make clear are
that forces in china would not
appreciate
it would make your involvement here very
clear yes
sure fair enough yes it it would
this is farewell perhaps we'll see you
again
i hope so here we go and go over and put
a hand up unflinched
on flint's arm and be like take care of
yourself you big lummox
i'm going to bring thorn castle that
elephant gun of his that i've removed
the trigger guard for
i won't blow this one up
it'll take good care of your phone i
know you'll be fine we'll see you again
pretty soon thorn castle
hopefully you all don't
don't get killed we'll try
it's good we'll try but i mean you know
you know what a richard stone castle
you've got roger's contact information
that you want to send a telegram to the
american
military i know i know a pilot who owes
me a favor
i might reach out to him first
[Laughter]
uh all right so yeah at this point uh
flynn and
uh taro and the the 15 crewmen will get
on
um i wasn't gonna cry i know
like a medium-sized freighter it has
more than enough space
uh to carry the the guys on the island
um and it they will
they will sail off to go and rescue
their men
um do you um
getting full meta here is there is
there a character
that you that is sort of in this that
you have seen that you want to
take over or um
do you we can you know it's very easy to
bring someone into the orbit
uh yeah if they're gonna be if they're
gonna
go through a magical door it opens up
all sorts of possibilities for
yeah yeah you can have anybody
i never got to make that cat character
in d d
hi lucy uh
the yeah so we you can think about
that
and we can we can deal with that before
next saturday and we can introduce the
new character then
uh one of my favorite things is just
lucy like will just sort you can just
sort of hold her like
like him like this and he doesn't know
he's like i don't know how to
get out all right
he does do a lot of cocaine not just no
but
hell no he knows things yeah
he knows things someone who's in
crowley's orbit maybe
crowley crowley's lawyer and a lot of
sorcery
i i actually i do
have an idea it's a bad idea for a
character
i tend to like those so maybe i
shouldn't
that's why you're on character number
three man
yeah oh it's an awful idea for a
character i'm gonna i'm gonna
shoot it by ezra later and he can tell
you know what you're too widgety right
now see
on your way on your way sir on your way
on your way
uh so the four of you that are left
um unless you have anything else you
want to do we're going to zip ahead to
noon when roger's
on this will pop out of that door and
then and that'll be may 5th that he
arrives
yes no i i just i just wanted to see
what
where did we get before the the night
when we went to sleep i mean i i
imagine that the he's gonna have to
sleep a little bit
oh yes he will sleep so he's
he's feels like he's gotten through most
most of the pages about the ritual
um he's now now just sort of trying to
get to the end
to make sure that nothing else comes up
that sort of con you know
that creates context that will change
things um
he's heartened that you didn't get you
know make him get on the boat again
yep that did a great deal for his
sanity
good so at noon uh
and you know uh
i don't know what your next step is but
as long as you don't have any ethical
qualms and he stares at
several of you the door
i think we're going back to egypt unless
there's any other ideas fellas
we're talking about staying here and
trying to figure out where to camp
here yeah have we like peeked outside
and seen if that rainbow is still there
it's still there yeah i'm i'm actually
going to like is there any way we can
show him
i'm going to like pull him you could
like yeah oh
yeah let's let's show him i'll i'll pull
rogers over to the door and and say
that's as of yesterday god damn
yeah what is that we think it has to do
with the bloated lady aspect of
the one whose name i won't say
and where's the other end gray dragon
island
we believe well that's not
good so we are thinking that that we're
going to have to
remain here and try to get the cap
onto wherever we can find a cap this off
which is it's going to take us some
research to figure out where that is
well i've got a couple guys working
on that ritual that you came up with
we've got some ideas in terms of
synthetic blood
um well we don't know
that would be very innocent if you make
blood that's very innocent
our first step was you know we're gonna
try it with with
animal blood yeah but
but mccann animals be truly innocent
since they don't have the capacity for
evil
i'm not a theologian i don't know i
don't care i just want it to work
there's there's plenty of philosophy
that's built into magic stuff so
you may or may not be a theologian or a
philosopher but it's something that your
people will have to think about
we're also thinking about just
raiding blood banks
that might work as well hard to tell
what's
uh innocent at that point though well
so we're we're working on that
part of it we're also
if we had what one of these
you know we've got a a slight
description of this eye of light of
darkness but if we had like a full
description
we could just start mass producing them
well but according to what was on that
paper they can't all be the same
right you can't mass produce
it has to be specific to where it's
going
well maybe your translation will give
more
maybe it has to be more craftsmanship
um but that that's the main thing we're
working on right now is
this ritual has taken top priority if
this
if this can seal stuff off if we can
we can make this happen so
well once we get this translated um
and we're gonna need to do a little bit
more
on that then we're gonna be able to do
the uh
um we need to do a little bit more uh
research on how to
cap and what to cap we have some
theories
um but i do i do believe with with my uh
my friends here that
yeah we're gonna have to fix this before
it gets uh
gets away from us so we we need to do
research
on any sites in shanghai that are
uh connected to the the bloated ladies
in the same way that the
red pyramid red pyramid is is
the bent pyramid excuse me is is
i see something that is a high holy site
for her
all right do you want my men to
you want me to have some men look into
that that would be awesome if you could
get
give us a boost up on that that would be
very very very helpful
so because we're not exactly
um welcome here anymore so going to
the library and such like that would not
be a good thing
how do you lose a gorilla he
you let a delta green agent
be put into the hands of the imperial
japanese
they are working with with the
information that taro
has has gathered who is an information
officer
they are working to persuade imperial
japan that this is actually a threat
so that we can have more allies and more
resources from around the world
and sending a gorilla over there seemed
like a good way to
show them that this was real a gorilla
who was
once a human and speaks perfect english
we didn't send him it wasn't our
call he he volunteered for this yes and
how do you propose stopping a thousand
pound gorilla who has his mind made up
on something
he's he's he he believes that this is
the best way
that that he can help right now and i
trust his instincts
lucy's playing with the birds of
paradise good kitty
right he knows the birds he knows
am spray nice goblin get him
yeah lucy was a big fan so
um i mean if he chose
let's be clear and and if you can
communicate to him to this to him in
some way
you can't ever let the japanese know
and if i think that someone
is telling the japanese about delta
green i have to deal with that
understood
because
there we're trying to save the world
here
but there's more at risk the world is
at risk in so many different ways with
everything that's going on
is it not just um
all of the elder gods and all of that
happy crappy
i mean we've got werewolves in england
we've got headless people in egypt and
it's delta green's mission
well right now our our priority
and i mean we don't have the same reach
or power that you do but our priority is
making sure that there is a world
[Music]
and we're we're unified in that and
all right and concannon you wanted
to talk to uh
uh oh nick you could be the occult doc
ooh bringing a doctor that would be
awesome
what is the occult doctor's name nick i
have no idea if i'm gonna
no no but you're gonna name him
regardless oh if you ask me for a name
on the fly it's always gonna be frank
frank right
what's his last name dr frank dr frank
frank franklin frank sinatra
pranks
his name i think i've actually got
something
open with frank's salon appropriate
names
i'm looking at the oh where'd it go i
just had a page open
oh hold on oh
uh frank hollister hollister all right
and if you don't mind he'd like to
take you back to dc and take a look at
you
all right and i'll be able to return
i'll i'll do it anything you
before i enter the door anything we
should discuss about us
uh we're we're gonna be here we'll be
here when you get back take care of
that
all careful well i've left before
and i came back so you'll be back i'll
be back again
all right so you and dr hall should
go through we're gonna deal with that
off camera
uh as we dealt with the the curse
business
so the three of you the ladies of the
great dane society
uh are you're in this warehouse with
this one poor translator guy
uh are you rogers will actually
actually after hollister and and uh
donald lee
rogers asks if you need anything else
or if there's anything grenades guns
clothes food what what
what was i telling you before their
did they talk they're still okay
there's still supplies here yeah okay
well then i need a nice help
a bicycle how am i gonna get around
all right we can we can make that happen
so what are you gonna do in shanghai
research
i think mostly well you're going to help
us with some of that right
we've got some research yeah yeah we've
got some research for you
i'm going to work with the the
translator make sure that we have that
information
um and then i'm going to keep studying
it and that's what i'm going to do
well as as soon as you have that
translation make sure that we get a copy
well and and if the translation tells us
what sort of symbol to use for
the the bloated lady honestly all of
their capping
we will start getting those made or pass
it off to you to have those made
as the case may be yep all right
all right well uh
okay you gotta write that down as one of
the things that we have heard tonight
that's a great quote if uh
if you need anything else uh
i would not hear that no send a telegram
um it is now evening in shanghai
okay so now that rogers is gone we gotta
go see what's up at the ho fang place
you're not wrong i could breathe in
water
well my my issue my issue was more that
flint told us that something was trying
to drag people
into that temple and i'm not i don't
know about you guys but i'm not strong
enough to fight that
i'm not but totally not what is what
does it take does it take con
who could physically resist it was flint
who was a gorilla
so unless one of us wants to go and kill
madame lin and become a gorilla
ah well what else can we do um
we are gonna have to if we're probably
gonna have to go in there and get the
cap
but and i can do the ritual to make it
so that you can
go in water well i suppose the question
really is do we think
that it's worth the danger of going in
there when we're not
sure if that's the spot i mean every
time someone's gone in there it's gone
badly
i wasn't gonna go in i was just gonna go
around go to the
we'll go to the wall and see if the
rainbow actually lands
in their yard sure i don't i'm not i
can't leave the translator here by
himself
i mean we still have these binoculars
okay what are you proposing then joan
well i'm gonna stay here and and and
make sure that this gets done and then
make and make a copy so we can give it
out to
with me my crowbar there's no way this
can go wrong
nope so what kind of disguise clothes
are in the warehouse that i can put on
uh there's a number of japanese military
uniforms
no you find jack like like trench
coats and hats
yeah something to like pull it over and
find trench coats and hats
so are you gonna just take a cab to ho
fang's place
why do you think i wanted the bicycle
people how far away are we from ho
fang's place at this point
pretty good walk it would be miles
um i i think we
walk about a mile away and then get a
cab
back to the bicycles
as he does that the door opens and like
one bicycle rolls out of the door the
door closes
water double yeah let's ride double i
was would say
to make sure don't get my trench coat
caught in the the chain
uh all right so you start biking in the
rain through saying
we have to wait till it's dark though we
have to wait until it's like
dark dark dark like so this is pretty
pretty southerly and it's may so
um it gets dark around
and you ride out and uh
it's still raining and and windy it's
not
it's not fun to ride but you make
it
up remember ho fangs is up a hot up
on a hill
uh you you walk the bike up the hill uh
no fun doing two people on one
bike up a hill
uh one bike anyway yeah
especially old bikes and then so you
um you make it up there and it's clear
that that column of water
uh
area there that that area it it doesn't
it's not like it's completely with the
four walls
it seems like it's mainly over the house
so i have a couple questions two and two
they're in kind of two categories
everybody is there anybody that we've
passed
and how are they reacting to what's
happening oh yeah people
do not in i mean people do not enjoy
this
they're you know everyone is looking up
at it and like
you know making superstitious symbols
and things like that
and then what does it seem like like if
i had to describe it in great detail or
sketch it out
does it look like it's a cylinder and
the inside
is like a transportation tube is it like
a
tornado of you know what is like how
would you describe it
basically okay like a a tornado on that
that
is that is not you know the usual
tornado is sort of
a triangle that we think of but it's not
like that this is a
solid cylinder but inside the water
is just
royal is roiling okay and there's not
it's just
water so it's you don't see anything
else in there
okay nothing's floating around nothing's
okay but
as you and now that you're close enough
that cylinder
is quite large it is you know the size
of hofang's mansion
so it's you know several thousand square
feet
yeah all all like as soon as we get
there are there many people around or
are people like giving this place a wide
berth
people do not want to be near this i
don't blame them all right i'm going to
start doing a circle around the house as
much as i can
you know dodging around the the cliff
drop off
sure make me a luck roll that's a
sentence
good thing the person who knows how to
breathe in water didn't come
yeah 40 made it
all right yeah no problem you don't see
anybody as you're going around
um you do go around and um
it is totally silent like there's no
like
running water noise or anything like
that um
it is just you can't you need to
climb over the wall to really get a
sense
of it but it it does seem like this is
pretty much
the exact size of the mansion
all right so i'm gonna i'm gonna finish
the circle and come back around to emma
and make that report and just be like
i wonder and i'm gonna throw a rock into
it
yes first off yes obviously
second off i wonder if this was her
burial place
like the bent pyramid was for the
black
pharaoh if this is there if there was
something here
that got buried and sealed away
or you know where wherever wherever that
is for her
is what we need to find and this feels
i still think this is a tube of
transportation
you might not be wrong and i'll actually
like bend down and pick up a
a rock and get close enough to the
wall to see if i can hook it over
all right so you wing a rock at the
column and
um when you
you throw the rock it goes into the
roiling water
and there's like that that ripple in the
pond
kind of thing but
the ripple kind of keeps turning in on
itself and so there's this just this
constant like
quivering and the the column actually
almost
are you guys doing anything so did it
seem like
the though so the rock didn't pass
through the rock is just
in there somewhere rock seems like it is
in there yeah
okay
hmm so about that
the the the tube of water is now like
oscillating and you can see it
oscillating
how much do we want to piss off what's
in there
what are we going to send down it i'm
i'm just saying big water slide to
gray dragon island that's what i'm
thinking it doesn't look like it's going
anywhere though the rock is still
in the same spot where it landed just
wiggling
i also don't want this thing to expand
like if we shoot something into it
like and it starts to do it starts to
sway back and forth and envelop more of
the city
sure it does does it seem like it's
still pretty well anchored
in hofing's compound the the base of it
is stable the oscillation
starts above it so it is it more like a
slinky
that's a great yeah yeah that's a great
okay i mean
that's a fair point i honestly don't
think that i would say a grenade
would be enough to blast this apart
although i'd love to see it try
one way to find out i brought one
of course you did am i going to enable
an emma idea
i don't know anything about physics but
i think that that would be bad
probably if if me next episode i don't
perfect yeah i'm i'm not very strong
and it it's wibbling like that from a
rock that i threw at it
i feel like anything stronger might
turn into a whip that lashes across the
sky i don't i don't i don't know i don't
uh it seems like the oscillation is
slowly
uh increasing it's getting bigger
yes
i'm like where's the bike let's get out
of here before we so there's almost like
now there's like almost a jump rope
effect happening
where it's like starting to like whip
like this and it's it's looking like
it's larger than it is
because of the like jump rope effect
is it taking anything is there anything
in the air that's taking it taking it
with it like is it picking up
tree leaves and things no there's no
suction or anything like that
okay
am i bad that i want to throw another
rock at it
[Laughter]
yeah because what happens if it starts
to whip around and like somehow
dislodges like we get
like i don't want to play jump rope with
a with a with a
whirlpool tornado of water no no it's a
terrible idea i've been hanging around
you too long
uh at that point you start to hear
rumbling from hofang's mansion just like
it sounds you know it sounds awful all
the world like a house being shaken
apart
is there anything nearby that i can
climb to like look over the wall
sure you can find a tree yeah i wanna i
wanna i'm gonna climb the tree
and have a look over the wall i got the
bike i'm ready to go
i'm ready to roll i got the kick stand
up so
alexandria climbs a tree meanwhile
um so you climb the tree
and you you see that that oscillating
column of water that's going back
and forth
and and it looks like the base where it
is
is starting to like be shifted back and
forth
and torn and torn and
as you are watching you
see um
you see a uh
sort of get sucked up and go
and then there is a there's a final like
rending crack and the house
it just kind of ceases to be and all of
a sudden
the column of water becomes
the bloated woman and you essentially
see the bloated woman
following that rainbow towards gray
just like and and not even quickly just
slowly being like
almost almost like a zeppelin just sort
of traveling across
and all that's left of hofang's mansion
is just a a ruin of the foundation
of the place but the but to be
clear
the building itself didn't get taken
like the building is destroyed
and i think that's where we're gonna end
so that's gonna do it for quests and
cthulhu uh
thanks again for joining us we really
appreciate it
uh you can you can find all of our bat
if you if you just started watching you
can find all of our back episodes on
youtube
uh we have a playlist we also play
dungeons and dragons
begrudgingly sometimes on monday
mondays and tuesdays this monday
we have dungeons dragons and rick and
morty
tuesday we have a much better night uh
tom is going to be running cthulhu in
space
uh finishing up the traditional
question chaos one shot that becomes a
several shot
and yeah we really had fun let's see
tonight's quotes
for the for the title
we have fyi i will give up very
easily
uh i've not done well with my skills
lately
we're all crazy people in a talking
gorilla
speaking of not super keen on bad ideas
we are a beacon for trouble i think it's
a great title
i don't want to be your gorilla friend i
like that one
oh god this has been a horrible week
am i going to enable an emma idea and
i don't want to play jump rope with a
whirlpool
there are some good some good choices
there uh
i think we're all crazy people in
a talking gorilla is my
my current favorite because it excludes
the gorilla as being one of the crazy
normalest of us well
and and now he's going now that's that's
