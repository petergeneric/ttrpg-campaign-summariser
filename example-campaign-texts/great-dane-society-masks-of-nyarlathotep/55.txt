you know so do i that you had hanging
around
uh so the huge giveaway
we're gonna draw in october the
beginning of october is my understanding
like the the start of the month of
october
so you have the full month of september
because august is over because august
was simultaneously
eight years long and 40 seconds long i
don't know how that worked it was
non-euclidean but
uh august came and went and yet lasted
forever
it was a fascinating month um

finish watching this quality program
and go right into king sumo
and do whatever you're gonna do
uh we have as always a full week
of fine entertainment here for you here
at quests and chaos
monday it's dragon of ice spire mountain
and again only one dragon
like if there's more than one dragon
they should have changed the title
that's
and i'm you know who knows what level
what level are you guys going to end up
being if that
i am told that we will end at level
while when we're level five
uh the the it's it's the adventure from
the essentials kid that's designed to
take people from levels one to five
does anybody playing d d anymore
actually do experience
yes who that was
man that was my favorite part when we
played back
back in the day first edition like you
kept track of your kills
and then the gm would be like every
goblin is seven experience you're like
well i got four of those three and a
half of those
you know boy kill stealing would be way
more of a thing if that were still the
case treasure too gave you experience
yeah treasure you got to experience for
treasure it was oh it was the best we
would
we would like that was like
that was the the main min maxing we did
was figuring out how i could kill
how i could get the kill on that last
thing that you were trying to
the best you got experience for
critical hits
back in the day it was and it was
first edition so we didn't care
there were no experience bonuses for
role playing
[Music]
but in first edition d every class
had different experience rates so like
thieves would go up and experience like
much faster they needed far fewer
experience to go up and level
uh than anybody else at one point wasn't
wasn't there different
things to gain experience from per class
yes yeah that was that was a second
edition idea that was not great
okay but you know then
in but most people have moved to the
most people have moved to the like and
you level
everybody levels you know the the oprah
school of gma you get a level you
get a level so monday
after that tangent wow
uh james killing it in the gm chair
we've got two two new players
for quests and chaos who are joining us
there that are uh
it's a good stuff i really like it
tuesday the chaos agents are back
again as always because we can't get rid
of them because the guy who
who's running the game actually runs
this place try as we might we can't
uh that that that like they're going to
be like 80
still running that campaign and
um i i wouldn't object although i think
thomas might object he wants to get us
off the campaign too
yeah so chaos agents tuesday
and then speaking of playing until
uh and with more call of cthulhu
wackiness
and you know we we
are looking you know as
california has put a new restrict new
guidelines in place for when studios can
open and that sort of thing
um i'll be honest we are the definition
of non-essential
uh amy is considered essential
i think she is actually going into work
but question chaos is the definition of
non-essential
uh and we always want to you know
i want to give thomas and amy props
again for
taking every step to consider the health
and safety of everybody in the quests
and chaos family
and making sure that we are uh
following the guidelines and you know
when
we want to get back in studio just as
soon as it's safe to do so
so people wear masks yeah all wear masks
for four months
you know maybe we're back in studio so
let's
we we've got board games i want to play
dammit
yeah we do yeah yeah so
there you go last thing before
we go is just
take a sec to think good thoughts for
the family of chadwick boseman
uh as nerds you know think about the
things that were lost
don't start asking what does this mean
for movies that might be
they can make other black panther movies
what they can't do is make another
chadwick boseman movie
and that's the important part this was
this was a man who
was diagnosed with stage four cancer and
made seven freaking
amazing movies this is a man that
should be celebrated not
you know not a chance for people to be
like well what does this mean for a
movie franchise
consider your priorities in that regard
and
think good thoughts for all of the
family and and friends of chadwick
boseman
uh amy i think we have some bits would
you like to yes we
do who's ready for some math let's
hear it
oh god we have missed this amy do you
like that i love this
okay should we start at the top we'll
just start at the top um
so somebody's favorite twitch user the
baroness
has given 1500 bits of which a thousand
goes to ezra
and 500 go to the players the players
have told me that we have four to start
with
regardless of if they're right or not
i'm taking the four
and adding the baroness is bit for five
so do we have a gi joe moment
oh gosh i i was gonna wear
my my gi joe shirt that has
uh so i've done this one before but i
just wanna once again reiterate
how even though we talked about you know
the new comic books and all this stuff
gi joe is still remarkably regressive
and you can count
the number of minority characters and
women characters
the women here one hand you can
literally count on one hand i have a
shirt
that is just the weapons of all of the
female characters in gi joe i was gonna
wear it but then i put on an alameda
shirt instead
uh but you could easily make that
same shirt
of just the minority characters and i
mean one of them is the freaking fridge
so it hardly counts one of them is a
celebrity tie-in there are
an actual refrigerator or william the
fridge perry william the refrigerator
perry was a member of di joe
and his weapon was a mace that had a
football as its mace head
yeah it's remarkably effective and well
i mean given that nobody in gi joe can
actually shoot anybody
maybe hand-to-hand weapons are the way
to go um
i you know i would need to go the next
time i watch some gi joe i need to see
if storm
like did storm shadow or snake eyes ever
actually kill anyone with those swords
maybe they just marry there's a lot of
ching-ching
on the cartoon show yeah no yeah well i
mean okay fair yeah
but i mean i even wonder in the comics
because in the comics nobody really dies
cobra commander they think he dies every
up every issue
you know that was like uh
that was the the that was the running
theme of that
show sorry amy please
okay i'm just watching thomas click
buttons accidentally and nothing
happened
um okay so what is
happening twitch what are you doing
you're out of like don't make me math
this out
so elder brett yep elder brad gave some
gift subs
um and then elder brat also
gave the players a thousand bits to burn
baby byrne
i don't know what that's all about but
i'll take those
yeah you don't we need more direction
than that at this point
you don't know what burn baby burn means
give us a target
yeah i was like does that mean burn
children away
well that got dark all right blood
no well yeah usually yeah never mind uh
that's gonna get gross in a minute
okay squirrel on the run our favorite
twitch user of 500 to the player who has
a hotmail account
[Laughter]
i haven't changed my email since i was
16. i see no point in it it's on all of
my stuff
have email when i was 16. use that
inspiration wisely
yeah yeah use that it use that
inspiration to spam something
comically indignant about my wife being
nice damn it woman
there we go i was waiting for that okay
brayden five ash gave a thousand to ezra
and a thousand to the players
wonderful and this is a great moment to
once again mention we are
very close so first of all braden has
now i think
completed his his chat game in the
discord
it it being a true quest and chaos game
it was a two-part one shot
yeah but i i think
is it this weekend braden if you're in
the chat put it in the chat
uh i think it's this weekend that he's
doing his 24-hour
massive naira oh what's the day
he was doing it no no i think it's
it's i think it is
next i think it's this weekend but
brayden please put it in the chat
because
i need multiple reminders about things
but
uh he's got he put we put the twitch
page
the twitch page in the chat last time i
want to say it's like
cthulhu marathon or something uh
and it's we had the link last time
but
uh oh two weeks he says two weeks called
the 24 hour
uh see how far they get massive
nylathotep
um i wonder if he kills them all in the
juju house do they just go home early
like if somebody's sleep deprived they
could just be like i open the pit in the
the basement
i mean that that depends on how long
that depends on how long it takes them
to get to the juju house because that's
new york so i guess it depends are they
started in peru
are they starting in new york and also
i'm assuming there have to be sets of
backup characters for this
yeah beforehand here's here's your
backup characters
review them and it's cthulhu for charity
as the twitch channel cool
check that out i'm i'm hoping also
brayden that maybe it'll be on youtube
or something oh he got he says they each
have five backup characters wow
that's they have to be reckless right
they have to be going
you know you have to take some risks
yeah i'm interested to see this
this is this is it like a deck is it
like a deck playing game or a deck
building
like game where you're just like i need
to burn through two of these characters
to get to the good one
i i think that is right that's right and
they are starting in new york
ah okay good okay brayden also gave 500
bits to captain of bing i don't know who
that is who's the captain of bing
personally that's gonna be nick yeah i
was like it's technically thomas but
okay where are we at 500 lonely yeti to
the players
all right thank you lonely yeti thank
you kindly always and then
tamagoto i'm gonna do this backwards 500
to ezra
and then 500 for emma to burn something
i'll take it
good and i think
i think i didn't miss anything so just
to recap
this is ezra's stack this is our stack
nice although he doesn't depart yeah no
it doesn't
i barely use it i i thank you
for your kind donations to the gm but
uh you know i'm a i'm a i'm gonna let
the dice say what the dice are gonna say
kind of guy
not like these whiny players can i
reroll that without inspiration
i'm gonna say it without inspiration two
of you would have died last week
and the best part is tiana would have
killed one of you yeah
sorry nick i thought that would have
been well no because the person
possessing her would have had the knife
skill right
i mean i guess i guess that depends on
whether we were going to be using
alexandria's knife skill
uh if i hadn't mentioned how role yeah
that's a great
question so is it the knife skill of the
person possessing
or is it the knife skill of the
possessive
that actually would have been the knife
skill of the of the thing
um i would bet that it's lower than an
87. oh yeah
um still would have shanked me but i
mean yes but it would have been
less probable and i i cuz i mentioned
that the guy who was doing this was kind
of moving mechanically
but i do want to point out i was
wielding that fold-up chair
with incredible precision so you don't
know how that could have gone
uh did i miss a wrestling episode what
happened
i got hit in the wrist with a folding
chair at one point that was fun
sounds like we need a recap i knocked
out two people with that folding chair
you did it i think you've got a career
in the wwe
uh last week they found themselves at
an auction house
that was trying to bring back
ancient rome using some sort of blood
magic
and almost everybody in the audience
pretty much saved them and a few other
people got
possessed or taken over or something and
they just started lining up in a massive
sacrificial line
and the auctioneer as soon as he touched
this knife uh
would just be start slitting throats
and when whenever anybody touched the
knife
they heard in their in their heads a
voice that said history shall not be
denied
and and it ended up that tiana ended
up on the stage and as soon as the knife
took you over you were like transported
to ancient rome and tiana tiana actually
did
kill one person she sacrificed one
person but
for the most part she like had some
amazing
uh will and also her was wrestled
repeatedly by several of the other
characters
um and they managed to
rest the knife away from everyone and
then
dr hollister came up with some
increasingly complicated
uh plans for containing it that uh
involved uh
filling your bathtub with concrete uh
which you know you might not get your
deposit back on this hotel
the factory damage kind of sealed there
i got a bucket for that
and at the same time joan was in the
back of the uh
auditorium looking for certain staves
that she found as soon as things started
going pear-shaped
and she found a guy in a golden mask who
was trying to steal the staves and
she
chased the guy down and unfortunately
knocked one of the staves out of his
hand and it hit the ground
and this purple mist shot out of it
and started to coalesce and move off
to do who knows what you found out what
but
um and then the site and then
the guy broke the second one out of
spite
uh as he was dying well he wasn't
dying
yet but and the second one also
the same purple mist shot out
and went and and possessed something
and at that point joan heard very
loud footsteps coming
and amy you were not here to
point out how i'm a hack who repeats
uh various things but a terracotta
warrior turned the corner
possessed by whatever that purple mist
was and squished the guy
after jones stole his golden mask
uh squished the guy and then ran off and
jones joan tried to convince people to
chase after the terracotta warrior but
they were not interested they wanted to
get rid of the knife
we were covered in blood there was a lot
going on
all covered in blood several of them
had been stabbed or
beaten up so
currently dr hollister and
joan i think are at the u.s embassy
they're at the u.s embassy seeing the
knife
now wrapped in concrete and chicken wire
uh off to the united states
uh agent rogers is very interested in
the knife
um he's interested in in all those
artifacts
uh and uh
you know we had a little bit of a
little bit of uh
we we we confirmed what a lot of people
thought last
last episode when we found out that uh
uh donal
and alexandra were sharing a hotel room
uh
and we need like the we need like the
bad
70s
and so they were back at the hotel uh
and amy i want to talk about emma's time
in rome
because you've got i think it's like
seven days
here in the eternal city which
unfortunately you spend in the vatican
so it's mainly eternal meetings i had
meetings people
that's pretty much what you did and
so
uh you are brought before uh
your your sort of opus dei kind of
uh
side and you i mean how forthcoming are
you
in your update of what's going on
um as forthcoming as i can
be without mentioning how anybody dies
how any humans one again too you leave
out every part with alexandra and
donnell
kind of but also like the whole point of
it's we didn't i don't think we killed
anybody unless they were a monster
right exactly true not the title of the
show
that would get us demonetized in a
heartbeat
i mean i i guess it depends on your
definition of monster
non-human entity as soon as you were
non-human
you know so as soon as you became an
abomination everything was
who thought the edward
the the guy who fell off his poor dragon
and then you executed
yeah but he was also a devil worshiper
i'm sure the vatican weirdly agrees with
that yeah
100 agrees with it riding a dragon
nonetheless cultists aren't
people what
cultists aren't people you have killed
many cultists
so they don't count as people right
conscious is clean wherever he is on
that front
are you leaving out a large amount of
japanese sailors
tank
i just kept yelling the words flesh tank
let's move on exactly
i've also painted madame lynn as
diabolical
evil monkey woman who also must be
destroyed
well all right that's yeah uh
that is that is you know you can it's
not that hard to paint that picture
not at all are you um
are you forthcoming about what you think
is gonna happen on gray dragon island
and like you know um
your time with the headdress of eyes
oh no no no no no no no
uh
[Music]
no you apparently have to whatever weird
revolution is going on in egypt
well that's a whole other story so i
did explain
that and again just again highlighting
the flesh tank and all the zombies on
great dragon island and how an assault
on grey dragon island
is imperative but yet i am not seeing
any way to do
something as such because of all the
flesh tank
the what are the zombies called the
[Music]
that's a car series i was like these
things and of course i'm explaining it
um i'm gonna make a sand roll for the
vatican
that should be the episode there's a lot
of arm waving
um is uh
and no sword of Akmala is ever mentioned
um yeah the like the artifacts are
there but they just seem to like have
just disappeared i mean disappeared
kind of thing like we don't talk about
the sword of akmala what else is there
um learning rituals for like
elder signs and things i don't know any
of that
there's one of your groups sucking the
again i don't believe that my soul is
fine
[Laughter]
that's all superstition and hearsay um
yeah there's a great deal of drinking
and bicycle
and and explosives
and again when i talk about bicycles and
explosives i don't get verticals or
explosives
uh so yeah this goes on for you know
there is
four days of just like all right tell us
and at the end of four days this poor
uh bishop looks at you and he says
so i need a couple things i need to get
the capstone
on top of the bent pier i should have
actually looked at my notes at the bent
pyramid the red pyramid
the bent pyramid the red pyramid right
the red pyramid
um and in order to seal it i need
the blood of innocence and unfortunately
um our days of human sacrifice uh
are we are far behind us i mean i don't
know if it's metaphorical or not but
that's what like
and you require innocent blood correct
well there there is there is an
archdiocese
in egypt in cairo
um we could ask
if they would if anyone in the
congregation would be willing
um you might have to con
how much blood well
and again i don't have this up but it's
like once per drum beat
um god where's my notes it's like once
per drum beat from
sundown to sun up ironically you guys
have i believe
uh tried to do the math of figuring out
how much you would need and you have not
you have not been able to figure that
number out
do i have do i have a transcription of
that of the actual
ritual itself yes okay so i can share
that and be like somebody smarter than
me needs to mess this up for me
but like in seriousness we wouldn't have
taken like a cup of water
measured it poured it into the the
eye of the thing see how much water it
took and then
timed out the drum approximately and
then rounded up by ten percent
sounds like something you'll be doing
soon but no you have not done that yet
and i mean you actually tried to do the
math
and failed the role uh
a while ago but yeah that would be a
fine that would be an easy way to get
you know to get a close you know a
ballpark number
um and so uh
um you know they are
deeply troubled by your suggestion that
you know
sacrifice and blood are required um
are you really though i mean
i know we've moved on metaphorically
from the blood of christ and whatnot but
at one point
it literally was the blood of christ
well yes and again our our days of human
sacrifice
are far behind us you have to
back to what when these people were
alive
you know just because we've moved on
does not mean that the the ritual
and the pyramid and all those things are
you know have not not the first time i
have said this to you
an eye for an eye leaves us all
half-blind
so you don't want the ritual to work
i want to understand why
you believe a pagan ritual
that calls for the bloods of innocent
is an effective
let me research this can i have access
to the vatican archives
and then i want to spend a little time
going back and actually proving because
i don't want to say oh yeah well julius
caesar told me
why would you not want to say that you
can't imagine
i don't know the drug use the you know
but i do want to go and back up the
ritual
with the fact that somehow find
documentation to allude to that's what
octavian and julius caesar did
or octavian did yeah sure uh
that that is you can um
so go ahead and make me a library use
role
good library this is in the best library
in the world
oh yeah come on baby
i'm so bummed oh 77 that's awesome
we will inspire that okay
god damn it 76. oh man
no no it was one better yeah it was one
better
so you so
you're still gonna find the stuff it's
just gonna take longer so
i'm gonna abstract this out because
the vatican part is not the the
interesting part of this story
um during your time there you're going
to tell them
as much as you want to tell them and we
can you know we can
deal with that as we need to but um
you're going to find the rationale here
and so they they will
um they will put you they will give you
a letter of introduction
to the archbishop of
uh the cairo diocese
uh the only diocese in egypt
um they all you know there is a
there's some
there's some you know between
between the muslims and the in the
protestants it's a hard life for a
catholic and the
and the canoptics it's a hard life for
us there
which which dioce diocese is
it's saint who saint somebody
uh i from my home game i found this out
let's see cairo
cairo
list of catholic diocese it is they're
saint
the apostolate the chariot of egypt and
arabia
second what are we 1926 or something
thank catherine okay so
all right thank you very much so we're
gonna go to st catharines yeah so
they'll give you that and they'll give
you a letter of introduction to the
archbishop um
you who you look at the letter of
introduction it is
fabulously vague it's you know that's
kind of what i was afraid of because
then i'm gonna have to explain what
specifically i need
it's almost literally here's a woman you
signed cardinal so and so but i mean
he'll definitely get you in the door
because it is signed by the his
by the cardinal that that watches over
that archdiocese
um the other part of this abstraction is
during this time
um you will gain a d8
sanity back from uh
from being at peace with your lord and
you know living a normal life for
eight days
some of it is you know you're mostly
sober for
eight days which is is are we really
i mean in the catholic church there's a
lot of drinking of wine later
yes the women religious are famous for
their uh
for their shenanigans um
and so you'll gain a d8 sanity
back and you also get
two skill checks in any skill you want
let me rephrase that non-combat skills
oh okay i was like there's there is not
a shooting range on the vatican
that you know about
[Laughter]
what you use for a second i was like i
have dodgeball how did that happen
i have dodgeball okay so i can't use
drunken sword fighting
that's you know that's how you get
kicked out of the vatican drunken
yeah mixology is also i can't use that
one
you have that on there of course i do so
entire boat ride where i practice my
skills
not a lot of mixed drinks with red wine
which seems to be the uh
the main one it doesn't have to be
anything that i
currently have though right you could
pick two skills
you know here here's your chance to get
your latin better
or
while you can i i don't know did i god
i'm old did i tell this story last week
but did i tell the story of how they
used to decide if the pope was dead last
week
no no no so if
when the pope dies up until shockingly
late like in the 40s
there was a ceremony to determine if the
pope was indeed
dead that ceremony involved the
chamberlain of the vatican
taking a small silver hammer and hitting
the current pope on the forehead and
calling him by his christian name
and if after three times of doing this
the pope did not respond
the pope is dead now hey too drunk
no now it's medicine and all that
but back in the day i ran a uh
at an end game mini con years ago i ran
a fake game
that was all about all the players
were cardinals trying to become pope
and there was it always ended up with
poisoning and killing and
because the the papal conclave like it
this is a satisfying
uh wikipedia deep dive like look up the
papal conclave
it's weird i'm sure
okay so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
hang out
with the dude who's like building the
exorcism branch
vision yeah he's a visionary for vatican
too
um and so i'm gonna up my occult and my
listen skills and i'm just gonna sit
there and be like so what can you tell
me
about expelling demons from human
souls especially otherworldly demons and
then just be like
he is he is only too happy to he
is in the 20s uh
in the basement yeah in the 20s this is
not
you know they're big on
proselytizing right now they're not big
on
uh this area but he he is happy to have
somebody who's interested in his work so
yeah
go ahead and make a skill check in a
cult okay
and if you fail you're going to get a
d10
of course i do a 61 is definitely a fail
to that skill yep and that's five for
that and then i also took
listen just because i didn't do a lot of
talking
oh so emma's creeping around the vatican
like
listening to conversations
i'm surprised you didn't take latin i
mean i've got already
like in latin i've got like a 66 it's
practically fluent
yeah that's an eight oh here's my other
one
and i failed that as well there you go
you get a d10
nice so
okay so after all this and you've gone
and you told them these things and
um my psychology is terrible so
obviously i fail it because i really
don't have much
all right so yeah you you think things
are going great
um and after about five days
of your reports they say
it's clear that you are doing the lord's
work
and we uh
uh we have a we have something you
can help us with
we have a a local businessman who
is a dear friend and supporter of the
vatican
and he has a case
uh that we feel would
benefit from your unique perspective and
abilities
okay um
and um
he he introduces you to uh
a handsome older gentleman he's
he's very well dressed has kind of an
audacious pinky ring
uh and and he
um hello how do you do my name is uh
my name is antonio
okay i'm like big handshake i'm like
something that i care very deeply about
has been
um has been taken from me it is an icon
of a great religious value
and i have figured out and at this
point
uh as he starts to say this the bishop
with you says
i believe i will take my leave before
you discuss your more
uh earthly pursuits and uh
uh sister navarro you will assist this
gentleman in any way you can
okay so i asked him have you gone to the
police with
to tell them that this icon has been or
this
thing has been stolen the police are
completely bought and sold by the mafia
that's who i think took this the mafia
okay and what is the item
oh it is beautiful it is a mask of pure
gold
it is said to be it is said to be
a depiction of the face of christ
have you put this mask on ever i don't
wear masks
good to know good to know
and when was this mask stolen
a few days ago and i i believe
i have found the hotel room of the
people who've done it
okay and you don't have other people you
don't have other associates to um
to get into the hotel i am a penitent
man
and my support of the church
is how i um
a a simple businessman like myself when
i deal with matters like this
of these sorts of things the church they
give me their assistance
got it and who have you who
who did you purchase the mask from how
did you obtain the mask
oh the mask it was brought to me by a
dealer from
from very far away
and you have a proof of receipt
for said purchase of course might i see
that
of course he like he pulls out a bunch
of paper you can make an
role
um i just want to know like is it like
what does it look like does it just look
like somebody on a napkin
obviously i don't make it because i have
no accountant it's definitely a receipt
for payment for objects
got it interesting and you said it was
the mask of christ how did it end up in
egypt
well no so my dealer brought it from
egypt originally he found it in
palestine
and why do you believe who do who do you
think has
who do you think has taken it the mafia
and why would the mafia want to take
this mask from you
is that i'm like is that so how much
like how much money is on the paper
the mafia wishes at every turn to
er to undo the great work of the
catholic church
if they can have if they can take this
icon
and do away with it or or
ransom it back to the church you
by doing this we will be saving the
church much money
okay and how did you come by how did you
come to understand that the mask was at
such a
said hotel what hotel is it
oh god i don't remember the name of the
hotel you're staying in let me see if
you can
and second question am i not allowed in
that hotel anymore
you've never heard of this hotel it's
like you in italy that
you you do recognize it as a down market
it's not you know the ritz or anything
and mr cascaravetti how how do why do
well i have you know
i have bribed people in the mafia to
and i pass that information on to the
church
okay do you have a car of course of
course
okay let's go so you get in the car
and you don't even need to make a spot
hidden his driver
um his driver doesn't speak any english
he speaks italian
but yeah which is fine too
um oh god how bad is my italian my
should have taken italian a little bit
more than latin um
what other things are in the car like
okay so can i
can i spot him or can i see anything
like does the driver have tattoos
because i'm now becoming quite
suspicious of the fact that he's a
god-fearing man with a driver
who's muscle uh
uh so you can sure make me a spot hidden
um it's not great a 73 does actually get
me to a spot hidden which is 86
uh you notice once again i mean
um you haven't been in italy in a while
but
you know this guys like this
are you know if he's he's probably
trying to weasel his way into the mafia
or
he's trying to leverage the church
against the mafia
you know you haven't been part of
situations like this before
where because my my big question
is trying to spare it out who am i gonna
who am i pissing off in order to do this
well i mean you're so the bishop asked
you to help this man
so like yeah you know that's that's sort
of the default
is that you know but the church doesn't
necessarily offer protection like
you know what i mean so if i take
something and all of a sudden it's on me
they would just be like and you're going
to jail good luck for you
so actually you have found that
the church tends to be very protective
especially of operatives like you that
they have put a lot into
even the poor guy in the basement who
deals with exorcisms like
you know when he when he when he
accidentally kills a baby that
you know he was trying to remove a demon
from you know they
um he gets reassigned but he doesn't
you know he doesn't face any any any
problems
any criminal charges um
so mr scaravetti is there anything else
you can tell me
um regarding what the people look like
perhaps
or
i need to figure out i mean it's a large
is it a large hotel
uh it's sort of small it's you know four
stories
but it's got enough rooms that i
wouldn't be able to search every single
room it would help if i knew
either what floor they were staying on
what room they were staying in or what
they look like
um you can make an italian roll oh god
he says i should have taken more italian
nope so you you catch
so you catch the driver's name the
driver's name is marco
okay and that's about what you catch
um and marco says something back to him
and he says oh um
and marco has been he's been
watching this hotel he says the room is
is the fourth floor it's um
uh the fourth floor is the suite
okay
are you are you any good at opening
locked
well i will go with you
great do you have any money yeah i do
fantastic
so i'm going to take so just to kind of
walk us through this
mr scaravetti and i is there is there
like a lobby or something like
a cafe a lobby something like that where
we can go into the hotel without having
to like
directly go into the hotel kind of thing
yeah it's italy there's always a cafe
okay so i'm gonna ask him for some money
and it would be enough money to make it
worthwhile
to have a a cleaning person open a
door for me
okay yeah sure
okay so that's the next task is to just
kind of look around figure out where
um you know behind the bellhop or where
wherever it is to kind of find
somebody who's cleaning rooms no problem
you find that no problem
you slip them you know a shockingly
small amount of money
well actually make me a credit rating
rule let's see how good you are
okay i don't know do i want to change
dice these have been doing so so for me
i don't make it all right so you overpay
this this nice woman
which is fine it's scare of eddie's
money you can do that as long as i don't
underpair she is only too happy to let
you in
and so it's about you know at this
point it's
it's fairly late at night but you and
scaravetti and this woman
are creeping up and you go in
to this room and scar of eddie starts
looking through stuff and you
you know you start looking and it's
at that point that you feel a knife at
your throat
make me gosh what should i say make
me an intelligence check emma
okay i also want to say whatever i i
give up
in whatever italian i do know oh it's a
six
all right i'm not smart you recognize
the knife at your throat that is
damn it you wha seriously put the light
on
as and as soon as i hear his voice i'm
just like what the
what the hell is that emma it's emma
what's she doing with the bug what are
you doing
where are you donald i like this please
explain to me what i see
right now he's on the doorway donald is
in the doorway of the only door that's
open
yeah okay that's fine for a second i
thought both of you i was like
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa so the the way
i've had it explained to us is that
we're lucky
enough everywhere we go to have a suite
where it's like a
centralized living room and then like
four rooms or five rooms off of the main
okay so i'm not sure okay so i'm never
mind i'm not shocked about what i
thought i saw
you have it you have no idea at this
point uh
um and scar of eddie is like
looking around like you know these are
people
yeah well hang on sit down so
scaravetti has asked me to and my
my employer has asked me to find a
golden mask
one made of pure gold that was
apparently stolen
by the mafia so my question is now what
happened
please please explain so when emma said
sit down did the knife leave her throat
oh yeah no as soon as i recognized her
voice then the knife came away and
pure what the hell is this but when you
turn the light on
like if this is scaraveti
he does not look like a bug he's a
last week he said something like what
have you done to me you definitely heard
that
interesting i'm just like
emma our friend here nicked the
capstone
so donald's got his gun trained on on
scaravetti and alexandria has not put
away the dagger admittedly she's wearing
a nightgown so
question is where she where she would
dagger's still very much in hand yeah i
was supposed to say you sleep with it so
it would be just
do we i mean do we recognize him as
scaravetting
you've never seen him not as a bug
how do we know it's him then hmm
what do you mean how do we know it's him
are you asking me are you asking
you're asking the group or asking ezra
in character maybe we don't think it's
scary of anything it doesn't look like
scary
does not look yeah this is a this is a
human
all right can we can we just take one
step back do you have a gold mask
no who's your friend emma why are you
breaking into our room
well because this is mr scarabedi and
again like i had said
my employer had asked me to get help
assist him with returning
finding a gold mask that was stolen from
him and he explained
that the gold mask was taken by the
mafia and that
the trail of evidence had led to said
suite and so
blah blah blah bribed blah blah a little
bit of this yada yada a little bit of
that
here we are in the door i enjoy that you
call the vatican my employer
technically she's not wrong but uh
nick nick asked a good question in our
personal chat this does sound like
scarab vetting
so you heard you clearly heard the
the voice you associate with scaravetti
say
what did you do to me but this guy does
not set like
when you see his lips moving it does not
sound like that
there's something wrong so why are you
breaking into our hotel room you think i
stole something from this thief over
here this mafia
yes so step one i didn't know it was
your hotel room step two
did you steal something from him i
i think it's the other way around emma
right
you where is the golden mask the mask of
the mountain your business bug bug
does he have a wallet that i can like
yeah yeah
okay he pulls out like his little id
card and the voice sounds different
yes the voice does not sound is there
anything that i can see
that looks like him like a manner of
dress
or something that he would have carried
on him that i would recognize from the
time that we saw him
at the the speakeasy or wherever we were
make a spot hidden role
okay his id card says that he's
antonio gervani so
i mean he's not
he's not a bug and he's not i mean he
seems dressed similarly
um there are no the mannerisms is hard
just because how he move how the thing
with the carapace and everything moved
but i mean the dress is of a similar
level
okay crud
did you ever yes steal
a golden mask from the auction house
no what do you know about that mask
fella
and what do you know about that auction
house
i know that my mask was at that auction
house and that i had purchased that mask
and i sent someone to pick it up i have
the receipts you saw the receipts
navarro
he does have a receipt for the said
purchase of a mask
so wait i'm now thoroughly confused mr
scaravetti
so you sent someone to pick it up and
then what happened because you said it
was stolen from you where exactly i was
under the assumption it was stolen from
your home
or from the auction house there were
they said there were a dozen people are
killed
in the in the robbery and that many
items were just look at those two like
really just let us look back at her with
him with a raised eyebrow and trying it
trying to indicate there's a hell of a
lot more here going on than you know
and my you know they they
i i have some connections in the police
department
and they told me that they had traced
interesting right that's really
interesting and wait a minute
did somebody say the capstone was
what happened to that we put it in in a
uh safe at the last at the last hotel
stolen from the hotel safe
got nicked so you never had
the gold mask i never had a golden mask
i'm not discussing the golden mask
fellow you're breaking into our hotel
room here i think you'll be answering
questions from us
hold on i didn't break into the hotel
room i got the key that's not exactly
breaking in
emma that is that is the sort of shading
the truth that gets you into trouble
with your bosses
sort of shading the truth that keeps us
out of trouble with my boss
i'm very confused right now good
where are you so we don't have the mask
and we don't have the capstone so
basically what we're saying is all of us
in this room collectively
have jack [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] correct but you had the
mask
what you know a little more than you're
telling us about this mask and what it
really does
yes it's a mask of our lord and savior
jesus christ
he's he's he's a face i'm gonna pull the
receipt again
does the receipt have a date on it yeah
it was about
four weeks ago
which is you know within which is within
a reasonable time to have it be and it's
for
the the what was it the what was the
name of the ark auction house
i should really write things down you
really should oh gm
people don't think don't do it because
i'm just trying to figure out because
donald keeps saying
house the the marchetti marchetti
okay because like was it ever in his
possession
because if it was never in his
possession then it's not it was never in
his possession he was
okay he had bought it at the auction
from the auction house the dealer
brought it to the auction house
he had bought it there and he was going
to pick it up there he had explained to
you
and that's why the receipt is to the
auction house okay
how about we just settle down make
to come back joan was the one at the
auction house who witnessed
someone wearing this gold mask you speak
of
i think she'll be able to answer or
draw something out of this math so you
don't have the mask
i'm not telling you about new mascaras
none of my business i i promise you emma
i will fill you in
there's been a lot happening the last
couple days also who put the mask on
i mean some some fellow that jones saw
that is exactly what i have to say that
is exactly that are words to live by no
true words have been spoken today
i i third that absolutely
only wants quotes could be alex you got
no we don't have this under control how
did we lose the capstone again
it got stolen from the hotel safe by
someone with those sorts of connections
it's a rash of robberies
[Music]
all right well i go i'll go get um
get dressed basically and then can come
out in a minute too all right
mr scaravetti those same police
officers
these individuals they had traced the
mask back into this room
the baroness figured out what accent i'm
doing
they said this is this is where
the the this is where they had traced
the mask to they said they were going to
send a detective here
really interesting and how many times
have you purchased information from
these police officers
i'm sorry how many times have you
purchased information from these
officers
many times that's how business is done
enroll
but they've been completely reliable
every single time
yeah if they're not reliable you stop
buying information from them
what's your name fella antonio
scottavecti you have my id card can i
have that back please
what's with your family the scarabetti
family what do you know about it
we are a very large family here in italy
it's a fairly common last name uh
myself i run a i run a concrete plant
and i am a a
major donor to the catholic church and
uh
you know the catholic the church takes
care of me they
every once in a while we'll have nice
people like sister navarro here to
help me out
um i'm sorry er i don't know but this is
what we call it here in italy
different terms over there in the states
but do you think i'll i'll i'll
translate what i understand he's
he's saying to be basically like like
not not not a mafia person but some
someone who's supported by the mafia
i mean if you wish to do business in
rome you do business with the mafia at
some points yes
but there's a reason that i give most
of my money to the church
not to the mafia what was the name of of
the restaurant where we met
the mila mila divina
milo divina all right i'll i'll ask him
what what what connection do you have to
oh nine oh they have very nice antipasti
there
they have lovely wine and who owns who
owns that
little heavy on cheese for me who owns
that restaurant
and whose protection doesn't fall under
i don't know whose protection but then i
believe
it's the owner is giovanni
i only know him as giovanni
i don't know so is it a brother is it an
uncle a cousin
who is it that's running all this it's
running a what
another family another scarab ending who
calls the shots
um make the concrete factory i do i am
the owner
well the concrete factory is just a
front that you use right disposing
things
oh i see no
i am not i'm not a criminal uh
i you're just breaking the hotel rooms
in the middle of the night looking for
golden items okay donald you've got to
calm down because first of all
asking if people are mafiosa or not is
the easiest way to get killed
in a home period second of all
accusing people of being in the mafia is
the second easiest way of getting killed
period and then accusing people of being
in the mafia is also the third easiest
way of getting killed here yes
well tonight britain breaking into my
hotel room after i've had a rather long
couple of days is probably the first on
the list of ways to get killed
you keep saying breaking in i acquired
the key
i acquired the key using ample amounts
of money
i wasn't talking about you you you're
just the vehicle this
that seems rude thank you thank you
sister navarro for all of your help and
i'm sorry that your friends are um
uh i mean i i will take it
on faith that the the mask was never
here but
that's very confusing to me ammo does he
have backup
not
hold on hold on how about this everyone
is tired
it's fairly it's fairly late why don't
we have this conversation at a civilized
hour in a civilized place
like the antiques dealership or
wherever that is wherever this place is
or or or a cafe near there so
let them go why do i wish to have
another conversation
with you people with the guns well i
mean
clearly you're you're interested in
talking to us or you would have walked
out by now
you have my id card you have my receipts
for the mask i bought
you give them back to me yeah i think
donna you're your friend
apparently sister navarro she
understands
i wanted help she is helping me you two
who answered with these evasive like
i have never held a mask before i
understand what is happening here now
i'm russian
uh no emma this is i'm not going to talk
about the mask but i have a rifle here
in a hotel room
shares the same name as the fellow who
stole our
capstone they have the same name and
that phone was a mafioso
until you said that i was like why
didn't you go after him but then
yeah that's the fourth easiest way
i think the top easiest way is to go
after someone who's in the mafia so i
think emma got her numbering a bit wrong
so mr scaravetti they're accusing you of
taking
our property
if i took their property why would i
come back here with you
if i took their property i know you're
connected to them
why do i come back here with you why do
i have our receipts
no i agree i personally think because if
we actually had
each other's items we could just fair
trade and i'll move on
one of you is logical nobody has
anything
i sources that i trust told me that my
mask was here
stolen from the the the auction house
and the brought here
well just ask your family where their
capstone is and then
if you can wrangle that up we can
discuss getting this mask back for you
hey my family oh
i i think you'd think that there is
i mean there must be a scar of etti
family that i do not know about
have you you seem to have had dealings
with someone named scarletti
oh yes very interesting dealings
he works in the fellow that we dealt
with deals in a very interesting
currency
everyone goes to the villa davina yeah
and i'm watching his face to see if
mentioning
unusual currency makes him react in any
way
things i am not good at holy sh
all right check that box ought one there
you go
wow he's not react at all he's he so he
is
super confused right now and he is like
he's super confused he's a little
frustrated that he's had a
rifle put on him this whole time and he
uh he is put off by the fact that
you know every time he asks about his
mask he gets like a runaround answer of
we're not going to talk about the mask
we have an inkling of where it might be
it's the middle of the night we got
woken up by people breaking into our ho
excuse me borrowing a key and making
their way into the hotel room
after having a very long couple of days
we are not exactly interested in being
as straightforward as i think you'd like
us to be however we may have an idea of
where your mask is and if we can help
you reunite with it
we will and yet you require from me the
straightforwardness you will not give me
listen through and
we're not in the mood to discuss this
with your fellow what is it like 2 30 in
the morning not that late
it's 10. it's late enough it's late
if you want to have a discussion at
another time um
we should meet and it's only 10 o'clock
come on people
alexandria will hold up her bandaged
wounded right hand and be like
i've had a long couple of days oh where
hell sister navarro i'm very sorry
that
uh you had to deal with these
very rude people and i will be going
and he takes his id card in the receipts
i really want to shoot that guy i really
want to knife him but you know
we can't you both need to be careful who
you're gonna quote unquote shoot a knife
in this town
no i'm very careful i know
right and i'm actually gonna like open
the door again and like lean out to make
sure he's properly gone
there is no one there cool i'm gonna i'm
gonna close the door and lock it and
look and look at them and go
yeah this would be much this would be
much easier if you actually had the mask
and he actually had the capstone
problem we had the mask joan got it from
some guy at the auction house
so where's joan in the mask now don't
tell me she put it on and she's out
about town now
no there are other things out about town
because of things that got broken while
she was around
i don't even know what that means never
they're too long that would be a great
title should we let
john tell her or do you want to try to
wrap it up i don't think john will be
completely honest so
hey don't look at me like
joan tells us she struggled with some
fella who was trying to steal some
staves that she had an eye for
you can understand that and and there
was some sort of struggle and now these
um there's creatures roaming around in
the town destroying things
so we went from struggling with a man
for staves which again i completely
don't agree with why we're stealing
things and then fighting with the guy
who's also trying to steal it
totally not the point here when you
say things
there's a lot of gray area between
fighting for staves and things roaming
about town
lots lots of stuff here we haven't seen
them but
supposedly a statue of some sort
uh animated warrior statue oh and a
mummy that's right there's a mummy too
of course there is so yes we we we went
to
the auction house because one of jones
friends
uh the person he stole who the person
who actually stole the capstone from us
who owed scaravetti a
hell of a lot of money apparently um
we we went to the art house on with with
tickets that that he gave her to see if
there were any interesting
anything we talked about what was this
guy's name
uh the fellow's name was grenetti marco
grenetti
marco grenetti and his dad oh
yes marco grenetti got his head
ripped off by
an anthony scaravetti who looked like a
oversized scarab did he look like this
little man i'm assuming he was a fat
little italian man
sure no but but for but for a second
when
when i first grabbed you and had i had
the knife at your throat sorry about
that i didn't know it was you
um when when i first grabbed him i heard
the same voice say
what have you done to me exactly the
same voice as that scare of eddie so
i'm reasonably convinced that that guy
is him or
he is his human cover of him i don't
know
and when did he say what have you done
to me as i was having my knife at your
throat in that like two seconds before
you said something
no you didn't hear anything emma when
i swear i heard donald did you hear that
that's right knew that was his voice i
recognized it
he was in this room the night before
actually we took a couple shots at him
before
he left okay i'm even more confused
let's just start with
what happened on monday let's just start
with monday let's just start at the top
of the week what happened and alexander
was like sit back for a second look at
the ceiling
what day was monday
[Music]
um do you want to start with the art
house or further back
how about just i had to go to work said
goodbye at the train station
catch you guys in a week or whatever and
then
let's just pick it up from there from
jones friend art smuggler fellow
what's not
to do auction for her right
um and then joan happens to somehow
reveal in the conversation that we've
got this priceless egyptian artifact the
capstone
um okay whatever okay that comes up
unfortunately
so he happens to know what hotel we're
staying at
and now arranges to have the the safe
nicked while we're out
doing i don't know what we're doing okay
so then tourists following that
oh sorry go ahead we were being tourists
and came back all of the notes were and
the satchel were still there but the
capstone was gone
so we went after marco granetti howe
um joan rod yes joan we didn't know at
the time that it was marco grenetti that
had nicked it so
um joan went to lunch with with him
and he dropped it on the table in front
of her apparently and said
help help me and and and you'll get a
cut of the money when i sell this
because i owe
very dangerous people a lot of money
okay
our little friend apparently
right so we she she came back and
told us what happened we were able to
track we were able we were able to meet
up with him
at at the at the restaurant
to try to try and buy it back we got
some money from the
the u.s embassy apparently um
we're gonna just buy it back you know
the simple solution either money for the
item but the
fellow who who runs the mob this bug
fellow
scaravere is not interested in human
currency
again you were at lunch with marco and
all of a sudden we've
jumped to bug fellow well how did that
happen we worked at lunch with marco
yes we did we we we we we we went to
lunch with with him at the place of the
tommy guns remember
that's right the other the sami guns the
fact that i used what weapon was
involved to designate where we were
not parked here not right now yeah no we
we we were at the hotel
of the the restaurant that i
mentioned to him um
and scare not scary about it
grenetti was looking terrified we were
offering to buy it from him
and then a voice from behind a beaded
curtain
said basically it's not enough he and
then scaravetti
beetle scaravedi came out and
wound up ripping granada's head off
so two questions the beetle was it human
before it was a beetle or did it just
have like two legs and some arms just
going
that's not enough money with its little
pinchers i mean we didn't see it when it
was behind the beaded curtain
so it may have shifted but i'm not sure
can't answer that one the shape behind
the curtain was always really large
okay yeah behind behind the curtain it
was huge so
and the only way you know that
scaravetti was the beatle is the fact
that you heard him
speak seconds before you did well it
sounded like him that's all we know it's
the voice sounded very okay the beatles
didn't say hey
no that would have been the dead
giveaway but we have heard that
particular voice when he came
into the hotel room and hollister
sprayed him with an amazing bug
spray concoction oh do you have any left
because tomorrow we could act okay i'm
going sideways on this let's look around
and see if i can find where the fire
extinguisher is
because i'm just saying a little ode to
bug spray we can meet him tomorrow see
if he's actually a bug or not
no there's a lot of things that would
do not yeah do not apply this to your
own skin that is a bad so then the
no the capstone wasn't there what well
i'm i'm actually trying to remember if
the capstone was there and we were just
dissuaded from taking it because tommy
guns
uh you did not see it there okay yeah it
wasn't it wasn't physically there
joan told us that he had it and i i
trust her on that
and so we we were told bring back
five souls and you can have the capstone
and where do we think this mask is well
that's a whole other story the mask you
want to hear about the mask right so
joan did nick
yeah so we we we were at the art house
and
something happened there it went from
being a fairly normal art auction
to a ritual sacrifice it wasn't a
robbery that ended up with a bunch of
people dead it was
a demonic demon that was our demonic
demon
a demonic knife that was possessing
the auctioneer the second he touched it
and he was cutting people's throats as
they were lining up
for a ritual blood sacrifice to bring
ancient rome into present rome
okay and the mask is was there
as well apparently we yeah so
donald and hollister and i were in the
main room dealing with the
dagger situation and joan apparently saw
something in the back room
that triggered triggered her her
instincts so she went back there
um and she told us that she saw a fellow
back there
wearing the gold mask and carrying
staves and
in in the process both of the staves got
broken
um and some purple mist came out of the
staves possessing she said a terracotta
warrior and what we found out later was
a mummy because there's news articles
all over the
she wanted us to go after them i had no
idea how we could do that
so we left and john nicked the mask
yes joan did take the mask off
that's good i mean it's not great but
that's good at least we have some
leverage
then to get the capstone back we don't
have it
anymore okay we have no leverage so we
don't have a mask we don't have a
capstone there's a terracotta warrior
and a mummy
on the loose the gentleman who's with me
is also a bug
and donald keeps wanting to shoot people
in a town where he's like
the little fish in like the ocean like
he's a guppy in an ocean
they came into the hotel room what do
you expect me to do
i mean nothing's burned down yet so well
about that there were some explosions in
the garment district so there have been
indeed we did we didn't do it either
technically
uh the mask the mask is with a detective
uh vesti
who claims to be the greatest detective
in rome
that's what they all say that is what
they all say he he showed up at our
door i suspect he's one of the police
contacts that
your friend scaravetti was talking about
who tracked
uh the mask and everything back here we
gave it to him to go away
because it was that or the dagger that
had made me almost kill innocent people
that was earlier tonight so that was oh
that was
afternoon that was earlier this
afternoon yeah that was around maybe two
or three this afternoon
right so guessing from when
scarabetti met with me is that feasible
that scarabetti wouldn't know that the
detective has the mask and that that
would be
like the the information sort of susses
out that's right and also you remember
scaravetti actually said they said they
were going to send a detective over here
but i mean that detective isn't going to
rat us out otherwise otherwise he'd have
to give up
a absolutely gorgeous mask that i had no
i think you're caught up okay oh also
the dagger was trying to get me to kill
people and was taking it out on my hand
when i wouldn't
got it and the dagger's been dealt with
at least so
that's pretty much done the the dagger
has been put into concrete and has been
and is being delivered to the embassy
hollister was very particular about the
way that it got wrapped in chicken wire
and concrete
[Music]
okay i don't know about the chicken wire
but all right
apparently apparently makes it less
likely to break if
if something bumps the box that it's in
i don't know
that's not that's not my purview i
all right and where's joan hollister
joan john and hollister are dropping off
the the dagger
i could not be near it and i guess
donald felt the pull of it too
okay not that knife i don't i just don't
like it
all right well i'm going to bed in which
room i'm assuming i'm going back to
wherever i was staying
you can use my room it's fine
[Laughter]
i'm going to glance him out of the
corners of my eyes just like it's fine
so what time are we meeting tomorrow
morning i'm gonna go i'm gonna go to my
own house or whatever
whatever the dunnery we're roasting
all right so emma will head out and
we're gonna
cut to the to the u.s embassy where uh
joan you are privy to a very sad scene
as dr hollister hands over once it's
been suit you know once he he feels it's
being suitably uh
contained the knife and also an attache
case of about
what is it now seven thousand dollars i
think is what you have left that you're
getting i don't think we spent any of it
we didn't spend anything i've spent any
of it on
it's the full ten thousand right yeah he
won't give it back
he's a bureaucrat what do you think he's
gonna do we need that money
he like opens the case and he says i
think you'll find it's all there
pushes the case across uh
and the the guy carmichael is just
like
we've we've we've never gotten money
back
well cool then you could just give it to
us we could you can use it
we're doing this so that when we ask for
it next time we'll be sure to get it
oh yeah yeah there has to be trust
that's that's how government works
for delivery purposes you could give us
some of it back no and i'm going to
write out
a full report on why this knife isn't
supposed to be used
that that would be great you've been um
you know you've been basically you've
just told us not to get near the knife
which makes transporting it somewhat
difficult
but as long as as long as we've got it
in a in a locker of some sort that's
locked
yes it is it is sealed yeah i'm very
happy with the inaccessibility of it uh
if anyone hears voices in their head
compelling them
uh and looks like they're going to
unlock it the other person should just
hit them over the head
and put an end to that um
maybe maybe no not so much on the
hitting on the head but sure
yeah we'll i'll i'll note that down and
um
it'll be on a boat tomorrow uh
in in a in a diplomatic hold
so it won't be trump we won't have any
trouble with customs
excellent and it should be uh
you know within three weeks it should be
with agent rogers
uh thank you dr hollister for your
service to the country
it is greatly appreciated and i don't
understand this whole thing with your
boss
but if we can help in any way you
just let me know
will do and so you guys will
get them a good morning yeah that's
right by this time it's quite late
uh you get back to the hotel at like
i'm bummed they didn't thank me for
profusely enough for helping them get
back their items
right i'm pretty sure it was an open
from
um well you were the one asking them to
give you some money so
well i thought that would be a nice way
to thank us
the government is a terrible tipper okay
well there's there wasn't a reward for
this
this is this is what i already get
yeah you are getting paid for it
yeah and and when you when you need
money for things like you know
remember that so uh
yeah so i'm dependent upon you for my
money and my existence yeah thanks
no you can leave at any time and
and go get a job somewhere else if you
really want to
is that what you want i was under the
impression uh
you know saving the world and our
continued existence
was fair compensation
payment oh yeah payment enough so that
why don't you reject your pay then
huh
[Music]
and just do it quickly just saving the
world yeah i just handed ten thousand
dollars back
i did but you still have money don't you
yeah because i'm chief boyd yeah yeah
see see
okay i failed to see the problem with
this
uh you two hear some sort of argument
you know uh
alexander o'donnell you hear like joan
and dr hollister
clearly both very tired but still like
bickering
at like four in the morning as they both
go to their respective rooms
and just like roll over and stick the
pillow over my head just like not
dealing with this
yeah going back to sleep uh
weirdly emma might be the first one at
the hotel the next morning
the vatican is an early rising
establishment
eight days of like living in the vatican
have really changed emma
oh no and so yeah you come back to
the hotel
and everybody is in various states of
you know not wanting to be awake
and that has returned and and and as
soon as
as soon as i'm awake and dressed i'm
going i'm going to fetch several pots of
coffee because i feel like we're going
to need it
and just have it available on like a
little push cart in the room and be like
have fun i heard you two come in how'd
secure oh good the likelihood
of ancient rome coming back
is i feel minimal if we're really lucky
the ship will sink on the way there i
was going to say is there any
is is there any way that we can get
someone to kick the concrete block over
the edge oh and like
the the the trench that really deep
trench that they found oh i don't know
we don't have any money to
bribe people with do we wait we don't
have money to bribe people we're screwed
this time
people just leave rome get a sizeable
amount of money with just
positions
to buy the capstone back right
no that's off the table remember
scaravetti doesn't want money he
refused money
er scaraveti or a scaravetti showed up
at the hotel room last night
it's with emma hey scarabetti what
uh i i distinctly heard the voice of our
friend
uh the bug scarabetti asking what what
the hell did you do to me
before well i recognized that i had m on
the other end of my knife and
then drew back to figure out what the
hell was going on hmm
i have a great idea you know sorry about
that
oh no that's fine i just expect it um
idea around alexandria to be honest i
mean
here's the thing i'm just glad you
didn't like cut my throat before i had
the chance to figure out that it was you
and just been like oh brother
i i i did seriously consider just going
for the kidneys but
you know ugh you wouldn't want those
right now anyway
um i think it's your liver we don't want
right now that too
talked her out of it yeah
i found the sliver of humanity left in
alexandra
yeah cause she was straight up like i'm
murdering this person
they broke into our hotel room in the
middle of the night of course i was
going to straight up knife whoever it
was
and that wasn't first entry sure
but so what
a cleaning person arguments about crime
going on in this conversation
it's been my entire week semantic
arguments it's my entire week of
explaining things that i didn't really
do it's the name of our thing
it's a crime yeah it's just the
uninvited people who have found their
way into our hotel room over the past
24 hours killing them is the correct
response
most of them yes but but but it wasn't
he didn't look like the the bug version
of scaravetti but i heard his voice and
so did donal
so what does he say again we still
we still want to see how he's doing
after the cocktail right
we should set up a meeting oh very much
wait a minute
what did the what did the voice say
again the voice said
what what the hell have you done to me
that's right
what the hell did you do to me oh excuse
me what the hell did you do to me
so something did happen to him then to
make him a bug so
it's or or something happened to him
while he was in bug shape he looked
uh you you said you said last week that
he looked a little bit
malformed in the light yeah there was
like a brief flash in the light where
you saw
yeah formed kind of poisoned bug
yeah i know a guy who might be able to
help
okay who's your guy okay well he's in
the basement of the vatican i don't know
if i can get
everybody in there to go see him but can
you get
sounds like he's someone you need to get
yeah that's possible too
[Music]
and i'm just gonna like take a deep
drink of coffee
right also i don't want so here's
other problems so if scaravetti is
actually a bug
inside somewhere he has connections with
the police officer who now
wait i know this right who has the mask
correct because you guys told me that
you last night right
wait okay so you you filled her in last
night about
yeah she she she came in a few hours
before before you did
and we we filled her in as much as we
could before she
decided to sleep for the night yeah well
so we know we have to go and and
and i don't know get that from the back
well yeah because i am seeing problems
with bug scare of any in a mask
depends on what kind of mask it is i
guess
we wouldn't give bug scaravety a mask
no but he's paid off the cop who
currently has the mask which means he's
just
moments away from getting that mask back
yeah and i mean
maybe i don't know
that mask comes with some firepower as
we've uh
come to understand what do you mean what
remember what the mummy and the
terracotta warrior
did after he got the mask i was about to
say if you just said remember what the
mummy and the terracotta warriors said
to me before they left i would have just
walked away no no no no they robbed a
bank
yeah they're under control now but we
don't
control them do you think that detective
vesti is the one who is controlling them
to go rob
i thought about that for two seconds
yeah
honestly do do we think did anyone
die in the bank robbery
uh i'll i'll i'll go i'll go and
retrieve the newspapers because i would
have saved them to to look through
yeah there were a couple like some of
the guards that got a little too close
yeah a couple of deaths maybe we
should kill him
i mean i'm certainly in favor now i
just you know it doesn't really matter
we need the capstone we need the
capstone
to be able to do sure but we have to set
up a meeting with scaravetti and we
don't know
how long it's going to take for him to
set that up so we're probably going to
have time to check in on our friend and
see uh
he takes no time i have his phone number
when do you want to meet him but the
question
i have a question before that what where
is the capstone
scar he claimed yesterday that he did
not
bug scaravedi took it yeah we know bugs
garavetti has it
yes and i mean emma this isn't the first
time that we have seen animalistic
creatures inside of a human
that's what i'm saying i know a guy we
need to get him out of this basement
but do you know that that's do you know
that that's garavetti
is the same scarab eddie it might be a
relative or
other father whatever because i feel bad
if we murdered him and then found out
that he wasn't okay
that's a line i'd like to not cross so
if you have a guy who might be able to
help us with this we could take him to
that restaurant
why don't we set up we have the ability
to set up a meeting with scaravetti
let's set up a meeting with garavetti
neutral territory so not that restaurant
correct the basement of the vatican
that's not neutral territory
oh a lot safer at least i mean it's
safer but how do you reckon you're going
to get him down there
irish that's where i picked him up i
mean not in the basement but like that's
where i met him yesterday
don't do do we know for sure that they
are the same scare of eddie
no but here's the thing it is too much
coincidence
to be coincidental there is there is no
way
that them that within the day
the same them someone of that name
wanted it wanted to get them the mass
back got someone like emma who was known
for being good at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
to get the mask back as as as was
as within the the 24 hours or so that
we've been dealing with the capstone
we we we have dealt with too many things
for me to believe in coincidence anymore
so just go to this guy's house and
waterboard him what
cool i'm a little shocked by that answer
but
i'm calling hollister you know what i do
for a living
ms has a good point he's connected to
mafia all right if we're gonna
torture this fellow it's gonna come back
and he's gonna come back to us
so the question is do we get the mask
back from vesty
and then deal with scaravetti or do we
just go straight to scaravetti
he goes straight to scaravedi we don't
need the mask to deal with him
not if he's in the state i suspect he's
in
what do you mean i mean i blasted him
with a bunch of poison
and his backside was melting and
and and the and i saw a flash in the
light for just a second
of of a bug that had been well
malformed at the very least i mean in
all fairness that was enough to melt a
person
so that's true so then
do we make an appointment with
scaravetti using emma's connection to
him
i'd rather get the mask first why
because we can trade it for the capstone
why don't we have that
i don't want that mask in either of
their hands that
as far as i know that bug eats souls so
why would we give him something that
i thought you were in the business of
some people's souls and i just kind of
look around the room
beyond help i i make no claim about my
i think as the ring of i thought you
were in the business of saving souls
echoes through the room we are going to
go to break
cool so we will be back just as soon
as six people can use six different
bathrooms
okay
[Music]
welcome back we have returned
and you guys
are it is the morning of
and you are
go back to the next page you are
sitting in your hotel room and you have
made a plan
to i think contacts scar
vetti is that your move but
how are we deciding on doing that a
witch scarvetti
well the mr scaravetti that i met
antonio i was hoping to get um
father don julio to come with me
accompany me and perhaps we should go to
his house perhaps
we should meet at neutral territory like
let's say an abandoned church somewhere
and are you they have those in rome
i don't think they're abandoned in rome
abandoned not really
even your ones
i can't hear either of you what perhaps
one's being restored they're always
doing construction on those old
correct also potentially the
catacombs is another location that we
could meet
um five miles out of town i say we've
just rent out a church for the day
are you suggesting to father don julio
that an exorcism is necessary
correct oh i'm sure he's thrilled are
you yes exactly
it's from mr scaravetti the what's the
other what's the
first part of that telling him it's for
mr scaraveri
yes i am telling him it is for mr
scaravetti um
and that he was speaking in tongues to
me last night
and he said and then alexandria can
like wow
that i didn't hear it but my my my
compatriots also heard that
and then from what i understand doctor
you have some bug spray just as backup
um i just rolled a hundred for father
don julio so there is fire in his eyes
yes so does father don julio also
give me a location and like does he have
the whole layout set up
it will be prepared he gives you an
address okay cool
you bring them there we will purge the
unholy
do we want to set up a follow-up meeting
with scaravetti under the assumption
that we're about to do something to the
wrong scare of eddie
just to cover our bases i don't even
know what that means
i think other people have have something
on the appointment books after
we're supposed to meet him with doctor
with a
father of don julio or whatever just to
make it look like we weren't the ones
who accidentally killed him
oh no i was in case we're going to talk
to the wrongs caraveti
set up a meeting with the mafia
scaravetti
can we have him both come to the same
location
can we get one person or two yeah look
you know what let's send out an invite
see who bites
is turning into the parent trap i don't
even know what's happening here
we don't know for sure that there's only
one
there might be two might be two i am i
am so
i am convinced that there is only one
but i
second invite that's all where though
i only know the gentleman who he gave
you the address and that we we should
have a way to contact
our scaravetti i'm assuming that that
was given to us if he wants those souls
you basically have the restaurant okay
yeah we'll we'll stop by the restaurant
and we'll leave a message
all right and you so
um all right is is everybody going to
i'm going to the restaurant i'm not i'm
i am not letting him go without backup
and i'm bringing up i'm bringing the
masks and the
the bug spray why don't you just call
it and just say like i'm calling my
square media and saying
i haven't for i have your mask so you're
and then why can't we just do the other
at the restaurant and say i have your
souls and then meet at this
said location we've got payments we've
got his payments
his payment yes okay whatever
tour so you're sending a telegram
to antonio scaravetti at his house
saying
we have your payment meet us at this
location
um no because that's the right i thought
that was
the that was the restaurant one for mine
it was
we have your we have information on your
mask okay so you're telling him you
haven't finished
yep you're sending a thing to the
restaurant saying come meet us at
this place we have your payment
do we want to tell him that we have his
payment i mean
from the impression that we're under he
needs to talk to us
we can just say you know we're under the
impression you need our help
if you want to talk to us we're going to
be here otherwise you're on your own no
no no no no
okay wait we're we're getting confused
there's the two scarab eddies right we
have the guy who needs help
and that's that's emma scaravetti and
then we have the guy who has the
capstone
which is the other scare of eddie now
they could be the same but we're going
to treat them like they're different for
right now
right yeah one of them's in blaster with
bug spray
yes so i think both of them need our
help
just just tell the bug we've got his
payment that's what he really wants
and maybe maybe something about the
payment will help restore him
i've heard of stranger things dealing
with power from humans either that or
just tell him to bring our
our merchandise yeah hey how about that
come here and bring the capstone
he can he can assume that there's
payment there if that's the
thing i don't want i i'd rather not if
he turns out to be fine or something
all right all right so are you telling
them to show up at the same time is this
you know yeah why not all right
interesting i'm guessing like this
afternoon
yeah after lunch yeah so yeah you guys
have a lovely lunch
uh and then you go and father don
julio
has sent you it's a it's a warehouse
but inside it looks like a gothic
cathedral
and there are candles everywhere
um when you come in the door he like
flings holy water at you
uh he is he's quite mad
this man wonderful there is especially
since i named him after
my favorite tequila i knew that's where
he's full of the spirits
yes no wonder you get along with him
well no actually you then see why she
gets along with him because in the
middle of this warehouse is a
roaring bonfire
do we all get sprayed down with holy
water when we walk in
yes did any of us say ouch
[Laughter]
i thought about it i thought about it in
my head really loud i
haven't had that since i was a child
[Music]
cool so tell me are these are any of
these the souls that i must
minister to no mr don julio
father they're
it's it's very confusing and potentially
very dangerous
the gentleman supposedly who is
possessed
is antonio scarametti scare betty sorry
the problem is and there are many
problems here
is that the antonio scaravetti that i
have met
my friends have also met but in a
different
form a demonic
form well technically a bug
but i'm i'm assuming satan controls
roaches so really
by a bug demon yes
i must consult and he goes back and
there he's brought like a a satchel of
books and he starts leafing
would he mind if i if i if i took a look
at some of his books i told i'll tell
him that i you know i'm an
archaeologist and i'm very interested in
in the old ways
he has to wrap a book and just is there
something in latin that i can start
looking through to help him
oh dude you do not want to read those
books
they come with a cost oh
those books okay okay so does emma start
reading those books
there's the title of the next episode
yes there we go the masks that i brought
you might want to put on
oh you have some of those masks some of
those masks but i only have two
and one of them's going on me i could
use one of those i
look if if it's going to require up
close you're going to want me in one of
those
that's right okay there's a knock on the
door
mm-hmm so who wants
leo runs over to the door he picks up
a holy water sprinkler by it
flings the door open just throws holy
water and you see
um the the human antonio scaravetti like
go
oh excuse me i was told um
that sister navarro yes yes i'm in
come here tell me
how do you
i feel okay oh the guy with the gun
his weapons have no place here this is
not an
earthly combat this
how does he react to that um
i'm watching that too i i am very
uncomfortable he's very uncomfortable
okay but like oh my god you're going to
kick a demon out of me
um and so father father don julio like
puts his arm around him and starts to
bring him in
uh into this into the room with a
roaring fire and one chair with straps
on it
you can stay up there father they'll
just have a seat
um sister navarro why i i thought you
said
that information about my mask we do
have information about your mask but
this is for your own good
what father don julio here
oh saving my soul is why i give the
church thousands of
lyra and he lives in the basement it's
exactly why
well you have never you have always
been good to me sister navarro i i
understand
uh he sits down and like
uh alarmingly quickly father don julio
straps him into the chair
uh i i'm very uncomfortable
um what i grab him and i'm like pray
with me
pray with me antonio all right he will
he will
yep and we just start doing our fathers
which i don't know in latin yeah yeah
you you do
on it's yeah you're doing hail mary's
uh
and literally
um and
while you're doing that don julio has
uh he takes a tiny
and he is like he's reaching for the
guy's neck
if anyone has any reaction to i'm i'm
i'm i'm watching the door to see if a
bug scarab eddie comes in
yeah i was gonna say i was gonna be
ready with the with the holy water well
i've got the spray in case this one
changes
yeah i'm watching the guy too that's the
other mask
uh alexandria has the other mask all
right so there are the two masks
because it becomes supporters they want
that should be fine against arsenic and
sulfur it's totally fine
it's the twenties no no we kept these
sulphur out there's something else
horribly poisonous in there but i don't
remember what arsenic and
so he proceeds to
uh right behind the ear he
nicks scaraveti
and then he like puts the blood on his
pinky
and he draws a cross on scaravetti's
forehead
creeping hell
good news you've passed the first test
he should be doing all of this in
italian but it's more fun if he doesn't
you know
i i'd have to be translating for
everyone in the room if i did an
italian and so now he
stands in front of now he moves to
italian
and alexandra and emma you can basically
understand
he is now just like screaming in scara
scarvetti is like
now he's scared and don julio is
screaming in his face
about removing demons and then don
julio starts chanting in latin
in front of him and starts and and this
this
can't anybody who speaks latin can make
a latin role yeah
yeah i'm a dice
i could probably make an italian but i
don't i don't i don't care enough
a little more than me i got a one i oh
oh wow so
um he is he this is clearly some sort of
ritual
that doesn't sound fully catholic
okay so it's not prayers and stuff um
no no okay so don julio is like chanting
before him
and then he but the the part that is
catholic is he's talking about
um he's talking about
monophysitism
which is emma would know this is a
um is a a like
6th century a.d uh
religious schism about the nature of
of jesus and
the question was whether jesus was a man
or was simultaneously a man and a god
yeah
and so he is like screaming something
about monophys monophysitism
and like he he he kind of
takes his hand almost in like a straight
knife edge kind of thing and just puts
it
right in the guys where the the blood
cross is
and he like it looks to you
like don julio feels like the hand
should be going through his head
because he's like meeting resistance as
one would expect
interesting
all right so i'm gonna just pray harder
at this point in time and also be very
confused
scaravetti is crying at this point let's
make a sand roll for
scaravedi oh man he's crying but he's
holding it together
oh but he's like
why why are you doing this i'm well i
so if nobody's gonna stop him hey you
should all make sanity rolls as this
all right because it becomes clearer
you're surprisingly okay with this yeah
i'm like i'm
you you actually get a pe you get a
bonus die to this because you wanted to
oh here we go hey you're all
surprisingly fine with this poor man
being tortured
uh it is you're going you're now going
on hour three
okay no one else has showed up
no ah all right we've got to stop this
this is not good
like screaming at this poor man it must
be out of out of his voice by now
yeah no oh no father don julio is in his
element
this is all right
emma what can we do i mean it's there's
nothing's happening
there's no we delivered the telegram
okay so let's so i'm gonna take
father don julio and take him back first
i'm gonna be like
this isn't working he hasn't changed
into the bug yet
oh ye of little faith it's not working
because we haven't taken enough time
most exorcisms and now he like start he
like
he become like he snaps out of like
insane guy and he sort of comes out
like a lecturer most exorcisms take at
oh no i'll crack him i promise
and he goes and he like unrolls like
a a it looks
like it you know basically torture
implements
okay no no no no i'm gonna roll these
back up and just be like
i thought it was to be done with prayer
oh you're one of those catholics
that's why i'm in the basement
because no one else is willing to do
what it takes
to save the world yeah alistair this is
kirk on a fella
oh that's uncomfortable we're all that
fellow
yeah yeah i
is that what we look like to the rest of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with with slightly worse judgment
you can all leave this man
this man will face his demons
and i will drive them from him
i'm gonna look at emma and just like
raise my eyebrows like you want me to
yeah i was like and i'm kind of pointing
as i've like got father donahue this one
and we're like get the gut out of here
yeah little oh no pow wow okay well no
let's
meet up we have not yet confirmed that
this is not scar very though the other
sky already
isn't here maybe this is the same one
nature that that's what i'm bringing out
of him
go all the way back back when there was
a schism in the church
over whether jesus was indeed human or
was divine and human
simultaneously i am removing
the dual nature from this man but it
takes time
i mean that is how these things work
but huh no i know enough
i pay attention to you know what
professor albright has
has showed us and there are there are
some notes
of yours as well and then there's the
ritual for the capstone
that takes time and blood um
the real question is is if his rituals
are authentic and if we have the right
scarab eddie
if my rituals are authentic i'm going to
i just want to know if we have the right
scale ready that's and i don't know yet
why would you bring me someone who did
not need an exorcism
clearly he is with me thus he needs an
exorcism if a supplicant comes before me
it is because they require purging
okay then i run over and untie antonio
what what do you do you gotta go
um so yeah he is
he is like freaking like if you start to
untie him
he will just he's like who the hell are
you people
why would you do this what sort of
monsters and i'm just like
can we just grab him and run out like
the back door or whatever or run
towards the back i don't know don't
touch me let me go
well you won't get your stuff back
that's for sure
don't worry about your stuff fella peace
he like he will flee and as he does uh
don julio says
i can always find a demon
wait a minute who stops an exorcism
but someone that needs to be exercised
and he he holds his arms up and the fire
goes
like bursts up and the door the doors to
the warehouse
all slam shut that traps garavetti
inside with us
or is he gone i'm gonna make a luck roll
for scaravetti
it's scare of eddie was just at the door
as it slams and he's like
no
i think i think his rituals are
and he like holds his arms up again and
the
the bonfire shoots up even higher
okay let us just draw the smoke
cleansing fire of our father
come sister navarro pray with me
let's pray for him i felt like you found
look who's talking i agree with the man
his
methods are reasonable what was the
other thing that you said do we sound
like this
yes you sound like this we sound like
this all the time and you think that's
crazy
okay okay i'm just essentially
i was asking if this is the norm for the
vatican that's
you're you're reading into this way oh
they laugh at me there but you know i
can tell
you've seen things this is true
this is very true that we have been
tainted
should we know your body back in
everyone in with cthulhu mythos needs to
make a power rule when he says you have
been painted
okay yet uh
huh what's everyone reacting to
this long was the orthopedist
okay so hang on a second i'm giving
alexander a re-roll holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 89 is not
bad right
it depends on what your power is my
power is 50 something so can i get a
re-roll as well
yeah i think you're rerolled who else
needs one
i do not i'm good we three are the only
ones with course meet those
ugh i fail it but not my mind
oh no awesome all right so when he says
um you're all tainted joan and
alexandra you shudder
imperceptibly emma you
float up about a foot off the ground and
like you are in crucifix position but
the question that i want to have
answered
the scarabetti shutter or float up
there's a good question
garaveti is still banging on the door we
do we see any
any other reaction from him no reaction
interesting
uh and uh
and when when emma floats up don
julio says
hmm those who seek to be the most
pious are in fact the most
infected alex
and i'm trying to argue with them i
didn't say most pies i mean hold on
is she still floating oh yeah oh my gosh
okay so i'm going to go over to i'm
going to go over to the guy and say
you know it's like i i think it's really
cool that you're able to do these kind
of things and
then that you're able to do this but
how do you know i'm a catholic
you have no place in this discussion
tell me sister navarro confess your sin
[Music]
that's a list seriously
where do i start i mean let's just start
with the top ten commandments
what's number one again hold on let me
look them up remember
it's been a long time since i memorized
that chapter
um so yeah you start to like you start
to almost robotically just list
off sins well i know start off with i'm
just in a general haze of debauchery
and what emerges from that
so i mean so here let hang on let me do
so number one thou shall have no gods
before me i mean technically
he's not a god but he is the black
pharaoh and he claims he's a god which i
know he's not a god but in his head he's
a god
so i mean i don't know is he like god
with little g
him you prostrated yourself before that
false
um i do number three occasionally take
the lord's name in vain i've been try
i've been really good while i've been in
rome
like i haven't said those words but
sometimes it slips out oops i'm sorry
um i do work on sundays sometimes you
just can't help it
things happen i always honor my
brother my father
because otherwise they'd smack the
living [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of me so
there's that i haven't killed anyone
no she tends to go after the the twisted
ones of the darkness
those aren't people i i only kill demons
not humans
i haven't even had sex i don't know how
all right we're moving on i shall not
steal
okay you got me on that one i don't
even know what bear false witness
is lie that's a lie well i do that all
the time
apparently ignorance of the commandments
is not
justified someone has to explain that
one to him
that's awesome really
i mean bear false witness nobody knows
what that means
like around the church everyone just
says it's it's lying
yeah she thought it had to do with a
bear you know
yeah i was like i don't walk or i don't
and then i don't even know like what am
i supposed to covet i don't even get
that
it's something you don't have that you
want
no not really i mean i'm just kind of
along for the ride so if you're stealing
you're probably coveting a little bit
but i don't want it for me i want it for
and then i turn to don julio and say
to save the world he's being quiet as
um as your compatriots are explaining
it's just glowing i mean really we're
questionable
on like one and two definitely hit
number three
and number four and number eight
and number nine you say you have never
murdered
any innocent people or people
they were all non-human demon entities
explain this and he like
makes a motion and in the bonfire
to a very familiar warehouse in england
and emma with a crowbar oh this is
interesting
i think there's a difference between
murder and accident
are you a catholic yes yeah
but wait who did i kill with a crowbar
an entire universe maybe oh yeah oops
sorry
are you the black pharaoh don julio
confess how do you know about that
exactly yes sir this
is an exorcism the minute you stepped in
my
office i knew i knew that
you we're the cause
of evil and i knew
that you needed to be purged
oh don julio i think it's the other way
around how did you know about the
crowbar
hmm 500 bits also to
ezra for for me forgetting about the end
of the world
[Laughter]
really how do you forget it i mean i
know it was like 41 episodes ago but
well
i was hung up on i was hung up on the
whole
okay whatever yeah you're right i guess
technically i did murder the world
oh it's understandable at a certain
point you just get numb to it
it's also too like i don't entirely
believe that that was entirely my fault
okay like legitimately
it was an accident oh my god murder
murder suggests intent it's like
vehicular manslaughter just on a really
big scale
so is is he doing anything is he just
standing there
eddie is like fetal oh yeah yeah yeah
or just like blubbering okay all right i
just want to make sure he wasn't running
around
like crazy or something he is cool
now that you've like when the fire
starts showing him pictures of the end
of the world
and like you know he is like he is gone
like
okay he's blubbering around
and jay matthews 85 also gave ezra a
thousand bits for bringing the end to
the
bringing the inquisition oh nice
i knew as soon as you came into my
office i sensed it i could
smell the corruption on you
i don't believe you don julio i believe
that you are in league with the black
pharaoh
you don't believe me if you doubted my
skills
why did you think i could perform an
exorcism
never argue with an inquisitor
but how did you know wait a minute
oh i get 500 to show how to really use
fire
if i could get out of this position i
would
um i wish there was something i could do
oh there is something we could do you're
my signal
christ has given me our lord has given
me visions
of your evil of the horrible things you
have done
that's not evil am i free yet am i still
spinning around
you are no you're just now floating in
the air
i'm i'm i'm gonna like casually move so
so so that i'm staying behind
don julio and whatever whenever he's
moving he is like he is
fixated on emma okay i'm gonna i'm gonna
yell to dr hollister i think we found
where god you are the dumbest man alive
and i'm gonna look up at emma for for
the go ahead as i draw a dagger from the
small of my back
alex wait doctor that stuff is flammable
isn't it that fluid
no we deliberately kept the sulfur out
oh no arsenic is highly flammable as
well oh this is all
oh yeah this is a powder keg in my hands
get it
i mean yeah i was thinking about doing
that but i was gonna wait
and be a little more discreet i'm
waiting just wait wait until the bug man
shows up
so i just want to be clear you're going
to
you're just going to kill this guy
because you if you
you aren't you're behind him you're an
assassin
sure i'm i'm waiting for the go ahead
from emma because
someone else to absolve you of the guilt
of what you're gonna do
i i have no problem with it with the
guilt of what i'm about to do i've done
this many many times i want to make sure
that i'm making the right decision and
that she backs me on this
i just want to see if emma can get out
of it first and if she can't
i mean this is i mean this one's kind of
tough
yeah i mean so i'm going to grab by
can i free myself enough to grab my
rosary around my neck and just start
praying super hard
just doing like the full our father's
through hail mary's
um make me a power roll
i better make this do it do it do it on
to paradise
you are a good catholic oh ooh
really in a warehouse with a crazy man
in a bonfire
why don't why don't we give you a
re-roll we have plenty
we have we have plenty i i second that
oh do i even use these dice anymore do
but hold on i'm guessing it wasn't good
enough
no it's still a 61. and i need to come
down like
six points you could spend luck or you
could push it
i'm gonna spend i'm gonna spend luck all
right
so you start praying and
uh as you are praying your feet
touch the ground and
uh and and when your feet touch the
ground
uh father
john julio like comes forward he says
yes
yes you must purge the demons from you
so i just continue to pray just flat out
that's all i'm doing
okay forward and he takes you in an
embrace and he whispers in your ear
i need your blood or the ritual
he could exercise your demons for you
afterwards the only the only spirits in
in emma are the ones that she doesn't
want to exercise they go all they all go
to our liver
yep so i'm in a fighting brawl
and put him in put him in one of these
i'm going to grab his arm like as he's
here and just yank it behind him
this is the last thing he's expecting so
you have a bonus die on this
oh i see some doubles i see some zeros
and i see a one
all right so yeah he like leans in and
you just
immediately like take his arm and bend
it around his back
and when you like twist it to where
it hurts
i gotta mark this off i can't mark off
drunken sword fighting where's fighting
brawl again
[Music]
so you you now have um
you have control of him and he is he is
not fighting back
yes that's right prove your nature
there's a chair with straps in it you
need some help
yeah i was about to say let's do that
and then i'm gonna call my boss
and be like we got something for you
think this will make me stop do you
think
i will not hunt you do you think i can
not find you
i know what you are i know what you've
done and now
i know what they've done and
all of a sudden in the fire like
terrible things that you've all done
start popping up as
images in the fire emma i know
that you and he points at joan
are a thief i know that you
and he points at alexandra are a
murderer
he points at donald i know that you
you are also a murderer he looks at
hollister and he says and you
you perhaps worst of all you think that
everything you're doing is in the name
of
science
wait what was i again you are a demon
oh thanks oh that's right that's fire
you
kill entire worlds
you are satan spawn
you have been tainted by
false icons we're just walking away now
at this point
i just grab scare betty i'm like we
gotta go bro
do we strap him in first yeah i'm
assuming you guys put him in
yeah he's raving he says you don't think
i won't hunt you i will destroy you
if you leave here you leave the church
oh buddy you're not you're not even in
the top ten of things that we're that
we're worried about
can we take any of his stuff before we
go like load up on the books
leave it leave it it's evidence first
i don't see how i'm the worst out of all
of it like the scenes behind me are like
reading
books and pouring beakers and stuff and
it's like you
it's like it's the catholic church
they've always been afraid of science
i have someone in hers
so so emma you don't think anything we
can't we don't think we could use any no
let's leave everything here all right
all right
forbidden knowledge it's what you want
you want to get closer to the demons
no i just want to know how to deal with
i want to help people that's all right
okay so i'm
i'm profusely thanking mr scaramucci
for helping us with this thanking him
just completely covering up the fact
that it was like um
thank me you did this to me
you brought me to this madman
why i'm so sorry i thank you so much we
had to catch him he was
crazy do you would you like to use some
sort of persuasion skill to
keep sure i don't know which one can i
do i mean i jump in on this and try and
smooth things over as well
persuade huh
and it's gonna need to be emma yeah oh
jesus there's no way i can assist
um i don't think anyone
like there should be like three penalty
dies on this role already
so that's your assistance is
not even close all right well so he
didn't make his role so
he's just like i just i never want to
see any of you again and
he like as soon as you strap
scaravini and the doors
slammed open and he just like walks out
that was fun and you can still hear don
julio raving
the church the church will know of your
apostasy
so we've i want to find the closest
phone or whatever and then just
basically call and be like he is he is a
satanist he has lost his mind
he is like tied up raving he was making
fire shoot all over the place just like
describing some of the crazy things that
this man was doing
how did he get tied up we overpowered
him
go in there look at his books of satan
ask him to like
show you the future in the flames i mean
he's doing some crazy magical
nonsense sister navarro
in the nicest possible way you just
spent
six days telling us all of the uh
and i will quote you here crazy wild
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
and father don julio
is a bishop and you have tied him up
in a warehouse please give me the
address so that i may come in
and reclaim our fallen brother
okay but you hang up on the vatican
no actually i give him the address and
i'm like all right all right
uh okay but i'm guessing you're not
gonna be around here when they
come all right oh
okay so you guys will slink off into the
into the night go to an italian
restaurant
all right so yeah go to an italian
restaurant and in there
uh there is um
you hear like people discussing
something you can make italian rolls
anybody with italian
and we're going to that particular
restaurant right oh yeah actually
oh yeah five i made it
i'd not be rolling dice you you're going
to the mila divina
that's what i was suggesting yeah i'm
sorry if i was being too discreet
but i want to go to that restaurant
all right so you don't you don't need
to roll italian because
uh things will be very apparent to you
um everybody make me luck roles
and i'm gonna need how many successes
i'm gonna need five successes
i got a five okay is that a critical or
a
what's your i think it would be because
my luck is now
52. that's three that's a fifth so yeah
that's plenty of successes so since
you got the successes
i'm going to offer you a choice do you
want to arrive
after bad things happen or as bad things
happen
i like after i say after
after describe the carnage
oh i hate it i hate it i do ask bad
things
bad things i want to go
there when the bad things are happening
so we can fix it right
you have agency well oh
does i mean i i i'd have to hear a good
argument
just did do any of the other people who
wanted after have any
stay in enough trouble i am in enough
trouble
already that this is one more town i
cannot come back to
yeah i don't even respond you already
can't come back to rome
so you should take that off the table
sorry uh
what are you saying i don't want to be
responsible for whatever happens at the
restaurant i just
yeah i don't want to be us that does it
okay
yeah yeah i think okay i'm gonna stick
with after all right i wanted to be us
that undoes it but okay
all right all right you you have
your opinions of us are way too high
we've
we've survived it all so far we
votes for after so you all i've already
been covered in blood once
in rome same here in fact
um so you pull up um
from a couple blocks away you can
see like smoke and when you pull up to
the restaurant your cab driver is like
is this really it because you see
uh this is the restaurant has been
leveled
huh i wonder what could do this let's
stop
before let's stop before it could be
those um
large friends that we misplaced in
rome are
yes that could that could be it
all right that's yeah we're going to
leave the conversation at that how do we
get in touch with uh
our mutual friend now bestie or
scaravetti so are you going into the
are you checking are you going to check
the wreckage at all or anything i think
we should
see if we find a dead bug in there or a
cap stone
that's what i'm looking for i'm looking
forward to kept the cap stone there
sneak
like it's apparently you know it
hasn't happened too long ago
um there are definitely police on their
way there are whis you hear whistles
um and there are people like trying to
like
help and like clear wreckage yes
we're trying to help include a wreckage
towards the area where we would think
towards like a back room area you know
where yes
yes and sure enough you find
the crushed form of a disfigured bug man
um and he is like like
he is buried in rubble and as you come
close he's just like
oh well
tell us where the captain is first fella
we're kind of your mercy
i'm dying we'll speak quickly
what kind of help do you want
all right donald help me
i'll pull some rocks up too all right um
let's do everyone that's helping make me
strength rolls
uh i failed that oh those are heavy
rocks
that's a that's a bonus die like all
right all right
cool cool i was going to ask yeah
unfortunately
but it's gross
why is it gross i it's a bug
oh it's just bug stuff garavetti so i
need a sanity roll from you emma
okay even with a bonus die
who has the higher strength i'm good
so you pull him out and um
none of you are bug doctors but he seems
pretty well
crushed it looks like
um
why did this statue destroy my
restaurant
ah yeah no it that's what statues do
they go on rampages can't be helped
so the the capstone oh
take me to my house it's there
it's not here it's at your house yeah
all right let's give us those drugs
let's let's go to his house
go to a house man um
so he'll give the or you get back in
your cab and he'll give the cab driver
uh the address your cab driver refuses
to drive a bug anywhere
give him extra money who are you talking
to

little extra money
i'll leave you watching him a lot uh
also he looks like a bug
yeah i make it all right yeah you you
uh you flow this guy some cash and
um he will take you so this he takes you
to
a very nice villa that is uh
several miles outside of rome um
and scaravetti

oh me bastard what
a cocktail of poison
bug man you you kill a lot of people so
i'm not feeling
really sympathetic towards you but look
at this
the people that harmed you we could kill
them for you which i think is a
justification for you helping us yes
yes the capstone in this
it's and he'll like take you and sure
enough sitting on a shelf
all right i i examine it it is it is
just fine it has it doesn't look like
it's even been
why did the statue hate me the police
officer the detective what's his name
yeah he's the one that wheels the statue
he's taking out your mafioso types
holy crap i didn't make it who won
i'm the most powerful i got double here
all right do we need some of these or
no
possibly i would take one i'll take
one too
okay how about three why not
oh that is that is very different uh
yes that is a critical success as well
all right so
only donald all right sorry
you feel yeah you feel like sort of a
a just kind of a malaise comes over
you
does everybody just do something no he
did not
you can see he didn't like say anything
i'll i'll see donna like sink a little
bit and reach over and put a hand on his
shoulder are you
are you all right i feel dizzy a little
tired there
one of those some of those
mind things i don't know what what
try to remember tired it was a little
bit like when joan
used the staves i don't know if that
ever happened to donald
it happened to alexandria if he
describes it like that i'm going to be
like
sorry what like a little bit of just i
don't know like
energy trying to avoid the gi joe
conversation going on in the chat
so something there's some power here
power from you
there's something or someone i i guess
or some bug scare that he
said that he could smell magic
um eddie said that as well yeah
yeah yeah so he must have more magic
things in here
i'm gonna i'm gonna start scaling around
here
you just start rooting through
scaravetti's house well after
after that gets described in his room
there
where we are so how long are you gonna
spend rooting through his house
hmm well i'm looking for something
that's like the staves or or a a stone
um i'm gonna spend most of time in this
room and then kind of go out from there
uh i would say i would say it'd take a
half an hour myself i was gonna
say everybody make another power rule
all right if it's a half hour everybody
make me another power roll
well i was in the meantime yeah
uh no i i was going to say to look for
10 minutes
and then if something doesn't if i
don't find something by then
i was going to spray scaravetti down
with the rest of the poison
all right so i'm i'm not in the room
are we 30 minutes or 10 minutes because
i also want to do that i'm doing that
all right so i'm not going to wait all
right so you just walk up to scaravedi
with the with the fire extinguisher
after after 10 minutes of looking and
asking him
what happened i'm out of the room by
that point because he told us that he he
oh that's true nobody's asked him
anything he's like
i have he's lying on a bed like dying
yeah no i'm asking if he's doing that i
i'm suspecting huh
doing what did you did you drained
donald
who's donald oh there's something else
in this house then there's something
else going on
i don't want to die
that's a good question is he looking any
better no
well i'm gonna spray him down all the
same all right
so but i'm out of this misery doctor uh
so yeah you can easily just shoot him
full of
chemicals i'm not in that room i'm i'm
and he dies damn all right let's search
this place
okay now yeah all right so who is in the
room when he does that
i was there all right
so as he dies his
carapace cracks open
and countless
i'm on a chair but he's covered in
poison as those beetles are also
covered in poison right it's true all
right so everyone but emma loses
one emma you lose three sanity
okay and yes
the each of the bugs as they come out
there's like a weird little like green
like poison field coming off of them as
they come out
and they just start to die
yeah let's look out of here i i
definitely make a very undignified noise
when i see that happen
do i hear them at all i'm because i'm
i'm oh you can hear alexandra like
i'm sure there's a there's a an
undignified noise out about
there's a lot of screaming okay now we
can jump to the half hour mark
i mean her her throat is still kind of
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up but she has opera training
you'll hear that sound
okay ooh
i wonder if they found something are you
gonna go up to the room are you
no i'm still looking i'm still looking
because now i have more to go faster
oh we're gonna just shorthand this he
was sucking powell out of people
uh he didn't know it at this point
because he was so out of it but
and you don't find anything else you
find
um you find some guns
all right i tell them about that you
find some
you know you find some dogs of the tummy
variety
you find so everybody who was at the
restaurant make me an intelligence role
before or this last time before who
is
critical too all right so at the
restaurant
statues statues cancel out guys
efficiently that math checks out i i
i wonder if it was something personal
with vesti
and this fellow and and if that's when
if he turned the uh
the power of the mask and the terra
cotta warriors specifically against him
he's cleaning out the mafia oh no
yeah probably consolidate power we've
several times so then the question
becomes do we deal with vesti
the night is young though it is
we do have we do have we do have back in
our possession
the thing we needed and we are not
letting that thing out of our side again
and we haven't had dinner let's raid his
fridge
okay but what i'm saying is that how are
we going to keep a
huh how are we going to use how are we
going to kill a mummy and a terra cotta
warrior
i mean does vesti know that we have a
capstone and it's worth having
like i think it's better to just get out
of town
well we can just put bullets in bestie
as far as i mean as far as he knows
we're good friends
and if he wants to dial things back we
might just show up and be like hey
be more discreet because there's things
out there that'll come for you
don't know that's a good idea i think
leave on that note peaceably
you could just write a letter just send
a letter
i i think
what's gonna happen if i could do my own
pretend f don julio fire for a second
and show you the future
shit's gonna go wrong we're gonna end up
killing a cop
or being accused of killing a cop in
rome
after the vatican is already completely
annoyed with me for the don julio stunt
this is all going to end badly don't
ever think it's going to end well
our sage advice is crap advice get on
the boat
well well you're leaving out that we're
in pretty good standing with the
american embassy here
yes so if we need to get out
we have a good way out we haven't
completely botched this
and we we might be in good standing
with bessie
well that one if we do kill a police
officer in rome that's really just the
cherry on top
and i mean keep in mind emma you have
two people who
have experience getting in and making
i'm getting on the boat i'm not even
just let the roman authorities deal with
this fellow let's go back to egypt
he's part of the roman authorities oh
they could deal with their own
no they can't i don't want the police
the police
well then all i can do we kill the cop
of new york and you can never go back
there
i do you want you want me just to go
talk to
okay well we've got we've got the
capstone back so we don't need the mask
to get the capstone we don't need to do
any trades we don't need to do any of
that stuff
he's only doing going only going after
bad people with things like robbed
he runs that's true it just killed a
couple
uh yeah he killed a couple guards
he just thought bankers were bad people
so you know i mean
either way i don't mind dropping by just
to let him know hey
you didn't realize the value of this
when we gave it to you
so stop and realize that there are
things that you don't know out there
and you're gonna get their attention do
we want to tell him that
uh scarab man's dead
no you know cuz you know what's gonna
happen we've just created another madame
lynn scenario
the less he knows the better he knows
let let him come for him
all right
yeah there's nothing here to take i mean
nothing here to discover anyway
in that case i'll let rogers know in a
telegram
there you go that he has the mask and to
fire bomb his house
all right get delta green pointed in
that direction i'm fine with that
all right unless they don't want to melt
the mask which controls a terracotta
soldier but then they can deal with it
they can deal with it we don't have to
yeah so you yeah you will
if you once you spend the next day
you can
find passage you can get on a boat
that will take you to cairo
uh it is so that is may 22nd
there are incredibly hilarious duchess
hijinks on the boat that we will all
laugh about and remember for years
um i'm sure uh
and you find yourself
in cairo let's see i need to check the
shipping time
it's just three days or something like
that i don't know for sure but i
well it's from london to cairo
was about i'm basically going to do half
the time from london to cairo
well london was around the outside
whereas italy is
right across the inside yeah so it would
be you know what i mean so what it's
like
four hours or something to like africa
from
spain let's see yes
it's not that far
not peru not pre-generated pcs
all right let's check the egypt chapter
this is just good radio
don't suppose we we could we could make
an argument for making those guilts that
according to the internet it says six to
eight days at four to five knots i think
we need to buy a fast remote
well they have that ceiling that's
sailing though yeah that's really not
like sailboat
yeah yeah but it's still not going to go
that fast
i mean unless we want to be or not stand
back
true true but yeah take some time to
do some uh
therapy there you go it's also a
possibility
that's awesome yes therapy and maybe you
know
but we are actually our skills we do are
so it will you know why don't you just
look
in the index that's right why don't you
instead of flipping through pages
yes
that would be that'd be cool
i've been above 30 in a long time
i don't know how i feel about therapy
he no he he was he was daft he's one of
us
the catholic the catholic church has
always had a problem with science
so of course someone who tries to solve
things with science is going to be seen
as the literal devil
exactly but here's the thing he is one
of us
and we said that he was crazy so where
does that put us
and i don't need therapy from an equally
look if it helps me put and put down
roots a little bit deeper so that i can
hang on long enough to see this through
i will do whatever it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] takes i'm
just saying
was it was it religion or science that
it was a terracotta warrior it was none
of them
it was a magic terracotta warrior see
he was significantly weakened by the uh
the poison spray
true i enjoy the poison that's for sure
he also had no i like he had no idea
what it did to him he was
like he'd never experienced that so
um we're gonna
say it's a week that means you're
pulling into cairo on may 29th
so yes i'll do skill checks well
no is that seven psychoanalysis
checks so we're gonna we're going to
we're basically going to
uh give everybody some sanity back and
yes
so do your skill checks and then we'll
deal with that all right
i don't get that latin i don't get the
italian check do i because we just went
to the restaurant
did i also get fighting brawl for the uh
for the for the wrestling hold i put on
what's his name
oh that's the best this is the worst
for the the the player characters are
the real monsters of uh
um here's a sad thing i've
literally made every single skill check
that's awesome
i've made all of mine oh i've been i've
been i've been rolling like
0.502 really oh i've been
i've been rolling i've been following my
trash i'm in all my trash
no everything's like a few we're talking
like really like oh i have a 15 in this
nope made it oh yeah i know me too it's
like oh i have a two in this
what things you guys remember about how
you left cairo
[Laughter]
before
yes the one time i wanted a fumble and a
knife attack and i got it
didn't we leave cairo i don't know
night of chris then we came no who came
back didn't the b
team come back to finish the job each
team which included donald so donald was
there for night of chris
yeah cairo was fine when i left it
ezra i i have a skill that's at 97 now
you gain a d10 sanity i'll let you roll
it thank you
thank god it's a 10. there you go god
[Music]
oh so how did we leave cairo
i can barely remember other than
probably terribly
so the first time you left cairo you
left pretty quickly
and the girdle of knight of chris was
there and the b
team then found the
thing going on and the black pharaoh
actually didn't want nida chris to come
back
and so they did some they made a deal
with the black pharaoh
i remember that but that wasn't what i
remembered how did that go donal
yeah how'd that go the black pharaoh has
the heart of knight of chris
yeah the new girdle
[Music]
and yeah
and that is about where they left
remember all the followers are being
devoured by these creatures of the field
or whatnot
and i think there was being set by the
there was indeed another evil emma
we needed to get a list to keep track of
all of the evil emmas
which one yeah exactly
nice but evil emma's dead now
now didn't get that one i have murder
cat
i have statues of copper snakes i don't
what was the murder
what murder cat which town was murder
[Music]
you never saw the murder cat yeah that
um oh wait is evil emma dead i can't
remember no knight of chris is dead
so yeah you come
into port saeed which is where again the
ship
uh pulls you off emma beats up
another hotel guy
and i don't think i have to anymore
reputation sees you and he's like oh god
no
your reputation precedes you how much
sanity do we get back on the boat
oh yes thank you thank you make a
anyone want to inspire that yes yes
i'm sorry what i was like huh
okay there we go yes that would be i
rolled a
five that's not a
no that is a critical success critical
success all right then everyone gets
eight
sanity back wow you could
oh my god i just took the biggest jump
insanity in a very long time
i am super sane you get one sanity back
that's all that's all i need yeah right
is out of curiosity during it during
the week on the boat was there was there
a music of any variety that i would have
gone and participated in
sure yeah me yeah i don't i don't need
anything for it it's just
it it's just it's just a fun flavor
thing for me
so you stop at port syed and you head
into cairo
the last time we were in cairo was in
april early april
oh yeah critically made it or extremely
critically whatever that is
that's a critical for me as well so yeah
everybody who got a hard success or
better
you notice at port syed there are
a lot more soldiers
and they are um
they are egyptian soldiers not english
soldiers
so did we get a cab driver yeah sure
yeah you get a cab driver
okay who's the first time i was here
show you all of beautiful cairo hold on
last time i was here there was a
military
base that went to we should return to
that base perhaps
to the army base you're going to go to
be a good idea
well the army base is on the outskirts
of cairo on like the far
side of the city so you're going to
drive through the whole city you're just
going straight to the army base
i think we should okay
are are we able to get a view of the
city and how
things look at least on the surface as
we pass through it
we're about to drive through it sure
yeah um
i mean if i mean if you have contacts at
the at the army base that might not be a
bad place to start although
emma didn't you say you had someone at
the uh
the catholic church here oh yeah we have
to go see that person
i heard that laugh ezra for
our mission but i mean we need a
place to stay first we can't just
rogers have put us up at that base
that's where yes that sounds like a plan
probably one of the best places for us
to be okay
um so you will pull up the cab driver
like pulls up at the base there's a
soldier at the front
uh and he comes forward and he says uh
and
well look at hollister yeah we're all
looking at hollister
oh yes yeah i i show him my
identification
oh of course sir come on in uh
um do you have a military rank or are
you
i'm i probably have like a civilian rank
you're a gia okay
yeah so yeah they'll bring you in um
they the cab driver wants to get
out of there as quickly as possible
yeah fair enough oh on the drive
drive-in you notice that there is
definitely
more of a military presence
uh and everybody make me a luck role
successes three successes all right
um so yeah you drive through town and
and the main thing you notice is that
you know there were not like armored
vehicles in the streets the last time
um and yeah you didn't make the
you got three successes there you go uh
you get to the military base
and hollister you've been on
military bases before this place is on
alert
uh there are you know there are more
centuries than usual
uh there are everyone is everyone uh
is armed they have just they have
dispensed weapons
um and you
um you yeah you notice that this
place is definitely on alert
uh almost like it's almost like someone
and you know the um
the the the the co of the of the base
will will you know will will bring you
guys into a conference room
and he'll he'll he'll say um
i remember you you were here before
so why are you
i'm very all right look do you know what
the situation is right now
i have an idea but you should brief
us we've been out of country for
several months so
pretty much all of
all of egypt except the coast has been
lost
the to the armies of the black
pharaoh the english
have essentially been removed there's a
provisional egyptian government that's
did i stutter what does that mean i'm
not familiar that uh
well we've been assured by their
leadership
that they will that they will observe
the treaties
that egypt has with the united states of
america
but that doesn't mean that we're not on
alert
yeah that's what's wise and this this
provisional pissant government they
they can't keep cairo he had an
intel on this group i've never heard of
anything about them before
all right are you trying to lie to this
guy
uh the army the black pharaoh yeah i'm
curious what this guy knows about him
intelligence guys i mean but so you're
you're gonna like because i mean you
have you've
you've not heard of the army of the
black pharaoh but you've definitely
heard of the black pharaoh and
right all right made a deal with him
and whatnot
well there's that well luckily he's
distracted uh
we don't have a lot of intelligent about
we don't know where they came from they
just they
i mean somebody apparently organized
the goddamn bedouins or something and
they've all risen up and
pretty much if you're not in cairo
that's gonna be a problem for us our
target destination is within their
territory
go armed i just said
um we'll have our ceo talk to your co
and
make arrangements for what we need to do
you have a ceo right rogers
we're gonna have to be responsible for
ourselves to a certain extent
this this is a very delicate diplomatic
situation right now
yeah states of america is going to
maintain these treaties
we can't be seen as aiding either side
i mean look i'm i'm happy to put you up
here
but i'm just glad that most of you
we appreciate the help once we've
american now joan you're american right
yeah yeah
all yeah well once we're established
we'll conduct our rco and
get further instructions what we need to
do but thank you for your hospitality
appreciate it yes very much so of course
uh if i could share if i had you know
i'm happy to share whatever intelligence
we have
uh any any areas that you recommend we
stay out of
more than others um
how do we get permission to go to a how
do we get permission in order to do a
dig
someplace you don't have to do a dig
there i mean they this these paperwork
this is whatever this army is they
oh ah this is it's some sort of
nativist uprising they're they
definitely congregate
around they definitely congregate
around pyramids
oh no all right we're gonna needle we're
gonna
have to requisition a good bit of
ammunition and an airplane
and some explosives sorry we already
have
some of that yeah let's let's have this
conversation with our co
uh yes eventually perhaps yes
thank you they have a um
yes let's let's wait until we have a
conversation with rogers and figure out
what we're doing
well to a certain extent we know what
we're doing
but let's let's let's have a convo come
on guys let's go i mean whatever you're
gonna do
i wouldn't take too long i'm not sure
how long cairo is gonna
um he'll give you the room he's gonna
sweep all right
what the hell happened the last time you
were here
last time we were here the night of
chris was raising her own army with the
intention of taking over the entire
nation of egypt
um and then that proceeding that we that
she had
the gathering she had was entirely
destroyed disrupted all of her followers
were killed
that's the last we knew of it whatever
she called her group
they were slaughtered apparently
replaced by a new group
that we were unaware of black pharaoh
himself is raised
oh no they know that you made a deal
with the black pharaoh i can't remember
if i think i think he told them
yeah he he he told us that that was that
he needed the headdress of eyes for a
deal he had made
yeah which no longer exists
true i wonder how
far how well that will go over with uh
the person who made a deal with
well we didn't see the black fair
briefly in a blimp
and he seemed to be sort of all you know
forgive and forget he was very black
pharaoh
oh i don't think he's going to be keen
on what we're about to do
he will not what we're about to do is
going to be incredibly difficult because
we need to
gather a group of people and transport
them to the
red pyramid where most certainly at and
we have to clear out
all evil around that pyramid
before we do the ritual while the people
that we're escorting don't die
what all night for this ritual yeah
it's a long road long process they have
to be secure
it's a moon rise to sunrise aren't it
and what day is it and what day is the
full moon it is currently the 29th
and i think the eclipse is the sixth
the sixth 6th yep i can't believe i
remembered that
yep so we have eight days
yeah i wanted to be here sooner than
that but
well the business in room took place
yeah
do we have everything else we need
except for the
people
we need to leave now and try to gather
the people from whatever
places we we have no time well we we
have a a a
a a diocese but probably we don't have
that anymore do we
we have do you have your note we've got
many ways to figure this out but um
we're not going anywhere in this hustle
circumstance i don't know how we get in
there with all these people
yeah well
if there's an alternative come up with
it now
we need to think about this i do like
the airplane idea
we won't be able to get enough people
onto an airplane not unless we're
willing to drain every single one of
them of all of their blood and i'd
rather not no we can't do that we have
to
the blood has to be spilled there well
that well i
i mean we'd only be able to bring enough
people to once there
drained them entirely yeah on an
airplane
from the book that you took down nile it
was about a day
into the into
uh the the pyramids from whatever
that
well let's let's i'll i'll do the cup
with the water
if we haven't done that already on the
eye to figure out
it's starting to start doing math you
spend some time
you you crunch the numbers it is
something that i
you you have the answer okay i'm not
going to pretend like i know what the
math of it actually is
and ironically the book does not mention
it
does that give us at least an idea of
how many people we would need to
get good good amounts because i
mean we need to figure out what kind of
a convoy we're dealing with
around see if it
says anything about that because i mean
if if there if there's any way that that
we can there there was someone at the
blue pyramid club who was egyptian but
thoroughly
anglicized if we can get him to
make connections for us and have it be
egyptian appearing on like a riverboat
with all of the white people stuffed in
the bottom
yeah and and then and then arrive
and what sounds that sounds like a good
use of today right
i think so is there anyone else that we
need to contact in cairo why
i think we've burned we've either burned
most of the bridges or we've used all of
the favors
within because the closest that that we
have to a friend here is a priestess of
bast and
that's what you say cat lady i have
something the black pharaoh used these
underground tunnels when he brought us
back from the ocean
and traveled all the way to the
gathering where night of chris was i
i don't recall exactly where the
entrance was he's one he's a crazy
fellow but these tunnels
exist that might be the entertainment of
the century darling
he's a crazy fellow
but i'm worried we're if we're if it's
the army of the black pharaoh
we're going to essentially the pyramid
of the black pharaoh
which i imagine they're not going to let
us do a ritual
at their worship's pyramid we're going
to have to purge the area of evil
that was that was always going to be i
mean that's why we have a
flamethrower here in a requisition form
and what
one flamethrower is not not enough well
no but we're also going to get copious
amounts of ammunition
and we're going to see that yusuf wasn't
here because i
you know let's try the long game i mean
we've got a couple like
infiltrate the brotherhood race through
the ranks
move all the soldiers you know if i if
it's a nativist organization we are
way too late for that and joseph is
kind of brain dead at the moment i think
do we have any allies at all in egypt
i really don't think we have anyone here
that we haven't completely burnt out
besides i can i ca i'm sorry andre i
can't remember the guy's name at the
blue pyramid club
oh that was yeah
i have it in my notes somewhere spy was
who's that is there a reason emma's not
bringing up the introduction
i mean i can go i just don't i need
somebody who's
obviously not gonna sound crazy like i
need the blood
of so many innocent people in order to
shed to close the ritual to put away the
brotherhood of the pharaoh well i don't
think there's a non-crazy way to ask for
that
nigel wassief him ah yes okay
was he the the newspaper person
i mean very soon we're not going to be
welcome in cairo anymore either
regardless of what we do
so may as well go and ask and say it's
to stop the cult that's from taking over
the nation
uh we might get some help from the the
locals
do you think the locals would be willing
to help with something like that
if we can stop the army of the black
fair i'm sure they would i mean that
depends on whether or not they
think that's a bad thing i mean the army
of the black pharaoh
kicked out the british yeah imagine if
that happened in ireland donal
um they haven't surren like the army of
the black pair has not
like you don't know if cairo
if they haven't wanted cairo yet or if
cairo hasn't
surrendered or what but it they have not
taken cairo yet so there's
some resistance to that but but but the
rest of of egypt has been taken over
it's the tribesmen which means they're
probably you know not people they're
very
happy about taking over their cities um
that they had a they had a local group i
can't recall there was egyptian natives
who were looking to take
power themselves and actually had
ministerial jobs and a
government all set up and whatnot would
want to keep power
i mean if you if you can remember any of
them maybe we can
maybe we can talk to them sadly it
was not me to do the uh
all the diplomatic stuff we had the
doctor and then we had
the other emma oh that was when you were
here with doyle so that's right
right
[Music]
i think the other had made a couple of
friends she was a
newspaper reporter or something like
that was very very socialized
meeting people having parties and
whatnot
um
but i don't know if she made any
contacts we could have utilized at this
point
maybe maybe rogers can ask her and see
if there's someone we should we should
be speaking to
maybe huh i really can't well i will
look for next time for the exact
sort of number of people to give you a
cent but you
you know he did the math you know how
many people you need you will have
that number awesome i mean we just have
to convince as many people as we can
um what day of the week is it emma may
29th
um it's a friday so we have until next
saturday
i think on that sad note of exasperated
size
we're gonna call this episode
uh thank you so much for your
likes your subscribes
the the crazy amount of bits
i have used bits before i'm not i'm not
i'm not a perfect man i'm not gonna lie
uh we have just this is
among the most quotes i've ever written
down
uh so we started with well julius caesar
told me
there are other things out on the town
right now it was a demonic demon
okay we have no leverage like he's a
guppy in an ocean
we're really lucky the ship will sink on
the way there
i spend the we i spent the week
explaining things i didn't do
i know a guy he's in the basement of the
vatican yeah
yeah here's other problems uh
that mask comes with some firepower
it's too much coincidence to be
coincidental i like that
but it was and kind of
i thought you were in the business of
saving souls
i named him after my favorite tequila
i don't put on masks i don't read books
how do you forget about the end of the
world i think might be the episode title
that's good and then the follow-up i
guess technically i did murder the world
um
i'm in a warehouse with a bonfire and a
this is my my second choice for episode
title this is one more town you can't
come back to
and our sage advice is crap advice that
was that was
true but i think i think it's gonna
be how do you forget about the end
of the world
really i like it's uncoincidentally
coincident
it's
i never get to give episode titles
uh so next time we will start up with
your efforts to
maybe win back egypt who knows
well we're not gonna get that ambitious
