let's not let's not get ahead of
ourselves this is a cautionary tale
they'll be live streaming it here on
twitch
starting at i think 10 ish uh
give or take amy and yeah we'll see
it's it's kind of a european 10.
i was going to say alaskan 10 but sure
that works too
there's a joke in there somewhere but uh
so um
so that's sunday monday dragon of ice
fire peak is back
and again i just can't say enough of how
much i'm enjoying dragon of ice spire
peak
just mainly because james uh
is so much fun as a gm the players are
terrible
but james really lifts that game hey
everyone but me is really good
well but
james is fantastic and
so that's monday tuesday the chaos
agents
you know union negotiations
are a whole thing and the chaos agents
are having a one-week sit-out
they are you know they're trying to
renegotiate their contracts
you know beau is upset that there were
only there were more other colors than
green in his m
m's and so this tuesday the chaos
agents
they'll be protesting by voting yeah
they'll be protesting by voting we're
going to take election night off
because either we're going to be
really happy or the world will be ending
one of the two you know go either way is
that tonight
[Laughter]
possibly
okay i'm just saying there might be a
box it's true no
don't keep that crowbar away from her uh
and so you know we
tuesday the chaos agents take the night
off um
so that they can doom scroll that's
really what tuesday's gonna be honestly
i fully intend to sequester myself with
like
avatar the last airbender and just binge
watch that
and ignore the rest of the world i've
had like spoiler alert
we did an interview with james cameron
um
last week and it yeah i know chaos
no not no at work at work it was like
chaos did an interview with james
cameron that's
and warren and aaron now he's in new
zealand shooting two three and four
and in four they have to wait to release
it because they have to let the
characters
age so two three and four happen
sequentially but
then the end of four happens like years
in advance
just a little something i'd throw out
there when we were talking to james
although i will say avatar the last
airbender and avatar blue people are
only tangentially related mostly through
the name
i i thought i followed that train of
thought off the cliff
boy those names from movies are a little
on the nose we call the sequel two
uh this time even three year uh
uh so so yeah that'll that'll be that
and then
saturday saturday poor thomas and amy
uh they so wait amy you're doing
back-to-backs man here no i'm not doing
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
on saturday except this show oh all
right you're not in the saturday game
all right so
we have a saturday afternoon we have a
new
um we're not even calling it a one shot
we're gonna
you know we'll have it's probably gonna
be like eight episodes who knows
but my buddy james in the gm's chair
for rhyme of the frost me
uh it's actually is it i think it's one
through ten levels or something isn't it
for a while yeah it's a long module wow
and i i'm gonna watch this
just because james is one of the players
and tossy is one of the players and you
know tossy from
our from our gloomhaven games
uh he is one of my fav just
tossy is one of those people who makes
you smile whenever he's around
and james is i think a very similar
person and so that just that pairing
and then other members it's it's a
question chaos game so i'm assuming
tiana's involved
you are incorrect i get to take saturday
afternoons off
wow first time ever i know
i feel like there should be a drinking
game if tiana's not on the show drink
you know that's like you know you'd only
get one drink a week that doesn't sound
like a very fun drinking game
but questing chaos is doing it yes it is
a question chaos game but tiana's not on
it
i know you know what people people get
sick of my face after a while and i get
sick of being in front of this really
bright light for hours and hours so
you know i i i wanted i i'm perfectly
happy to not be in something
uh i said though i'm gonna be playing
pandemic for multiple hours so
that's right i can run but i can't hide
but so that will be saturday i believe
from two to five
yep and then thomas has just enough time
to suck down some food
and then we're back here at six and
thomas will
pretend like he's listening as he as he
does the board
uh and we will be back six to nine
thirty as always on
uh next saturday i think that's a that's
a rundown of our week but so we have two
new shows
starting this week very exciting i
think it's gonna be
it's gonna be awesome i'd like to pause
now to let let's have the scooby-doo
reveal as we find out
old man jenkins was actually the the
jawa there
uh joan wants to breathe so what
she's asking way too much to want to
breathe over there i was
i was really hoping like slightly talk
would pull them out that would have been
so
funny you know the reveal would have
been you know like
um so uh
yeah there you go again we'll be
doing a
birds of paradise dice giveaway we'll be
giving away one of the i think they're
the arizona sunset
dice there's a lot of arizona dice in my
house right now
all right you'll be getting in arizona
some set of arizona dice
and now formal wear i know i was like
went from being dead to man about town
yes there we go classy so
last week you made it to kenya
and you you've
you know you've already done your
darndest to get kicked out of kenya but
it's
against everyone's against all hope
you're still
somehow in the country and semi
unknown that you are the the evil doers
um so you uh
you you took a very very bad train
ride
and a an evil
sorceress was on there and let you know
that you had been
expected someone had been waiting for
you
and you does the spambot count as a
follower can we like you know i don't
think so
especially so
um you had she knew you were
coming
and she summoned some sort of horrible
fire spirit that started a major fire
in the train
uh the train pulled over alexandra
killed the sorceress in full view of
the third class
car on the plus side alexander's in a
different body so maybe there's a way
you can get out of that
um and then a a
a a poor porter was a collateral damage
uh as donald killed him and
several partners that the the the
previous porter what had
said his throat slashed opened by by
night of christ
control at that point yeah you you also
uh cut open the throat of a you know
blood magic
it's the blood's got to come from
somewhere
uh and the uh
so yeah the the train ride was lovely
the scenery was fabulous
um the the trip itself was
fairly dangerous and so you are uh
one of you i believe uh
dr hollister is already in
uh is already in nairobi he took the
early train
uh because he was a witness and he has
given
very bad descriptions of uh
all involved and
uh that is that is
very helpful and then the rest of you
are are waiting
uh you have snuck alexa chris as we
are calling her
into you have snuck her
into as i understand emma's first class
compartment
yeah and you are uh
waiting to to sneak her out uh
uh when you get into nairobi and i think
i'm gonna pause and uh
it's time for my favorite segment week
to week of
watching amy do math so hit us with some
numbers amy
math is not hard this time around
because we start with four bits
yes then our favorite twitch user
squirrel on the run
500 of the players thank you
tomorrow you know what you know what her
costume is a traitor
he's one of those spacemen on uh
uh
among us in the back yeah that's right
yeah
so okay tamagoto 500 of the players
something's gonna get lit on fire
i can feel it oh yeah and then 500 to
ezra from tamagoto as well so
see all right we like you anyway the
mango tour is just like the wisdom of
solomon he gives to both sides
and then just waits for the destruction
yep he's like every corporation
give give both sides and come out the
other end uh
great well thank you so much for the
bits i also saw that we had
uh somebody
we got a sub but no somebody uh
did a like gave a hundred bits and i
we appreciate that as well
um lucifer vilshack is uh
highlighting messages for no apparent
reason lucy for watching i am amazed
yeah what it's like three in the morning
there man
uh i i think lucifer had to see what
your costume was
oh that's right yeah after making the
comment that certain people would find
it very hilarious
i i think i i i have not seen you know
if you're gonna do father guido sarducci
you need the hat
that's like kirk doesn't have a hand
he doesn't need a hat
i'm playing a a cardinal in his game
a cardinal wow are you a vampire
cardinal
absolutely wow there you go the vatican
is the
this is why this is why emma doesn't
trust the vatican anymore
and figuratively they mean blood of
christ
and we did uh
all right so yeah the the second uh
the the engine will return it'll pick
you guys up
about seven in the morning on june 18th
and then it's about another hour into
nairobi
uh so how are you um
emma you have scoped out in the first
class cabin
that the porter sits on one of those
little fold down chairs
at the end at the door in so there's one
porter there and then there's the
bartender
who is apparently armed at the
very end of the car
like almost at the caboose okay
um so alexandria you've got two options
okay let's hear them i can shove you
back out the window
ow or we could cut your hair
put you in some men's clothes and a hat
and then we could leave together and we
could you could be my boyfriend
and it would be scandalous and everybody
would be so shocked nobody would even
know that
they'd be so overwhelmed by what was
happening to even know that you're like
you were actually a wanted killer so i
mean to be perfectly
fair because i mean i would have well no
i i'm wearing more of the loose flowy
arabic things aren't i um
but i would have gone for the more
masculine look than the feminine look
that could work theoretically or
uh you can cause enough of a of a
distraction to draw people to the
do not cut the i i don't i don't want an
evil queen screaming at me in the back
of my head
yeah cutting cutting her cutting her
hair is not something that
there would be some roles involved i
imagine
she's she's a rather protective of
her hair probably the best solution
is you get the attention
of the the porter and the bartender
those are the two
workers in this car pull them up pull
them
to one side and make it so that i can
sneak out the back and when we slow down
step off the train and
hide so if you if you want to sneak out
the back
like that is down by the bar part of the
of the car there is a caboose
on this train that is after
uh the bar
i'm thinking though that there should be
like a a platform between between the
two of them
and i'm either going to use the platform
and climb up onto the roof of the train
and then
come down the side when the train
slows down enough so i can get off
without killing myself or hide in the
caboose
and sneak out when no one's looking i
wonder if this will read
i don't know if this map of nairobi will
read but the train station is
actually in town
well but the train will have to slow
down before it gets into town won't it
yeah so nairobi is not a small this is
not a
podunk town okay is is the
the the gist of this uh
uh it's it's about it's almost 10
000 people okay i have a better idea
emma let's just put all of the hair
clip it up pin it up get it out of the
way i'm not cutting the hair i don't
want to have that fight
okay so let me do i do i do i travel
with a hat
with like or you know what i'm gonna
actually go into
the second class cabin and borrow
something from
donald or whatever hollister left behind
so they will not let
they're not letting you go between uh
cabins they have locked this thing down
so the only part of this train that is
still there is
the engine has connected to the second
class cabin
uh and then the second class cabin
then your first class cabin and then the
caboose are the only parts of this train
uh and they're like if you the porter
will very politely but firmly
like say sorry we're asking everyone to
stay in their cabins
in their on their cars
so at this point i'm like i'm sorry sir
but i need some things from the second
class cabin
uh well then you can get them in
nairobi ma'am
but why can't i have them now i mean
this is ridiculous
i haven't had a drink and i don't know
how many hours your crazy bartender's
got a gun right back there
there's no way you know what i need a
drink somebody needs to give me some
drinks
now the bar is open down there you
can
you can uh
uh i i mean as do i ma'am
oh so here's a great idea i think you
should go
i'm very sorry ma'am but i i'm i'm suppo
i'm watching that i'm
i've been told not to move you'll just
return to your
uh unfortunately some of our amenities
have been curtailed due to police
activity i don't know if you've heard
but there's been a couple murders
uh on board this train two
is a travesty two porters
and and a woman
were killed by uh
i'm sorry to hear that sir i think
i'm gonna go get a drink to ease my
nerves
so i go back to the bartender does he
have
any does he have a hat does he have
anything that i could like swipe from
him
sure yeah you you you fought yeah
oh god you find a a a newsie make a luck
roll
okay [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
do i have one of those within reach hmm
yeah i was i asked him for a super
complicated cocktail
and every time he's like what's in that
oh god what's my luck my luck is like
oh six yes
there you go all right yeah this this
this hat
fits perfectly sweet so i basically
shove it like under my stomach and kind
of lean on the bar
yeah like thank you and then like do the
he doesn't even notice that's perfect
all right i'm like here you go grab it
and then just like begin the process of
clipping all of this hair
up and pinning it down and then putting
the hat on top of it
yep and then take off some of your like
dressy stuff
and then put on like a coat like like um
uh what's the london fog like all
weather coat kind of thing a trench coat
type of thing
yeah sure i'm sure yeah you can you can
you have some
um you have some surprisingly masculine
clothing that uh
uh you had to borrow a bunch of my
clothing back
in cairo so i imagine it's just micro
there you go yeah they don't fit
quite as well anymore
well that's okay i can live with that
um so yeah you will um
uh all right let's see here
yeah the uh
you pull into the station and uh
the porters are dealing with uh
the porters are dealing with all of the
work of sort of getting in
and all that sort of thing and so um
you are able to step off
without without noticing without it
seems like
uh it seems like everything's fine um
dr hollister is there with all the bags
uh and dr hollister
make me a make me a spot hidden role
i think you're on mute nick
oh yeah i definitely i didn't fumble
all right i didn't fumble okay
yeah so you know there are some
there's some people waiting
for the train there is a a young
woman a young
uh english woman is there and
she is asking a lot of questions of the
station staff
uh and seems to be taking a lot of notes
she seems very reporterly
uh and yeah so the train comes in
and to the shock of all uh
alexa chris is able to like
surreptitiously
semi come off the train with emma
and you all meet back up and you're
standing on the platform
of the nairobi train station
and did i have time to get us lodging
sure
yeah you you have let's see here you
got lodging at the lovely did you
want to go with like a safar
so there are two kinds of hotels in
nairobi there are
okay hotels and then there's like the uh
safari bungalow hotel
uh which one would
alexandria be able to stay where what's
one where
we would all be able to stay together
well so um
um there there would probably be
something in the
uh in the indian district in the indian
quarter
um it's not a great hotel but
um you find you get rooms at the norfolk
the norfolk right
all right for once i'm gonna write down
anymore because of things we do yeah
then we'll need
two backup hotels to split up with
that's fine
did you secure those or do we have to
also get that in for get that settled
so this is actually because nairobi is a
big
um safari town there are a number of you
know you can rent
tents and trucks and that sort of thing
actually fairly easily
although most of them are run through
services
where like you hire they have the guides
they do all the stuff
that sort of thing yeah but let's
actually that's a good idea
um yeah when i get a chance i'm gonna
look for
a something that we could
that we could crash in if we needed to
van or whatever right i'll know it when
i see it
uh so most of the safaris travel in a in
several trucks and then they have um
they have guys who set up the whole camp
every night yeah i'm looking for more
uh i'm gonna when i get a chance to to
look into that
i'll just tell them like oh i'm with an
experienced crew
we just need the equipment
uh any oh sure
yeah you you can do that when but not
not
not at this point so you come in you
get off the train
uh
not that good a journalist and
uh you can you can all
let's see who so at this point yeah
uh everyone except dr hollister can make
i'm holding the sign up high come on
make this roll
uh 30 30 hard success all right so
you all except joan uh
notice that there is
an african gentleman who is like
no he is clearly noticing your uh
arrival and he seems to be uh
looking at alexa chris uh
with a with a note of recognition
okay i'll i'll just glance over
and like look like i'm doing a sweep of
of the area and don't let my eyes linger
on him for
any extra amount of time but definitely
note him without letting him necessarily
know that i've noted him
well yeah you made a very good role so
that's no problem
we should get out of here yes so a
hollister takes you to your hote to the
hotel
uh it is in uh
uh not a great part of town uh
there are much like shanghai there
are various quarters there's the europe
there's
the european quarter the african quarter
the asian quarter in the indian quarter
and your hotel is in the indian quarter
um
you're sort of on the outskirts of town
um you have a couple names of people
that you were looking for here
um you also there is the nairobi
star is the local rep paper
and and there is also the colonial
government
if that's you know something and i mean
they're the people who found
the bodies of the carlisle expedition so
you know you have you have several
areas
directions you can go what would you
i mean i announced what i want to do
right terribly
allister wants to go off and look for
safari gear
well more yeah more looking for the
vehicle for win
i'm not saying that you're going to draw
undue attention to us and we're going to
lose this
our stay in this fine establishment why
am i
just going to plan around it as though
that's what you're going to do
oh it's it's probably going to happen
we've gotten we've had trouble with
every hotel we've stayed at in the last
what is it now six months here's the
fellows looking at you alex
several of them are not on fire though
you already have someone interested in
you someone that someone was watching me
very closely and i don't know who that
is
well did they follow us
i imagine you were watching for him i
didn't see him i would have been
i would have been watching especially
knowing that someone pinged me did i
notice anyone following us
you don't feel nope okay not as far as i
can tell
they may just they may know that there
are not many hotels where a
mixed color group can stay so it's not
they won't be that hard to find us i'm
sure
that you're talking about giving us a
truck and living in the back of it is
that what you're thinking
then then the truck yeah so we're not
gonna stay here for very long right
we've got to go make a a
yeah i mean we're gonna have to be
traveling anyways so we're gonna want
something that can off-road
that's fine but where are we going is
there another pyramid we have to find
here
it's a mountain here isn't it correct
yeah the mountain of the black wind
yes what do we know about we've known
nothing about this mountain how do we
find out more information
does this room have a mirror
what yes yeah your room has a mirror
okay yeah there is one more thing i need
to do
but no to donald's point we do need to
find out more about
about this i doubt if they have any
libraries right here or any place like
that but i was thinking about the paper
they must have a library in nairobi of
course
find out where the expedition where the
people were murdered
i suspect that could be the location of
the mountain as well or someplace close
it'd be nice about the history of this
mountain at least some someone has got
to look into
what the history of what we're what
we're going into yeah yeah no
that's the murders are fake though they
didn't actually happen so that that's a
cover-up which we shouldn't be wasting
our time looking into
we also need to know which mountain we
also need to know which mountain it was
because if i remember correctly we were
looking for the mountain
and didn't find one that was called
the mountain of the black wind
and also as you as you came up
there are a number of large mountains
in the distance not the least of
which
is mount kenya
there's mount tima which is fairly close
uh there is i mean uh
mount what's the big one there that
uh
now kenya is the very big one but
kilimanjaro is not
that terribly far away it's also not
that small
no none of these are that small so we
will need to be prepared with mountain
climbing gear
i mean i don't know it would have to
be somewhere that could be accessible
to do rituals and sacrifices and things
so it can't be
that high you have to hold a body well
it could be high it just needs to be
accessible without a excessive climbing
skill
some more importance to the people
cultural importance
not just any mountain something that
meant something to him
not necessarily it could be something
long forgotten that only a select few
are aware of
well there could be a history that we
can look into hopefully
so it sounds like maybe visiting the
newspaper and uh
and seeing where that takes you is your
kind of that's what i was thinking first
just to see because yeah wherever the
expedition was found
let's just look about that first and
then but then kind of go from there
right
we do have some time before the next
eclipse or the next full moon rather
i hope so actually technically
okay the full moon because i was like
there's a new moon in like three days we
need the full moon for the ritual
where are we going to find that many
innocent people
is on july 6th is the next full moon
that's right when you you you
the office of the nairobi star is
literally a shack
and the shack is mostly printing press
uh there are when you come in
uh there is um
there is a the the woman from the
train station
is there setting the type and she has
two
young african assistants who are helping
her out
um and she will introduce herself
as amelia smythe
forbes
and let's see who anybody who wants
so dr hollister in your you know just
in the
few brief moments as she's introducing
herself like
this is clearly um
this is a bad case of white savior
syndrome this woman
um well it's so love hello hello
i'm amelia smith forbes i'm the the
editor
and the main reporter for the nairobi
star
tell me what what brings such a
wonderfully liberated group
alexandria is completely dead pan
i was gonna say well you know we we uh
came for an expedition um
and we've been following the path of
several other expeditions that have come
here before
uh they're very popular
yes yes but there was um
there was one that that didn't end very
well
oh good you can you can tell us what
sorts of things to avoid during our
time here
well i'd say hippopotami are really
the most dangerous animal out there
they're surprisingly fast and very very
territorial
i think we need a hunting rifle of some
sort then you would deal with those
well if you you know if you work with
any of the camps
here they can set you up with all the
equipment you'll need
uh it's it's a it's a a wonderful
industry
that helps this burgeoning region
now were you were you working here at
the forbes when the carlisle expedition
oh yes yes i was i i spent some time
with the with those poor unfortunate
souls
yes and and we have read about those and
and i was wondering if you could give
us any more information about what
happened to them because
we don't want to be in that same
position
where did they go that was so that we
should not go
and what position do you not wish to be
in
we heard they were all killed right yeah
is that true they were wiped out and so
yes as long as you hire a safari
service you should have no problem
was that the trouble that they had and
that they didn't hire a suffice
safari service no let's see here and
she goes
she goes and like starts looking through
files and she'll um
that has basic stories about um
you know they they came in they stayed
at a place called
um hampton house which is one of the
nicer hotels
there's she's oh and look here's a
photo
and she pulls out a photo of the carl
expedition just before they deposited
nairobi
and two things
two things jump out at you right away
one is that carlisle and brass brady are
and that um
hypatia masters
looks doesn't look great in this photo
and hollister you can make a medical
role
that's bubonic plague
oh i did not make that medical role but
again everything's fine
i did not fumble well that's that's
great yeah
from the precipice she does not look
well in the photo
that's you're gonna remember hypatia
masters is that
asian masters was kind of carlisle's
girlfriend
but she was also she was the
photographer of the exhibit
of the expedition i should say sorry he
wasn't she was an african lady
no that was benay or
um and then they also she'll
she'll pull out an article about the
then the the slaughter
and it it points out that a lieutenant
mark selkirk
of the queen's african rifles found
uh sorry the king's african rifles uh
found the bodies with his squad
and a later report describes the capture
of five
nandi who were tried and found guilty
for the murders
and there is a photo of the hanging
we don't want to we don't want to run
into anybody like that
where were they that that uh
well you know it's oh everybody
hey emma you recall that jackson
elias spoke to this woman she was
mentioned in his notes
okay so she knows your good friend
jackson elias
oh good friend jackson elias
yeah i was like what was her name again
uh ms smythe forbes
okay oh smythe forbes you must know my
friend from new york
my good friend mr jackson elias well
i do remember that name yes he was a he
was a lovely young gentleman
he is fantastic we were good friends
he he was quite a writer
uh a little a little rude a little
brusque
really i found him to be more eccentric
than brusque um
maybe it was his eccentricities that uh
well you know season to taste and all
mm-hmm he
uh i believe she spoke to
uh she spoke to the minister roger
corridan
he did and he also spoke to
captain montgomery with the african
rifles
uh yes he is the captain montgomery
and she's english so i should have said
lieutenant i was about to say in the
chat
but okay and
what what other what i mean did he come
here to chat i mean what did you what
did you discuss with him
no no he wished to know
in greater detail about the travels and
about the
uh status of the of the carlisle
expedition he was very interested in my
uh my observations of them given that i
did an interview with them uh
and yes did you interview um
roger at the time that this photo was
taken and i point to the one where he's
actually missing
uh i know mr carlisle apparently was not
feeling well
the day that picture was taken okay
uh yeah did you interview him out at
the campsite
uh no i interviewed them at the hampton
house ah
okay so had they gone to the hampton the
campsite yet or
no they had not left yet but okay um
and they were you know they were they
were very peculiar i'll give you that uh
um and oh miss masters poor dear she was
sick some of the time indisposed in the
mornings you know
um carlyle i didn't see
uh sir aubry mm-hmm
uh he seemed he seemed to to enjoy
a drink
and he was he was full of life sir
robbery
surprising for a man that age
is is any of the other people here
paying attention to this conversation
no the two guys are she she had given
them instructions about
setting the type and they are working
diligently at that okay
okay and either of those guys are the
guy you saw at the
oh no i'm just we're inquiring about
something that is gonna bring
unwanted attention potentially so sure
so what did what did what did mr j mr
jackson elias find so interesting about
your observations
uh well that's where the brusque pod
comes in he didn't find much interesting
about my observations he he
pushed rather uh
we'll call it what was the word you
used eccentrically
uh aggressively wanting to know
about their mental state and that sort
of thing and
i i don't feel that it was that i had
any
anything to really add to that
i have no judgments and as i said ms
masters was not feeling well that day
but
otherwise they seemed fine if
if peculiar
peculiar well they were going on a
safari
but they weren't going to hire a safari
crew and
yes
is there anything else that that gave
you the impression that they were being
no it was principally the the not no
safari uh
company that's if you don't have a
trained hunter with you that's really
not a good idea
so the location of the of the
unfortunate incident
where exactly did it take place
well you know no
no no it was in nandi land
which is should i get this right
uh nandi land is to the north of here
somewhat you know some somewhere between
and the gentlemen that were hanged for
the crime were they
local from they were tribesmen they were
nandy tribesmen the nandi are the uh
tell me what do you know of what's going
on in egypt i've only heard very little
there's a there's a revolution against
the crown
indeed oh my
did we travel through it it's not about
me
yeah yeah i mean we traveled through it
so as of right now yes
well but we will see how things turn
out
yes i'll have to i'll have to learn more
about that well um
if i can be of any other assistance
please do let me know it's so
so wonderful to have some uh
some civilized voices in this this
backwater
where are you staying you really i hope
you should you should join me for
oh most of you should join me for
high tea at the grosvenor
most i i'll just look at him and be like
perhaps if we can fit into our schedule
no no she hears your voice what
um huh it is
it is significantly safer to travel as a
man i find
i see i see well very interesting
very interesting
uh again if i can be of any further
assistance please do let me know
um and when we look i'm gonna just as we
leave can
i want to look around is there anything
that would strike me as suspicious any
occult type items anything that would be
no this place is pretty sparse it is um
the
essentially the front of the shack is
her is the office with her desk where
she like has
a little typewriter and all this stuff
and then most of the rest of it is the
oh look at that thank you elle elda
brat
gives me 500 bits because
nick didn't dress up wait a minute wait
a minute
nick did dress up he's a homicidal
maniac they look like everyone else
well yeah i wore pants for you people
no you did not you wore shorts i wore
you know almost
pants you wore short pants
yes sir i have a question is it possible
to see her desk where she's working on
her news stories
yeah well she is not paying like as she
starts talking especially when
you know she pulls out articles and
stuff you can case her desk totally
i want to see what she's working on
right now especially our little train
adventure
okay yeah there is a story about uh
uh the train adventure that about
about the murders on the train and the
fire
um and about the uh
the was it was it part of the tribal
insurrection
and she seems to be blaming
the well she's sort of
she's asking the very leading question
if the
uh kikuyu central association was
somehow involved
okay do you know
how do you spell that kikuyu is spelled
k-i-k-u-y-u
yeah the mental note of that i'm not
going to steal her notes or disturb her
desk in any way
just repeat it return it and she seems
utterly oblivious
uh as she's you know talking with you
guys
okay 500 from the muffin mage because
of pants
panther time you know you need
somebody to join with the name the
cupcake mage just to like have the
just to have the cup have have
have the the the confectionary made wars
right that's right
it's it's the you know that'll be my
next
mitten the great eberron baking contest
yes i love it yes please
love it hey ezra remember the last
time you made a joke like that
yeah i'm retired all right so
uh what's next
apparently well we're gonna have to
after we leave the
establishment correct right all right
well we did get some information about
uh
this guy named mark selkirk and his boss
that the colonel
um can we get some
yeah is there any way for us to get any
uh permission to talk to them
i mean they there's a there's a there's
a camp the military camp
in town you could probably go and ask um
you also got the name roger corydon who
was at the ministry
and that's that's in town he's you know
probably some version of some under
secretary of something
oh boy more politics we're so
good at those well we might as well go
talk to this but i'll see if they know
anything useful who knows
no harm in doing so right
[Music]
depends on how entrenched in local
uh race politics they are yeah i mean i
i may very well be a liability
alex how about we go do a little
shopping well i've i've got some
i've got things i need to take care of
uh alexandria can come with me while you
guys handle that
um why don't we make the military man go
talk to
him that's what i'm thinking dude can we
get is there any way we can get you know
help from
the american side to talk to these
people or anything like that there is
nothing done american military base here
no no there's somebody who's part of the
american military
not not on the not on the not on the
books i'm not
yeah not in the way that the they would
understand
listen doctor i don't think the british
military wants to talk to me
all right it's not something we don't
get along there i'm going to want to
talk to me
more than they'll want to talk to an
irish more likeable than i am
what do what do i roll for get
alexandria away from the group so i can
talk to her
about knight if who's taking control of
her what do i roll for that
i like psychology right no i no i i'll
we we need to have people with with each
group who are
experienced with weaponry so donald it
would be better if you go with the two
of them
in case something goes terribly sideways
and i'll i'll make sure that the good
doctor
doesn't get into trouble while we're
shopping for camping gear
listen i i need some better rifles for
the um
hippopotamus and whatever else we're
going to uncover here so
i'd like to take care of that as well
well we can we
we can take care of that but i mean
right now we're just getting shopping
our camping equipment i believe the
director is going to buy a rifle for me
he has no idea what i mean
some other things no i i'm not
completely ignorant about guns i can
i can look for the right border for you
i i'm very skeptical of that idea that
you actually
know what you're talking about the
rifles i've seen here
just because i don't shoot them doesn't
mean i don't appreciate them
uh you're pretty much gonna get whatever
the safari company gives you anyway
you know i'd like to look through what
they have and pick the best ones
let's make that a separate a separate a
separate thing you can get whatever
rifle you like a fine rifle they will
give you
but but we do if we are going to
split the group i would like somebody
who has a little bit more
talent with the than myself i'm going to
say testosterone but okay
[Laughter]
british they're they're very they're
very uh
civilized towards the ladies they're
super civilized they don't say anything
everything's fine everything's great
well then why are we going to go talk to
them
all right so who are two locations would
you speak to well the two individuals
are once again
so you have the the soldiers
uh and you have the governor the
government
minister he's technically colonial
undersecretary for internal affairs
all right i don't know joan who do
you prefer actually i'm not going to see
the british military sitting scratchbox
ah
you're gonna get you guys gonna go talk
to roger corrigan yeah
sounds like a wonderful child all right
um
uh so corey then let's see was he
mentioned
yeah so he also was mentioned by since
emma rolled a freaking one on that roll
or a six on that role i think it was
uh he also was mentioned by jackson
elias so jackson
met with him as well he's a
you know he's a a stuffed shirt
yes i'm given to understand that you
yes yes dreadful business that dreadful
business
yes
well yes it was uh
it was investigated by the ministry and
uh the affair has been
closed we uh
we we some nandi were hung
though doubtless many more matters
many more
escape to deserved punishment but you
know we
how many are the carlisle expedition how
many dead were there
well the entire lot well how many is
that
well that's a complicated question you
see
um we didn't recover bodies
as much as we recovered pots hmm
how do you know it was them then what
did you identify the bodies
uh well dr dr starrett
performed some some
uh post-forensics examinations he's
uh he runs the local christian school
and is a and also as a doctor and he
uh he was able to ascertain information
from the remains
that positively identified them
both circumstantially and otherwise
oh wow all right well he sounds like
somebody that uh
that would have more information about
what happened to those poor people
but were um
how did they report it to you how did
you get
well when the bodies were found by
the soldiers
the ministry was
automatically engaged in a full
investigation
okay
yeah they're not recovering the bodies
but just parts wow
they figure out what kind of animal or
what what
well apparently it was responsible that
it drives them local tribes man
yes it was it was savages it was okay
well i mean i just you know i was
thinking since it was a polar maybe some
animals got involved too
and that's but yeah it was just the
savages
hacking them what sort of weapons
were talking about here
yeah oh i'm sure i don't know perhaps
uh the soldiers might have more of an
idea uh
you know i frankly i saw one
photograph
of the of the location
and i did not need to see any further
it was an appalling sight
well they murdered in their cop while
they slapped her while they were walking
on the trials
what's the story well
they did not have a safari crew with
them
and so apparently
those savages stole all of their
equipment the bodies were found quite
well the pieces were found
uh with with very little equipment
anywhere nearby
i mean that's you know that's in keeping
with the modus operandi
and they're confident their composite
gradient is that that would you say
well it's inconclusive it could be that
they were
set upon whilst they were traveling and
they were torn apart and they were it
could be they were brought from
somewhere else
um unfortunately we have very little
information about
the actual event the the the
the five gentlemen who um
the five gentlemen who confessed
to the crime unfortunately did not
offer
any further details before they were
right gosh
so so their bodies were not found in
their camp
and then the camp itself was never found
well again it is our estimation
that everything from the camp was
scavenged
they were killed for whatever goods they
had
wow it's just it's just wow
it's just interesting that that they
never found where the camping
or the camp was was there any indication
where they were going
well no they did again they since they
did not have a safari they were actually
far off of uh
the usual routes that the safari
companies keep you know the
safari companies most people don't know
this the safari companies
uh pay the tribes a rather hefty retreat
a retainer not to bother their
customers that's good to know thank you
and they have various
uh agreements with the tribes to not go
in certain areas
it's why we greatly frown upon uh
uh non-sanctioned safaris
want to make sense but this was a
non-sanctioned area that we're in
somewhere outside the usual
safari locations that's correct yes no
guard company and no plan routes
no no we don't require now
obviously we don't require english
citizens to tell us
what they're doing every every step
of the way
um it was made clear to us that they
were on safari and that they were headed
out
uh and that they chose not to use a
company
uh i'm certain that someone at hampton
house
gave them a strongly worded suggestion
that they
uh secure the services of
one of the legitimate safari houses but
they chose not to
so where was this era they were found in
this kind of place off the beaten path
well nandi lands are to the north from
here
uh a good ways somewhere
between mount
uh what was it mount something in mount
kenya
of those two mountains i mean is there
one that's more of a
location than the other that people
would like to visit
for whatever reason well mount
kenya's larger it's quite it's
mount kenya is we're very proud of
this mount kenya
you know mount kilimanjaro gets all of
the publicity
mount kilimanjaro is let's see here
what is the
uh it is indeed quite high but mount
kenya
is 17 000 feet in elevation which is
most that is impressive
uh and do either these mountains have
any sort of terrible
uh native problems or dangerous places
where you would not recommend
the tourists travel to well yes both
all of them i mean it's nandi land the
nandi are uh
uh a particularly uh
have been known to for forego
all civilization all civilized actions
and uh
and do things like rip the odd
the odd caravan of god fearing
but if they had been with somebody in
that area if they had been with
a safari in that area they would have
been fine because they have that
agreement or is this just a
non-agreement zone
well if they had engaged
a legitimate safari company they
probably would not have been led
that far into nandi land yeah understand
understand all right well that's
all good information about that so
any anybody else have questions anybody
i'm
i'm happy to help you might uh
you know you might look in with the
king's african rifles
and the the soldiers who actually
find it they
they might have more information than
others but if the ministry can be of any
assistance
of course we're here to serve
even to the irish oh
would you would you be able to introduce
us to them so we're not just
walking into their area
i could write you a letter of
recommendation uh
but i i should
perhaps neither of you apparently are
military
um of course the um
the ministry and the army uh
have something of a a very
collegial but
um somewhat competitive relationship ah
understanding all right i i wasn't sure
so i thought i'd ask but
thank you thank you for your as i
said i'm happy to write you a letter of
recommendation
um i unfortunately of course
uh tragically lieutenant selkirk um
has passed away but i'm sure that you
can
find information about the other men
that were involved
there yes a real shame about the
fight the the uh
the mysterious fire that he died oh no
a fire yes we're nowhere near
wrong oh
that's so sad oh well well maybe maybe
some of his his compatriots would have
some more information
yes i i think that's that's fair to say
i'm sure that
um i'm sure you'll be able to find some
soldier there who was
uh intimately involved well thank you
again
uh yeah so government house is very
close to the military camp so you can
like
head to the head to the thing uh
not excited about this george
um and you get you get shown in fairly
quickly
uh to a conference to a an office um
and captain montgomery is there and
um he when he comes in he introduces
himself very formally he actually gives
you both a card
with his full title on it and his uh
and his mailing address and um
i yes
uh my name is captain gerald
montgomery
and i understand that you are
interested in the carlisle expedition
yes very much so well
that was a tragedy yes it was it was
well i am very happy to offer my full
cooperation
uh in any sort of investigation what
what is the source of this investigation
are you writing a
book it could be
uh yeah well we weren't we didn't want
to
broadcast but we didn't want to say
but yes
i'd like to write a book about it
i i i have written several books about
ancient history
but this seems like an a mystery
of modern times that i could
it's not it's a tragedy at least an
interesting story
a tragedy yes of course it's a tragedy
but it's not a mystery
oh oh i i thought there were some
things that were unresolved so that's
why i was trying to dig a little deeper
rich idiots went wandering off into the
belt and went somewhere they shouldn't
and were torn apart
by incredibly territorial tribesmen
what can you tell us about this
tribesmen to the north
are fierce fighters as i said
they are reluctant
they've had they you know they've had
a number of issues with the maasai
and the other tribes that are part of
our colony
uh that again goes back to the whole
understanding so um
as as far as you know or anybody who was
there it's like
this the expedition went someplace they
weren't supposed to go
met these fierce warriors
and were killed and that's that's it yes
that's correct
in fact this would be entirely
not notable if it weren't for that uh
that
carlisle woman who showed up and kicked
up such a fuss
and forced us to send out search parties
someone's sister i gather i'm
oh carlyle carl i've you know i've never
you have any idea why they would go
north when no one else
goes north none of the other safaris or
the other individuals there's
other animals up there particularly uh
ruins or whatnot to a touristy group
where they could go any direction but
they chose this direction
well i have found that
when rich idiots decide to strike off on
their own
they rarely know exactly what direction
they're going
uh chances are they said oh look a
mountain let's go
there and started to go there and didn't
realize that mountain lie
deep in dangerous territory ooh is that
a special mountain to the tribes
uh i refer you again to the fact that
this tribe is
absurdly territorial the entire area is
special to them
an archaeologist who enjoys looking at
ruins and things like that i'm thinking
maybe that's what they were trying to do
uh was there is there something out
there like that from ancient
no this part of africa
is not we're not
egypt there are not massive temples or
pyramids or that sort of thing
around here this is much more uh
there's very little
stonework historically okay
there could be caves in that mountain
i'm
this is all conjecture on my part of
course
all right i wasn't sure how much you uh
and your crew were affiliated with
the area
i i understand that it's a little scary
well i mean a third of our men
as we showed up a third of our men were
struck down with
it was some sort of tropical flu like
thing
uh it's it's it's fairly regular
for westerners who come here to get
sick at some point
there are various tropical maladies here
that
uh all you have to do is get bitten
by the wrong
bug
it's good to know what precautions do
you use
uh i don't leave nairobi well if
you were at the field what would you do
well
sleep with mosquito netting for certain
uh travel with a reputable safari
crew or with a a military escort
that'll keep the bugs away from you
well the mosquito netting mostly
right
oh and we we were also led to believe
there were some
of the men who are here who who found
the poor unfortunates
uh yes yes
i can i can uh
set you up with sergeant bumption
one second uh
and he will uh
he will go and he will bring back a
kind of brow beaten
uh sergeant who looks very
concerned
uh and right well
bumption go ahead tell them uh
tell them what you've seen well it were
right horrible
i see nothing to match it bodies
everywhere not bodies mine but bits of
bodies
and out here and on there torn to shreds
like you would a newspaper
something grabbed those poor buggers and
chewed the l out of them begging your
pardons
you would have thought the jackals and
buzzards would have ate them down to the
bone by the time we arrived
but the locals said the animals don't
even go there they shy away
and wouldn't touch the free meal even
animals get bad feelings i'm thinking
well i've never seen such a thing like
that no sir
it was terrible i've me own self found
the head of hypatia masters
oh oh
well thank you for for for telling us
about this but
i mean so no animals touched them that's
interesting
there was a special place or a special
cursed place or something
well fun and he looks at uh
he looks at montgomery and montgomery
says
speak boy speak well
uh if you ask me
these tribesmen were doing something
awful there was some sort of cult
or something like that this has order
makings
what good observation good observation
no
no it is not a good observation it's
ridiculous
oh i've seen i've seen things like that
from other cults
that i've looked at into
different religious cults to do some
very crazy things especially in these
yes well if that is your interest
then i'm not sure that his majesty's
military has any information that can
aid you this was
that makes sense that makes sense but uh
you know if you're writing
you're writing about it you want to have
a little bit more of the uh
interesting parts so thank you very much
any idea what they call these fellas
what their religious religious bent
is out there or the cult yeah do they
have a cold name
some thing they're worshiping or whatnot
like a
you know we've not done any sort of
anthropological
study of them we tend to keep them at
bayonet's length
well it sounds like bunsen do something
well i mean i don't know any name or
anything and he's looking at the uh
uh at his commander all
i know is you know that it's my
entirely my opinion that this was some
sort of cult activity
i don't know what cult or even if there
is a cult
oh okay you haven't heard about the cult
you just just okay
i was wondering but that that fellow
who was here a few you that jackson
elias fella
he he told me all about these cults
ah
okay i was wondering where you got
that hint from yes we are familiar with
mr elias what was his third you remember
what his theory was or what the name of
the cult might have been his theory was
poppycock
well we're trying to look at all aspects
of this and then if you have any info
about what he was talking about that
might help us find somebody else
to talk to mr elias met with us for one
day
and seemed to be preparing to head up
north
to examine the area he was
trying to find a reputable company that
would take him there there was
no such and
did they make him by himself
oh no he was on a train he returned to
mombasa
right that makes sense okay
so bunching he didn't he didn't mention
any names or anything to you that you
remember
no he may he didn't he asked me
questions
i didn't ask him questions okay
appreciate it thank you thank you for
letting us talk to uh
uh the sergeant of course i'm i'm only
two
we we we are firm believers
in the right to speech yeah yes
no matter how asinine it might be
and very appreciative of that
you're dismissed sergeant
thank you sir and he will make it
through now
may i be of any further assistance to
you
yeah i don't believe so anything else
john i can't think of anything else
right now appreciate it uh
yes of course
all right all right so
uh you guys the other side of the
team
you are shopping are you trying to set
up with a safari
uh crew what are you i i was just saying
shopping as
an excuse i'm gonna go get that telegram
to rogers i mean
i will look for a jeep or something like
that
just because i don't i'm not convinced
get a safari expedition team to help us
get to where we want to get
so i think we're on the road and i keep
badgering hollister to be like
look we got to find somebody to take us
um so you can easily find one of the
you know one of the sort of second-rate
uh
safari crews will definitely be like
yeah we'll take you to the bad place
the bad place but more important
uh alexandria how are you feeling
i was wondering how long it would take
you to get around to this
well
yeah you weren't in a you weren't in a
i'm gonna glance around to see if anyone
is close enough to hear
the situation that was being dealt with
in the dining car
was supernatural and beyond my ken
and i handed control
over as a way to try and deal with it
that doesn't quite answer my question
though how are you feeling
like myself slightly taller and broader
than i am accustomed
what other choice is there
not any good ones okay
for for whatever it may be worth it's
only another six months
you plan to go past that yeah
there's there's no point in planning for
failure
it's not a it's not a healthy mindset
i'm not planning for failure
i just know how big this task is and how
long it's taken us to do
one of the multiple things that we've
needed to do
i'll fight i'll fight to the last second
i always do but
okay well if you if you ever need
anything from me i'm here
i appreciate that you're one of the few
people i let dig around in my brain
so for whatever that may be worth to you
all right let's send a telegram yeah
because alexandria's brain is one you
want to dig around in even when there
isn't an evil egyptian queen there
um so i assume you're just saying like
contact me in a mirror
i'm he told me to give
him our location once we got there
um and what code to use so i'm
sending a pretty abrupt
i'm i'm giving him exactly what he said
encoded
okay perfect perfect
then let's let's look for a jeep so
um
you're gonna need to like hire a service
to get the
all mo the jeeps and trucks are being
run by the services
now you can find a super like the super
bargain basement one is just like
yeah we'll send a guy out with you as a
guide and you'll have two trucks you
drive them yourselves
you know like it's essentially just
to be your hunting guide and they will
give you like all the equipment you'll
have to set up your own camps you'll
have to you know all that stuff
but but they'll they'll take us into the
bad place
what do you think about them go with
them or
look for someone else oh we might as
well
so you meet this um
older man with a huge like walrus
mustache
and a basset hound this like super
sleepy basset hound
um and he introduces himself as
creighton
any any he he says how do my name is
creighton
i you know i i've done did several
tours in india
so where where do you want to go
[Laughter]
we were thinking about going a bit off
the beaten trail if you're okay with
that
i love it i've heard there's a talking
gorilla
what
a a talking gorilla yeah there's there's
rumors
of a talking gorilla in the jungle
where when oh did you just
where and also yes since when
uh hollister you can make a psychology
role
i mean you say that all the time
can he though god god
did you fumble these dice did you fumble
yeah of course i fumbled outstanding
this guy tells the truth
all right listen to everything he says
unless ezra says he doesn't tell the
truth
tell me what i believe this guy knows he
knows
you've heard stories about the gorilla
he knows about it oh i've seen the
reports
yeah you've seen the reports this guy
knows
uh alexander it is clear to you that
this guy is just like selling a story
to like you know give you guys something
we'll talk about this later yeah i've
heard of
the story of the gorilla oh yeah
fascinating
trying to find it is that what you're
hunting for
a talking gorilla not originally
go off the beaten path right so the
talking gorilla
i think is to the north
i might have to take you into some
dangerous lands there the 90
can be a little you know they can be a
little touchy
so arm up is what you're saying oh
we'll bring the guns don't worry there's
guns bullets oh they don't really
understand guns but they very much
understand bullets
and the direct application of such
wow yes that sounds like a
fascinating thing to go hunting down
great we're leaving tomorrow
we we we need to confer with our with
our fellows first it may be tomorrow
maybe it will probably be
day after tomorrow non-refundable
deposit
well we'll come back when we know the
time and we will uh
look i could get another offer you
i'm calling that bluff you don't we'll
be back tomorrow
or or or more at least later today we do
need to talk to our fellows
it's gonna cost you more every day i'm
gonna ex i'm expecting
uh to get some information today so we
have to wait
or possibly tonight we have to wait for
that all right
you know how if the money's being wired
through all that stuff like we
oh that's very important yeah you pay
you with nothing so you have to wait
until that happens
i'll learn that the hard way um
all right yeah oh i'll wait here i'll
start getting everything together
you're a good man sir thank you i am a
good man that's right you don't forget
that
creighton is a good man lovely
thank you so much so yeah he's gonna
start like
putting together an incredibly
uh and yeah you have successfully uh
we are going to get our own guns though
not that i don't trust him all right
yeah it's
so there's no way that
uh alex chris can buy guns
oh no god no no but i can buy guns
so you can buy
shotguns but if you want real hunting
stuff you're gonna if you want the real
hard stuff you're gonna need an english
citizen
all right oh my
that's me yep yes it is
yeah donald donald goes into like old
school wheel of fortune like his head in
a circle going like
for 500 i'll take that one and like
get in the candy shop yes
you are absurdly overarmed at this point
all right and i'll get extra weapons for
joan and dr hofstra just in case they
seem halfway competent or i just need
some help
uh yeah you you will easily get that
it's all
so it's it's it's mainly hunting rifles
uh and elephant guns those are the the
main things you can get
uh flint could fire an elephant gun with
no kickback
no now he could give me the stats on
that elephant again so i can add to my
character she
apparently apparently uh
creighton's gonna take you to flint
apparently yeah he's met flint before
he said he had an idea of where it might
be he was
selling us a tail but it's taking us in
uh all right so anything else
happening
uh today for the 18th anything else you
want to check out
anybody we should go to a museum talk to
somebody who actually does anthropology
or studies on the tribes and find
something out
actually about the tribe as opposed to
just just
wandering into the dirt you know without
any clue
you would know given your unique
job that like the missionary
the the christian school that doctor
might be
the you know he might be one of the best
sources of outreach
because there's not a lot of
anthropology going on
okay go talk to his experience with the
tribe
sure so um
dr horus starrett is
uh he is
uh he is your stereotypical like
uh shirt caller a parish priest
uh protestant are you going by yourself
are you taking people with you
that's up to you guys i mean because
i'll go because i that's he was on my
uh he's at the hospital and mission
school they are combined
in a healey town um
and he'll
he'll he's happy to see rich white
people
rich appearing white people um
and he he easily makes time and he
serves tea
uh yes hello uh
how could i help you good afternoon
sir
hang on dr sterritt
ah doctor may introduce dr joan lamb
doctor and doctor doctor
nobody wants to do spies while he goes
with me back up or we were
told there would be no math i think we
joined back up
yeah everybody's all together now yeah
doctor
doctor i almost went canine there
you know you know that's that's yes
so we were i'm interested i'm following
up with some information my good
friend jackson elias and i do this again
my good buddy jackson elias he was
interested
in and he was preparing to follow up
on the carlisle expedition
and he was interested in going to the
nandi lands
and i understand it's very dangerous but
i
just wanted to like speak to somebody
about your experience there
is it is it as dangerous as some people
say oh it's quite dangerous yes
very dangerous and because just because
they're a warring tribe i mean what is
i mean have you spent time with them yes
i i
i traveled north to try and spread the
lord's word
they were they were politely resistant
uh and asked us to leave rather
expediently
at the end of a gun expediently or
i don't think they have guns it was
spears mainly spears
okay and when you were traveling through
that region what um
you know what what was what were some of
the practices did you see anything that
that would indicate any sort of
religious ceremonies
oh well i mean they
they had their own religion of some sort
it seems uh
i i must admit i
i didn't do a ton of research when
they were not
uh when they were not interested in
following the righteous path
uh we we decided to move on
ah and did you speak to the tribal
leader who was that
well i spoke to um
i've spoken to several people about the
nandi tribe uh
i tried to they have an elder that is
much respected by them um
old bundari and i i tried to speak to
him
uh this is before he seems to have uh
gone to ground
uh as the as the separatist movement
increases uh
well he's very difficult to find now but
he was very interesting old man spoke
mainly in riddles didn't understand
how did you get an audience with him
well he he had uh
uh he has a great respect for man of men
of faith
how could could we set up an audience as
well
probably um
it might be more complex now as i said
he seems to have gone to ground
do trans people live in the city
you know are there any tribes people
well that's a complicated question
uh nairobi proper tends to
not have the same tribal issues
that the in the the
but you know there are certainly uh
there are certainly those within the kca
who who
have connections to the nandi and you
know there are
there's rather open speculation about
the role of uh
uh old bundari as a connection with
uh kenyatta johnston and the kca
what do you mean is kenyatta johnson
uh kunyota johnston is one of the
leading
uh kenyan separatists he has
started a political party the kca
the kikuyu kakuyu central action
yeah and kikuyu that's the the name that
yeah our friend right yeah that's that's
the tribe
no that's the the the political yeah
the kikuyu central action committee or
or
central action is the group that she
thought might have had something to do
with the train
okay then i've been trying to frame it
as that was part of what right
then who's the tribe the truck the nandi
are one of the tribes
in kenya okay and and
and dr sterritt will explain that the
kca is trying to bridge those tribal
uh gaps and create
and he has an office in nairobi
yes the the kca has an office here in
swahili town
okay okay
well if there's anything else yes i
understand and i know this might you
know
that you did the forensics on the uh
the party when they came back in the
carlisle expedition
uh yes oh terrible
terrible tragedy that no and and
you were able to to piece the bodies
back together figure out how
who they were and how many of them there
were and all that
i'm fascinated by that i heard that
they were
cut up beyond recognition
uh yes that is the case and i'm
afraid you have been
somewhat misinformed i was not able to
stitch the bodies together there were
there were no positive identifications
made of
any of the bodies it was quite
impossible
i thought that they found her well i
believe
one of the soldiers said they found her
head i understand i was only brought
some
as far as i know there's still various
parts
but they gave you enough that you could
tell there was at least one part from
each person
because they said that you you certified
and said that
these were the people and hear who they
were
well without a barrister present all i
i certified the information that the
government gave me
understanding i examined the pieces
that were brought to me they were
representative
of a massacre of that sort
all right so you didn't get the location
yourself you was brought in
no i i don't leave nairobi
special about the pieces that you were
given were you
did they i mean would they were they
just like arms legs
things like that or is this amusing to
you
no no this was a massacre this was a
horrible tragedy
people just get cut into pieces i
understand that and
and yes then why do you use the word is
there anything
special about them what were the pieces
they brought to you they were not
boolean cubes no no no but the fact that
i understand that they were
taken apart by the tribe's people
one of the things that i've been
thinking about
is that what if they were trying to use
pieces of their body
it's hard to talk about it's really hard
so he's becoming more and more defensive
oh i know i understand that that you
know i'm not trying to say that you did
anything wrong but i'm trying to i'm
i'm trying to figure out more about what
happened
why writing a book
i i'm a doctor i'm a doctor of um
archaeology but i'm also interested in
more modern
sorry you're a doctor of archaeology
yes so i'm not a real doctor then
can i high-five him i'm gonna clear out
of the way between the two of them
because
not like a real doctor
i've had to go through the same kinds of
classes and working hard and being out
in the in the
in the hot sun and finding uh
and and writing about what i found doing
research what do you mean not a real
doctor i think it's pretty
self-explanatory
i mean you don't have to sew people back
later
that later no i
i do have to to look at pieces of things
that were people
and try to put them back together
puttering no that's when you're just
playing
throwing the bones around i'm not
throwing them i'm putting together
so we can gasp grasp things that were
happening way
before you were around so they can live
no
allister stop putting control on the
fire
okay dr hunt thank you very much for
your time i'm gonna shake his hand and
be like this was weird
thank you goodbye of course uh
i hope you found some pottery
[Music]
yeah i just wave i'm like bye thank you
bye
bye like as he's leaving he looks at the
hollister he says
you understand i understand yes
uh he'll actually hollister he will as
you like
he'll like motion you back and he'll say
just between you and me as a
practitioner
i will tell you this the body parts that
i was given
impossible no sort of preservative
salt on it it's as if
they had been it's as if they were still
living breathing human bodies but just a
interesting i would assume that the
the parts were burned afterwards
yes okay okay
oh that's incredibly disturbing
thank you for that information the only
answer
i could possibly think of was the devil
let's hope not hmm
yes well a pleasure doctor
absolutely have a good day doctor
all right on that on that
insulting note to one of the players i
think we're gonna go to break

no that's the area that we are in is no
we're in the indian area
the hotel is all is is all races not all
the places around here are all races
can they recommend any places that are

yep so let's let's go hang out in
swahili town see what we can find
we could always get indian food to go
throw that out there
dr hollister is eating some non as you
walk into
yeah he's a non-starter
uh you spend a a lovely night
in you're you're at a bar
uh at some point during the night
uh alexandra you see the same guy from
the train station
i was going to ask if i'd spotted him
okay and um
and he's like he's just sort of like you
know he's like trying not to look at you
look at you
um i am enjoying the fact that i have a
higher constitution in this body and
enjoying a few more drinks than
alexandria usually would
um so yeah i'm definitely like
watching him i am not watching him not
watching me
how's that i need a cough button
right can faster on that mute man
i guess so yeah yeah he's not doing
anything he's just like
looking at you not really looking at you
okay
i am i'm going to excuse myself to
attempt to go to the ladies room
okay okay i'm just just separating
myself out a little bit to see what
happens
yep okay so
actually you leave and this guy will
come up to
donald and hollister make me a luck roll
success five
oh all right so hollister you got the
better luck
this so this gentleman will come up to
you dr hollister
are do you know who you're traveling
with
i believe so would you like to
enlighten me
i'm i'm glancing at uh
i'm glancing at joan and emma
[Laughter]
[Music]
can i overhear this because i feel like
i feel like pulling on do you know who i
am do you know how dangerous i am
i'm not paying attention whatsoever to
holly nothing so i'm not even looking at
him
i'm not even looking at it i want to
talk to your manager
yo lean back they're both pretty
dangerous
uh don't think either of them are
royalty
come on so you don't
know who you're traveling with
[Music]
allister just tell the fellow you know
i have to go and he's gonna like start
to like walk out of the bar
i'll get up and follow and like could
have told us
come on no one's following me
okay all right so yeah am i supposed to
fall i just yell am i supposed to follow
you
what is happening you know who i am i am
more dangerous than all of you
all right so you you come out and the
guy is like
um when you come out the guy will like
stop and see you and he'll say like
you're you're traveling with with
that's not entirely accurate
yes huh we just came from egypt uh
are we there a lot of people around no
he's like he doesn't want to say this
out loud either
okay yeah i'll like if i see like an
emptier area all like
i came here i was at i was at a cotton
plantation
where i saw her killed
so i think it's more accurate to say
that you saw someone
who looked like her killed
that that's not a resemblance that is
and i'm looking back did no one follow
i i understand how that how this looks
you shouldn't tell anyone though
who can you i who would i how there's no
one i can tell
i fled that plantation that night
barely hanging on to my sanity i went as
far away as i could
well if it's of any consolation we're
just visiting and we
will hopefully be leaving in a while and
you can get back to your life please
don't tell anyone about this
i can assure you that she is not who you
polish hasn't gone for a while i think
i'm gonna go make sure he's not dead or
something
all right so about the time dog so as
soon as donald like opens the door
this guy like panics and he like looks
at donal
oh birds of paradise and he goes
he was there too so are you fella
right you are part of the
cult look i was
i was a plantation worker that got roped
into
whatever shocked he was doing
i want no part of any of that he fitted
you with a matching road with the rest
yes so you know
why you're ah
she's a monster yeah muscle you're
worshiping right and all your friends
no it's a different you're talking about
two different people
he knows hey that was hollister he
wrecked
he recognizes the form now he knows
what's going on here
well you come to this country of all
places in the world you could have fled
here you come to kenya
it's cheap i had no money africa's a big
yes and the woman you're traveling with
wants to rule it all
and maybe she will i think she'll melt
this back
uh but maybe you can make contact with
the fellows what are you doing no
shut up here no we don't need to be
drawing attention
i don't have any people here i'm alone
for how long i'm surprised you haven't
killed me yet
no it just made us mind i just stand
between them
you should probably leave now i should
yes if i see you again fellow
and you know what we know your liability
to us
i just went to a bar
i'm ushering him away now good seeing
you
uh he will like skitter off oh sir why
well he failed his listen role just the
look on hollister's face was worth that
what are you doing it he was just
confused
he's on the confuse he knows exactly
what's going on no he doesn't he thinks
that she's
she stands out like a sore thumb man
i'm gonna come out of the out of the
bathroom and look and come back come
over to the other girls
there's no one else on this entire
concert that looks like her
nobody ollie went outside he saw he saw
somebody he went outside and donald
followed him
calm down yeah so the guy who was
following us at the train station came
up and said something about do you know
who you're with and then they ran
outside then donald ran after them and
you know what i need another shot
because
he was trying to warn us he wouldn't
have done that
uh he he's a former cultist of of knight
of chris
he's trying to warn us that his mistress
is still alive he's scared of him
he's a citation worker she came in out
of nowhere
you know what she did to anyone who
didn't do what she
what she wanted when she showed up yes
the problem is here not anywhere else in
the world and he happens to be here too
it's too much of a coincidence you know
this
maybe but i don't think he would have
come up to us to have warned us about
her
well he wants to know
oh i'm going to go back inside and drink
if i kill the fellow
you want a problem with it all right
that's probably too late he's gone
let it go let it go we don't need to
cause any more trouble in our time here
that's a good involvement we've only
just been gone
one day i want one day one more day
today's almost tomorrow keep forgetting
who i'm playing
i will buy you a bottle of scotch if you
can just
go for a day this today count right
today we have until midnight
okay till midnight you have a lovely
evening
uh and that that passes without any
really because donald's fuming about i
haven't killed anybody yet today like
he's like marching around and we're like
shut
up like and i'm still
holly when they come back in i want to
know what the hell
happened oh he recognized you
he wrecked well he recognized your body
they recognized you know what you look
like
and exactly what is that
he was in egypt and a plantation
happened to see the hell there
you know just happens to be in town here
where the other cult is located
no big deal no coincidence is there
hollister
he approached us to warn us right
warn us what right that she was a
monster
i'm sure he's a good fellow you know
these cultists they have good hearts
all of them it's
[Laughter]
wait a minute we're giving so wait so
holly we're giving donald
shots now if he doesn't kill people
we're giving him a bottle if he doesn't
kill people
what do i have to do to get in on this
deal hang on to the waiter
so does he have to complete the day and
then we give him the bottle tomorrow
yeah okay i'll get the bottle tomorrow
hello at advanced just in advance for
do you have to take the bottle back if
he kills someone i'll give it back to
you if i messed this
sure you will empty
completely disturb people next to us is
we're yelling about like if you don't
kill
anybody an entire
but yeah alexandria will definitely tuck
away in the back of her mind that
someone was there
and came over to warn them when i wasn't
there that does strike me as being
interesting not necessarily odd but
definitely interesting
it's trouble we've
we are we are a walking
hurricane of trouble of course it's
trouble everything around us is trouble
um yeah and even even here it's trouble
if if you if you want to go and have a
fight with him have a fight with him
stop it stop being passive aggressive
just be aggressive
just just just shout it'll you'll feel
better
well you mean joan and dollister oh yeah
if you get a rumor or something nothing
right
i almost spat my drink damn you tom i
have to
i'm checking the mirror though

i mean did we want to get in touch with
the case
the yeah the kca and try to
no set up a legitimate meeting which
might not result in violence
against us i really don't want to deal
with political stuff because we keep
blowing that up whenever that happens
but it might be a good idea to see if
you know the fourth time's the charm
i could talk to some i know i don't know
about being a separatist
yeah well i'm gonna lock myself in the
room and i am going to look over some of
the notes that i have because
if we're gearing up for something i got
to see if there's any protection spells
or
things that i can i can do i know i
don't have the fast
reading anymore but if i if i look
for something specific maybe i can find
it and i'm just gonna
forget about these guys until until uh
it's time to go
all right wait i recommend to joan
before she goes up
look for something that would do that to
people
like i wonder if it was robert carlisle
and benay that actually did that to all
you mean that the the cutting
yeah yeah carlisle wasn't remember
carlisle wasn't there
right now okay yeah but that's what i
mean is that
i suspect oh that's it pen you sorry
where i was yeah on the plus side pen
he's dead now
so anyway that's that's what i'm going
to do while we're doing this all right
sure
uh so you'll find like silvano did have
notes about the elder sign stuff
in his in his notes there's also
some really interesting stuff about
time and time dilation and things
like that
that that is gonna take a lot more
study but you know as soon as you see
that that fits right in with your
yeah yeah you're working with joseph on
that and savannah was taking lots of
notes about it yeah
savannah was explicitly writing a guide
on how to learn magic
using the time spell as the basis
right at 11 15 you look in the mirror
uh and there's rogers
uh look um
we're having this is this i can't see
you and i can't hear you so i'm just
gonna
well i mean i haven't heard you yet but
can you hear me is anybody there
i tap on the mirror god
damn it come on aldridge
all right you can move to another room
it'll get better reception
um well listen i i have
the information that you sent uh
and the situation in egypt's gotten a
lot worse
uh the the english have pretty much
and we've uh
we've we've also found some some
troubling information
uh in regards to
what we think might be going on at gray
dragon island
the japanese seem to think
that stanford has some sort of weapon
and they're very interested so
you know do what you think you need to
do in kenya but get to
you know the sooner we can deal with
this great dragon island stuff
the better i have tried
with little success to get the the oss
to look at this it's
unfortunately not a part of the world
that uh
you know we're trying to i i we might be
able to get a ship out of the
philippines
to go do something but the the military
is just not in
doesn't see a threat they don't
understand i'm i'm going to keep working
on them so if you can get me
anything concrete about this weapon or
about what they're doing
uh that would be
you know i'm i'm trying to sell this in
a
conventional sense to them so if you can
get me anything about that
that will be that will be most useful uh
i'll look for your next telegram
god damn it aldridge get this thing
working
okay and the mirror like waves again
uh all right so it is like the it's you
know lunchtime on the 18th
all right does somebody else want to
talk to the kca was the 9th
oh my goodness i mean i'm i'm
interested
uh do you guys recall anything about a
weapon on gray dragon island well there
was the other report was something the
fact that they were going to use some
large
bomb to further along the process to
open up the
path to the elder god or what not it had
it had something to do with that that
power source that was on the boat
i think the green stuff blew up yeah
that's right yeah
the green stuff that made me feel really
sick it's a strange method
was that a meteorite or something like
that i don't know what it was but
whatever it was it was
not natural and kind of awful
right but remember that was jack
brady didn't isn't the fella who said
they had a
they had a bomb on there yeah told us
about the bomb
and he was concerned about them using
it as part of their ritual
this people process allow yeah to uh
tear tear a hole in the fabric of
reality or something
fabric of reality well basically roger
roger just needs some
intel he needs a reason so make
something out
i think if if we could get him
in touch with with brady
perhaps someone who can act as a witness
although if he says it'll tear a hole in
reality
it might not be taken as seriously what
happened to brady i don't even know if
he's alive
i thought there was a report that he he
went somewhere else
to build up a military force
i don't know it would have was
did they include that in any of the
reports
but i oh well then i don't know you guys
would have to tell me
i mean i thought he was going to meet us
on the island he brought the tank along
and
you heard what happened to the tank
right
nothing coherent i couldn't quite make
sense of that actually
a tank made out of body parts and flesh
that screamed
it's not actually terribly coherent it's
reason enough to bomb the place right
there again
yeah so the whole super weapon thing
that's that's a good reason
um at the japanese walnuts they have
witnesses right they they were there
they were not other people that were
there
they could speak about what happened on
the island i
they can they can speak about what
happened but they can't speak to a super
weapon that would get the united states
military
that isn't involved in weird stuff i
don't think
japan would be terribly eager to uh
convince us that we need to act against
them to get there first
so i guess all we can tell the americans
is the japanese are going to beat us
there
unless we do something that's not a bad
uh
that's not a bad way to go about it the
americans are certainly
eager to not let anyone else beat them
to something i mean the question is do
you want to turn this into a
we want to acquire the weapon versus we
want to destroy the weapon
uh the structure sounds appealing to me
i mean the the thing is is that we still
have to convince them that there is a
weapon
i think right now the attitude is is
they think that the
japanese are just chasing nothing well i
guess you just uh
verify the japanese intelligence right
roger just tell rogers what we told you
verify it somehow hollister well
verifying is the trick
isn't it well not really i mean it's not
hard to fly over the island and take a
picture of a flesh tank
well when the plane gets disassembled in
the air
that makes it a little tricky that pen
was able to disassemble the destroyer
and i strongly suspect stanford
is stronger than him or you end up with
a head
in your lap yeah on the side here on the
uh all right so some of y'all are
gonna go visit the
kca yeah okay i i actually want to go
along with that just because
i think it'll be interesting to see what
to see what the attitude is
all right um
and so uh
having you know actually having you
along helps
i wondered yeah it it opened some
doors
so you find a storefront
it's a little storefront called the
kikuyu central association
um and
uh you know uh
you are you you know you're ushered
in and when you ask to speak to john
stone
uh they will put you in a
they'll say sure hold on and you're
essentially like in a storeroom you're
like sitting on crates
and stuff and
about ten minutes later a a um
a tall confident african man walks in
and
uh i'm john stone kenyatta how can i
help you
hello sir pleasure and pleasure to meet
you
um
okay so is this player stepping back for
a second what are we here for
we're here to try to speak to
anyone from the nandi we're looking
for old
old bandari was was the person we're
looking for that
but also i i'll come out and say it
um i suspect that the
90 that were accused were completely
innocent yeah yeah
and i suspect that what's his name
slaughtered more
90 people at the site not okay
almost certainly so that's
that's what i would like to investigate
personally if we could get permission
yeah we want an introduction to go talk
to
what's his name so our so are we saying
then
that we are hunting down the carlisle
expedition
to try to find the truth of of what
happened right
and then the colonial government lied
about what happened we want to expose
the truth
we suspect that also
if things feel weird i would drop
uh you also still taking advantage of
that 01 that you rolled
know that jax and elias talked to him as
well okay yeah
um yes we we are
following up on a a
uh investigation that our good friend
jackson elias
was was pursuing i recall mr elias yes
i wondered if if he might not he is a
very
memorable sort of fellow may he rest in
peace
he is dead yes he passed away earlier
this year
i have a touch my grandfather was
uh what we call a muragi
a diviner he could sense things about
people
i have a touch of his gift i think and
as soon as i met this mr elias
and i tasted cilantro in my mouth
i'm so sorry that taste just does not go
away does it
and what is it are you continuing his
investigation yes we are continuing the
investigation
into the the carlisle expedition and
what actually happened
and trying to parse through the lies
that we believed
were being sold
and who are you ma'am my name is
alexandria hartford
because that's the only ident i've got
and you are american yes
now i imagine i have my passport on me
well you'll excuse me we do not get many
americans like you here
yes well
i imagine you don't and you are
following
jackson elias's tracks what
have you found about the carlisle
expedition
hmm some very
uh well interesting trials
we're we're trying we're trying to see
we were we were hoping to it to be able
to i believe that you
may may have a a friend in the nandi
lands
that would be ideal we were we were told
that that you
no one has a friend
named old bundari great bundarius friend
to none
great dari is leader to all
he is he is the eyes
then he sounds like someone who would
would know the truth and we would be
very interested in meeting him if that's
if it is truth you seek bhundari
will show it to you whether you want to
see it or not that is
is that truth
over the last six months we have seen
and if that is the the the truth that he
has to show and it has to do
with what happened out there then
we would like to we not like it is not
something we
enjoy seeking but it is something that
very well very well i can arrange this
meeting
uh
when you walk out that door and he looks
at the front when he
when you walk out the front door
you will see a gentleman walking he's
wearing
thank you very much sir of course
so yeah you guys head out whoo that went
better than i hoped
and there's a guy walking away with a
red shirt
and you follow him and he starts to lead
you on just a winding path through
swahili town
uh you are all you know you're
you're getting turned around uh
it's unlikely that anyone could follow
you and
are you going to follow him in yeah
all right inside is a truck
a large you know a big old truck with a
canvas cover over the back
and the guy in the red shirt is now in
the driver's seat and he like
at the to the truck oh you got your
truck allister
all right we have creighton for nothing
oh oh
i'll i'll give emma a hand up into the
truck
uh um
and he says he says
i will make your introductions but i
could not have anyone think
that we would go to that i would be
joining you
i understand the the need for stealth
and i'll glance over at donal
and so yeah you start to drive out and
um john stone says i should warn you
that
uh old bundari
and this tea is laced with some
fairly strong hallucinogenic uh
properties
i don't think it will be rude but you
will not
you will not you will not be afforded
old bundari's gifts
that is a choice you may each make
individually
all right thank you for the the
forewarning
so you drive for
a couple hours you are you are out of
town
you are out in the veldt like if you
look out the back
um you're getting a little mini safari
here uh
the roads are terrible it's bumpy
and an uncomfortable ride
um and
it's hot although actually it's it's
cooler because you're at elevation now
um so it's not as bad as the the
flatlands um
and in the distance sure enough you see
um
if you look forward from the truck you
see
the two almost like
you know they're so they loom so large
on each side you see the two mountains
uh satima on the left in kenya on the
right kenya
and so after about a three hour drive
you you stop in a village
there are huts all around and johnstone
says
and please leave
anything that might even look like a
weapon
in this truck i promise you
if you mean these people no harm you are
in no danger
and and alexandria will just like huff
out her breath and be like
clang cling cling cling clinton there's
only four
um
they're very specific knives is anyone
bringing either a hidden weapon or a an
actual weapon
you can count them as they come off of
her body some of you have never seen the
fourth one
but we long suspected would it have been
weird if i would have been carrying the
sword of Akmala with me the entire time
or is that not something okay in kenya
that would probably be weird or at least
it would be weird now given that the
sword of Akmala glows blue
all the time okay so it would
it would be with my things then
i'll take out my concealed pistol from
the back and set that aside and the
set that aside as well all right is the
crowbar coming or not
doane isn't here oh that's right joan is
learn to control your i'm sorry you
didn't want to be here
uh so you he will lead you out
to a small
thatch hut there is a weird greasy
smoke
leaving out of the emitting out of the
hole in the top of the
the hut and inside
is an old man
wearing a wearing a loincloth
basically
and when you come in he looks up and
like
his eyes it's not like even it's not
clouded they're just white his there's
no
pupils in his eyes uh
uh he's blind oh yeah but he's the eyes
of
all and uh
um john stone says something
but nidachris knows good for her
he'll offer to tran she'll she'll say
like you know if you let me be in charge
you'll understand what he's saying
that's all right
i i can muddle along without needing to
know what's going on
[Laughter]
uh and so bundari
will pour four cups
of this kind of
gross looking you were told
tea but you this is like a cup of soup
it's
thick and it's um
gritty and
uh and john stone will say to you
um bundari offers you
uh offers you a drink
i drank worse yeah thank you all right
yeah it's
it's it's it goes down surprisingly
and human really gives it the okay
and as as soon as you finish the drink
the first thing you notice is that you
can understand what bundari is saying
and that is
and that is why you grind the kidney
oh it looks like the tears kicked in
welcome children i am bundari
and you you seek the mountain of the
black wind
we do
i see i
who and he looks at alexandra
who are you
and
i understand what you wish to see
i can show you it will not be
present it will not be something you
want to see but i can show you
this mountain i can show you the
mountain i can show you how to get there
you must promise me first you will not
that you will you must promise me second
sorry i'm making these promises up as i
go
you must promise me second
that what you see on that mountain
never leaves that mountain again
that is our goal i think we can make
those
promises is something keeping you from
i am the protector of these lands of
they they they separate us
before they came we
we worked together the tribes were a
family
families fight but families always make
up now the english
play us one off of the other
they give the tribe that plays along
guns
my friend johnstone
i have seen the power of the work
that he will do working within this
system
now are you ready for the dark truths
that i will give each of you
not something that we particularly enjoy
seeking but
truths that need to be known donald
concannon
you love her more than she loves you and
hollister
you're sure you're doing the right thing
and that concerns you
and that doesn't concern you
but to do this
you will doom many many people
knightochrist
john lamb she will learn
and she will find in the end that
we haven't seen him in a while but
he has taught a new people of the
they seek to profit from these dangers
so-called civilized nations try to
this is not something that can be
appeased
and they will learn this at their great
detriment
and the last truth
a truth that none of you are prepared to
face
mount satima is the mountain you look
for
there
by the end of the ritual
she must be dead but if she dies during
the ritual all
now
you may either ask me
any question you wish or
i will grant you a boon your choice
what do you choose emma navarro
please please all right um
he from
somewhere pulls a small cage
and in this cage
is an eight-legged cricket
cool what do i feed it
this is my friend who is not what she
seems
what's her name who is not what she
seems
when
take her with you feed her well
you need but open her cage and free her
to be of service to you but remember do
not let her out until you reach the
mountain
of the black wind when you are in need
of a friend
okay
knight chris what gift
do you seek and all of a sudden
answer me this how
how do i gain control
self-sacrifice
alexandra hartford your choice
i have for you this rattle
this rattle the sound of this rattle
okay
what is hollister's first name i
actually don't remember frank
oh yeah franklin all right franklin
hollister
can you tell me where i can find
proof of the weapon on grey dragon
island
some proof at the mountain of the black
wind
but now almost all of the proof is on
grey dragon island
thank you donald concannon
what is your choice great one you
want to answer them on my questions i i
just um
i guess all i can ask for is a bone as
well
he pulls an envelope from somewhere and
this is the title to a small
cottage in a tiny village
in ireland
there is peace there there is
contentment there
um the hourglass is full of this weird
like glittery sand
and he says please give this to her i
think
it will help with her studies
i'll give it to her i'll take care of it
this is the service that bhundari may be
will will we be able to approach the
mountain
without causing trouble we don't want to
cause trouble with your people
my people do not go near the mountain
will we be able to pass through lands to
if they see my gifts yes
if they know that you have traveled with
me
good thank you
and the truck is like just rumbling back
alex you heard it that was just my
imagination right
and i'll reach it right i'll reach for a
pocket
to see if the the rattle is in there
it's there i'll pull it out
hold it up carefully not shaking it
my body lives yet but at what cost
i don't want to think about that but we
you'll free nighter chris it doesn't
matter
to be queen of africa it's what our
destiny is it's what's going to happen
lord
and i'll i'll say back in my head yeah
but it involves self-sacrifice
have fun with that i've died before
that's not necessarily what
who knows whose sacrifice something that
means something to you
what what does it mean by mother
i don't know my mother died in england
when i was a child did you know her
my mother yes i knew her not long but
i knew her martin you
i hate to ask i was an orphan on the
streets of london
when i was found so yes
very confident there were a lot of
sleepless hungry nights that prove as
much
what do you think he meant a fellow but
the mother
well there are more ways that someone
can be a mother
i suppose i don't know
we were told that he speaks in riddles i
suppose we'll have to go to the mountain
i think we have everything we need right
we just need to get joan and the the
things that we need to get out there
yeah but don't we have to wait for the
or is this one different you're the evil
i mean to do the to do the ceiling you
have to wait yeah the ceiling ceremony
has to happen at the full moon
we've got two weeks [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we were too
fast
well we can we can still clear the evil
away from there
and
two weeks to figure out how we're gonna
i and i'm assuming the ritual is the
same we need to find more
no because it's just the one lady we're
just using emuero
although how her blood is considered
innocent
damned now she's at the mountain that's
what he said right she's our
already there or at least that's where
we will find her whether that means
she's there now
or we will or she will be there when we
are
i imagine you have some politics there
i don't know what to think about all of
this we don't have some strange crazy
cleric priest or what not here to purge
all the evil for us we don't have any
i don't know emma did you did you learn
how to do that
what you got a cricket yeah i have a
cricket and her name
is who is not as she seems
oh we call her who not what got it this
ah well i suppose we should get this
hourglass to joan fill her in on what
happened and um
what i don't like waiting
nor do i are we sure i could have sworn
that it was on the full or the the new
moon
only the full one okay you can still go
there
yeah i mean you can go and like clean
stuff out or try and
reconnect her you know
we could just camp there until the full
moon i can't really
bear to wake myself but we'll go
tomorrow let's let's at least go and
have a look
and see if we can't figure out what this
mother business is about
that way it's less opportunity for us to
burn down nairobi
blamed on us as easily bear
all right so joan
they give you this they tell you all the
they give you this this sand
timer this hourglass barkley sand
timer okay
and when you
look at it uh
all of this all of the sand every grain
of sand in there
and as you look at it you start
reading it
and it says the cult was
was responsible for the carlisle mass
massacre
many terrible beasts were summoned from
the other sides
to kill and carry off the victims those
carried away were brought to the
mountain of the black wind
a terrible place shunned by everyone
it is so called because a dread god
inhabits it the beast
even the greatest spells cast against it
have no effect
once per year at the full moon the black
wind is unleashed
which brings plague famine and disaster
to satisfy the dark god the beast the
cult abducts villagers and sacrifices
them
then the god appears in all his terrible
glory
he is as tall as the mountain itself he
has no face
only a blood red tongue hangs down from
where the top of his head should be
monsters of all descriptions attend him
the mere sight of this hideous god can
drive
men mad the god's priestess is in weru
she lives in the mountain it was she who
prophesied the coming of the gods child
part human part monster who is soon to
soak the land with blood
ancient tales speak of a great sign the
eye of light and darkness
which could forever chain the cruel god
within the mountain
but no one knows what this sign might be
some magicians who are far seeing say
that the sign existed until until a few
years ago
when the god or sorry existed until
centuries ago
when the god tricked men into giving it
you guys get that he's been alive that
long
she the symbol in human form and then we
basically
change her back and she seals them up
again
so we're going to have to drain her
blood very slowly
i'm sure he'll be very happy about that
but into
kill all their followers and some dude i
mean no killing all the followers that's
obviously but no what do we uh
what do we put the blood into for the
ritual
just drip it straight out of her i mean
my god why do we have to go from a to b
to c
just go straight to like from being
we're not having to fill up anything
it's not the same
thing it's we just have to get her blood
out right
i have a horrible idea go ahead what's
the idea
well if she's the symbol now if she is
the
eye of light and darkness or the
capstone or whatever
draw it out of her squirt it back into
her somewhere
wow that'll be fun
[Laughter]
it didn't say anything about having to
fill anything it just said we needed her
blood
um
this is i mean it's theoretically the
same ritual the same
words yeah but we don't have the same
props the same words the same drum beats
but what do we see but what do we do
with the blood do we
spill it on the ground i mean what
happens drip it in
in the mountain do we need that i'm
thinking we need more volunteers
we have to find some volunteers it just
said we need her blood
just her blood yes that's her blood oh
thank goodness
now having other people chant to spend
powell might be very useful
but yeah because i got
but it might jonah's right it might
actually be in the mountain somewhere
that we have to put her blood because
there's caves right they said
apparently yes yeah so we'll need to see
what the the caves look like so
get going out there and reconnoitering
sounds like what we have to do
and if we run into emweru and we will
then abductor tire up hold it for 20
days
that sounds like no fun at all
we'll have to live out there then for
the 20 days there's no way we could
bring her back to nairobi
maybe a larger safari right
a few more supplies of innocent people
we need
we need to interview everyone who's
coming along
no it would be interesting to see if
people want to do some kind of
ritual as part you know going oh we're
going to go up there we're going to have
a cleansing ritual
he might have trouble finding innocent
people too yeah
but but we don't need quote innocent
people because we don't need their blood
we just need chanters you just need to
we cannot harm any of the nandi which
means we cannot invite them to do the
ritual
no no we need either soldiers or
other rich people
well we need believers is what's my name
rich people love cults
i'm saying you know if we give them a
thing to read
come on let's go do this oh
that would be cool around here or do we
go back somewhere else and find them
i think we i still think we petition
rogers he's our protection because we're
going into her home territory
we're going to the mountain where it's a
good thing we have more days because now
we have more days to get people
if rogers is involved i can't guarantee
that we won't be breaking promise number
one
we're gonna break we're not breaking any
of the promises right
we'll just take make sure that people
listen to us they're not killing anybody
give them saying that if rogers is
involved
can't guarantee anything no if they're
yeah they'll follow their orders from
rogers
absolutely
i like the religious people those those
worked last time so believe
you're on your own i'm not getting more
religious people for you good luck
plus this is a protestant place yeah we
have 20 days so we can put out
advertisements saying come join us on
this mountain trek and
we will take you there we could find
something like that
okay like what do we what what are we
there's a ritual with us and there's
mountain yeah for the end we have
an old african ritual that they can be
part of
and they can learn more about this woman
to death on that mountain
right that's what they're going to be
there maybe i'll lead with that
[Laughter]
maybe leave that part kind of behind
so it's there's gonna have to be some
some work shopping for that one yeah
boys and marketing they're gonna have a
hell of a time
have a hell of a time ooh
is it is it possible i know that we
we aren't going to harm these people but
maybe there are some
of the the local tribes people that have
a grudge
or an issue with inauro and the others
that would be willing to see
her undone so maybe she has some natural
enemies that we can
bring with us yeah you might be able to
talk to john stone about that
yeah he would probably be our best
contact
for for that dressing of course that
that that our goal is very much
not to hurt any any of these people
because absolutely not not a
and so we're not you know we're not
taking any of their blood
no it is entirely and then they'll be
they will not be the kinds of innocents
that we had before where we had to try
and talk around things
all right so it is now the night
of june 20th sorry yeah
what we jump forward today no it's the
night of june 19th sorry

um see you tomorrow so yeah
you you'll i guess you're going to rest
up
infuse yourselves with alcohol donald
you saw me a little bitter mood this
evening so so i did have one question
about this hourglass
um is it done now after it's poured or
so you didn't i no it it's i mean you
just saw the words but
it all comes out and then so that all
that was the words that came out in one
batch
yep okay we'll have to talk about more
batches
well so i'll just mechanically every
time you use the hourglass
um you're gonna get a day's worth of
reading done in an hour
oh that cause books all right okay
stay out of school kids
[Laughter]
you guys did tell me research is not a
shield medical school yes no we
absolutely told you exactly what what he
told us that
that you will find that you'll get the
learning that you're looking for but it
ain't gonna
it ain't gonna protect you but it's a
tool and that's what's important
i don't think they said that you can
take that away from it
i mean i i suspect that if hollister
says that jonah is just gonna be like
[Laughter]
uh so yeah you bright and early the next
morning you are off on safari
uh creighton has a truck as yeah one
truck
uh full of tents and all of your guns
he's you know you're very you
you've got really good taste in guns
and and donald has his bottle of uh
scotch yeah that's right yeah he didn't
kill at all last night i'm impressed
well i don't think it was too late it
was it was towards dinner it's not too
late it's definitely not too late
to buy a bottle where would i buy a
bottle of that late at night
i'm sure you can do it it was it was
only just dinner
yeah and i mean donald's actually would
share the scouts he was looking at a
pretty good
is that a luck roll to see if i could
find a place that's selling or good
you found something okay good all right
you probably stocked up because you
don't want to like not give him the
bottle and then see
you know he's like well now i get to
kill somebody yeah i should have some
spare bottles in case he's like all
this person i'm like
or a bottle of scotch
[Music]
porter um
so yeah you will head out and
um it's the the trip to satima
you will get um
fairly far the first day
and then creighton like will start
getting you know he'll start
working with you guys to get the camp
set up for the first night
and we make it abundantly clear to him
to not harm any of the natives that we
have a deal
if they show up call one of us we'll
clear it up
all right yeah i'm i'm i'd rather not
harm anyone
that's well i mean okay if we want to
shoot some animals
it's a safari is there anything you
really want to hunt
talking gorillas
they're endangered you know if we run
across one we'll talk about it
um capturing with them what would be
that would be awesome
uh so why do you want why do you guys
want to go to mount satima
i've heard those interesting things
there and the caves and whatnot maybe
even this gorilla that you speak of
oh well i'm i'm very interested
this will be a good story i can you
know maybe i'll bring more people up
here although they'll have to make that
deal with the
i don't you guys made a deal with the
nandi
is that mess with it the piece will
travel
well that's impressive that's impressive
yeah and to that end i do have the
the the thing with me
yeah it's not next to the crowbar
so are you setting watches or
anything
oh yes yeah so that's what we do
creighton will also take a watch
you know there's wildlife out here you
never know
those hippos they're fair they're very
dangerous
although the most dangerous animal out
here you wouldn't expect it
water buffalo ooh really really
they're mean what's the dangers more
dangerous than the hippos and the
elephants and whatnot
because they remember this is so
actually
so this is true we went to up in
santa rosa there's like a safari safari
west
and the like the the most high security
part of this safari is where the water
buffalo are
because apparently water buffalo will
just
trample you for doing something they
don't like
and they'll remember you and they'll
like they they they were they
i was telling stories about how like you
know farmers would get like
killed days later and stuff it was
so they're like they're more cautious
around
the darn water buffalo than they were
around anything else
in the safari i was hoping creighton was
going to tell us a story about like
the water buffalo that remembers him
[Laughter]
that's why they call them tick-tock
right yeah that's right that's right i
am
uh my beautiful wife has reminded me it
is actually the cape
buffalo dangerous thing
gotcha gotcha gotcha yeah it was really
funny
how like you know we're like oh this is
fun safari look giraffes
okay we're going in this next area make
sure nothing is outside the car we've
got like four gates we're going to lock
and unlock it all very
well it's all very strange uh
all right so yeah you will the next
day
you will come like almost
in a disney way like the landscape
changes
it's like dead you
you you cross like an imaginary line and
the vel
just dies and everything around is like
uh black and ah
decaying and there are vultures all over
the place
ew and creighton's like
so i'm i'm just driving to the mountain
right
all right right just just you know be
careful okay
slow down a little bit through here just
a little we don't want to stop i just
want to see if you see anything
incredibly
unnatural let us know
yeah this is this is crazy this is uh
this is not normal for this this area
oh you mean like like you've never seen
it like this before
i this is probably about as far as north
as i've gone
ah this we're going northeast this is
about as far
holster
yes just 58. yeah it has to be exact
right
that's still count yeah right all right
i was looking for three successes i got
three successes
um so about
one in the afternoon creighton
uh stops the truck and he's like
uh he'll open there's like a little
window to the back of the truck and he
opens it and he goes
um
i think you should take a look at this
right
and he'll like you know through the
little slit unless i mean or if you want
to get out of the truck
well i think i'd like to peek first
before i i'm going to look i want to
look before i leap
he'll like point over there and he'll go
still living hold on i'll hop out
all right you like you see like you
see where he was pointing there's like
pretty fresh black foot that has been
like ripped off of its leg
well we can't necessarily tell if it's
fresh right
i mean it's not it's it's a
non-decomposing potentially foot
that's the question it's a non-dd compo
it's a non-d
oh god it is a foot that's not
decomposing
stop trying to make up words well i was
going with nandi because you know
yeah well we don't know that for sure
this is the clever wordplay people tune
in for
so badly the vessel in the pestle is uh
so yeah you start to notice that you
are in a field
full of just like pieces of body
oh then there's no need to collect this
right here as a sample we can always
just come back
back in you are not starved for choices
uh is anybody else getting out of the
truck yeah
oh thank goodness i'm bad at this oh is
there something doing it do i see
what what what what you do what
what what is it when you roll all zeros
that's a
100 my friend that is 100
that is 100. what do i see so
you see about
a small black man gnawing on a hand
just
hasn't noticed you doesn't seem to the
the noise of the truck or anything
didn't seem to
i will back towards the truck
there
how to prepare you all
it's a cookbook it's just so special
holster what is the problem there's a
lot of body parts out there
oh more than the foot in and of itself
isn't too bad
but there's a little man out there
a man you sure it's not an animal
bloody cannibals i wish it was an animal
it's at that point that you
um you hear
uh you hear a noise you you hear
creighton go uh
guys uh
there's a lot of small people outside
uh you told me i'm not supposed to hurt
them oh
these are no these are i'm very
confident these are different people
should we show them one of our items
just see
drive drive all right drive
he starts the truck up again
and he starts to pull forward and you
hear like the straining of the engine
uh i think rifle time they don't want it
to move
apparently who wants to show them one of
the things i'm going to show them i'm
going to
i'm going to get up in the front and i'm
going to show them so
again to the front there's only a small
slid
you have to go out the back of the truck
you hear the front door open
can you hear creighton go guys yeah no
i'm going to run i'm going to run
i'm going to run i'm going out of the
truck yeah i'm going to have i have a
i i have a pistol which i'm not really
good at but i'm going to
no i have my crowbar i got my crowbar
and i've got my my
my hourglass hourglass and i'm
going
all right yeah i'm right behind her
i'm gonna jump out too so you like flip
the you flip the thing around
and you see the entire truck like all
of your vision around the truck
is ringed by these little three foot men
they're bald they're naked they all have
incredibly sharp teeth and they're all
that's where we're gonna end
i think this is gonna go okay i've got a
good feeling
uh so thank you so much for
the likes the bits the subscriptions
everything
youtube we love you if you're not a
member join our discord

uh all sorts of crazy stuff going on
there um
birds of paradise our friends there join
them
uh let's see our quotes for tonight um
uh when we can't stay here when we can't
stay here anymore because of things we
do we'll need another hotel
uh just for when we ruined this there's
no point in planning for failure i like
that one
that was like good advice we don't
need to cause
any more trouble while we're here we're
a walking hurricane of trouble
what they don't know will hurt them and
i think the name of the episode
rich people love cults
yes it's so true though
i think that is that is the name of the
episode
uh so uh
once again a full week two new shows
two new quests and chaos shows this week
uh
we've got sunday that's tomorrow by my
calendar
uh we've got pandemic legacy season zero
they'll be streaming at least two
episodes my bet is they play four
i'd like to that'd be cool that'd be
cool you guys will be january february
twice
yeah that's great yeah yeah
much faster yeah so sunday pandemic
legacy season zero
monday dragon of ice spire peak uh
tuesday it's election night if you by
the way
vote please vote i don't care well okay
i do care who you vote for
but more i care that you vote that's
that's the most important thing
and like do the research and vote in
your local election
because local stuff has a huge impact on
your life
and you know learning who is going to be
on your school board has a huge effect
on your life that sort of thing so
do the research study your local stuff
vote tuesday
is election night so we will not have a
game that night
um and then saturday in the afternoon
i'm given to understand two to five
although that sounded very preliminary
uh but two to five it's gonna be our new
show uh
rhyme of the frost maiden and again
worth it just for james and tossy like i
don't i don't even know who else is
involved
worth it just for them i think thomas
might be involved that would also be
delightful
which is exciting he never gets to play
does that mean amy's gonna produce
um probably yeah
thomas will just play and switch that's
right and then we are back here
saturday evening for figuring out
what these
uh cannibalistic pygmies are all about
uh i think that i think that covers
everything so there's nothing left to do
but say happy halloween internet friends
you
