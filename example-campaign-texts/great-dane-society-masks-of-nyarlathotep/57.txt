last time we had an interesting
dichotomy of haves
we had the first half of the game was
sort of a contemplative research
heavy
kind of dealing with moral implications
of decisions a discussion with a
a priest and
then the second half was hijinks
robbing a museum pulling a gun out in
the lobby
it was all sorts of crazy and
there are and as part of that hijinx
we met
dr henry clive
he showed up and
he knew something of dr kafur's time
magic and he had with him
a woman who seemed
who seemed to be able to see the future
it is late in the
evening
on the 29th of may
the full moon is the 6th of june
yeah we were able to retrieve the song
of the dole
and get that for right down well
retrieve they left it for us very kindly
um yeah yeah
they brought it back for you and i don't
remember if we told them
oh yeah i did because i i remember
mentioning the the eye spider and joan
being like ah
no thanks which appropriate reaction
yes they had some sort of there was an
eye spider that you guys took
uh pretty some uh
easy care of and then there was another
spider
that seemed to give them some
some sort of teleportation ability but
um uh
yeah so that is where you stand, emma
is beginning to drink herself into even
more oblivion than usual
like kind of side eye her a little
worried she's getting ready for talk
i guess that's how she gets her her
courage together
on
sunday emma is going to go to
the catholic church and try and convince
the poor sobs there
to join you in your quest
emma will tell you that
whatever you guys need to do
we can meet at like doshur and i can
bring
the innocent people there
well we'll need to take care of the
location first before we bring the
innocence to be
slaughtered outside the ritual of course
we're not
i don't think you're going to slaughter
them i i would prefer very much to
not but i i think i think donald's right
we need to
we need to get that cleared out as soon
as possible although the closer to
the full moon the more likely it'll stay
cleared out
so you have you you still have a couple
leads you you met
yesterday with nigel wasif who is an english spy and newspaper man 
also henry clive is up to something about giza
you're staying at a hotel
but you also have a u.s military base no
henry clive seems to be
newly ensnared in everything that we're
doing what
what's his game what's the reason he's
out here he's doing all this they
they've already awoken the black
pharaoh they've already their plans in
motion
what purpose would clive have to do all
this knight chris is destroyed
no no they didn't they the i forget
but i could have sworn that they didn't
want
the black pharaoh they wanted nida chris
black pharaoh couldn't be
couldn't can't be if nida chris's heart
beats so if they want to get
her heart beating that might be to our
advantage we might
i mean if if our goal is to seal the
black pharaoh
then then we might be on the same side
if we were fine conceding the existence
of naida chris for the
greater good right that's that's the
concern that i have
is that getting their assistance means
bringing back knight of chris and i
wasn't here when she was alive
but well their success would mean that
but their assistance
wouldn't necessarily we we have the same
enemy
is the important thing the enemy of my
enemy is my friend
yeah i thought that she was the console
to the bride or whatnot for the black
pharaoh
i didn't see them as opponents but of
course he betrayed her so perhaps
perhaps there's something there that
could be useful however her goal
apparently is the same as his army to
take over egypt there are the same
agendas
either one same situation yeah but one
of them
is an aspect of the messenger of the old
gods and the other one is
an old queen yeah a little a little less
bad
yeah we don't have to root for thrive to
we just need to work together to
to deal with a common enemy so maybe we
can persuade them to help
us while not really helping them is what
you're saying well we can
help them to an extent i'm just saying
if we both have the same enemy
we're we're helping fighting the same
enemy
i took a shot at clive so i don't know
if he's very much my friend at the
moment
i mean leaving that book for her on
purpose there's something there
a peace offering perhaps hitting taking
too much taking a shot at someone
doesn't necessarily mean you want them
dead
give me a dose and i can hold that back
of course if it turns out this fella's
he did mess us up though
but he also left us the book
that you specifically wanted he knew and
that's what gets me
he knew which one you wanted
well they had that fortune teller lady
whatever it was that she was doing
and who knows maybe she'll maybe she
knows we're coming to speak to him and
well again if they know that we're
coming to speak with them
with the idea of working together
maybe it won't be a setup maybe if i can
read into the future and read motives in
the future i don't
know well and we don't necessarily have
to be their friends we just have the
same goal
we just want the black pharaoh sealed
away that doesn't necessarily mean we
want nightcress out but it'll be easier
for her to come out if he's sealed away
all right
what else other than them what else can
we
draw from what else can we leverage what
else because i'm i'm thinking we needed
all the friends we can get
right you want to call okay i'm just
reading
the notes i had from that photo that i
left behind i don't know the cats myself
except i didn't know one cat
in china who was rather useful
we ran across a priestess of bast who is
able to turn herself into a large cat
um and runs around with the strays
maybe she would be helpful maybe
maybe like i said we need all the help
we can all the friends that we can get
so
all right so we've got clive we've got
the best priestess
oh nigel was safe wanted that
wanted to help us because he's a
kingsman and then nigel yeah let's go
check with him
yeah oh no i thought it was i thought
tomorrow was today
is this the morning no it's still the
night of the 29th
i think it's oh it's the evening of the
29th in case
you know anybody wants to do any
nocturnal tomorrow alexandria and i can
go see
nigel again perhaps joan you could
speak to clive and
i don't know how we find the cats maybe
we find one on the street and
say hello not sure how to find clive but
uh well he said he was going to be in
giza
yeah we should all go if that's going to
be the case yeah i'm not going to go to
giza by myself that's for sure
leaving cairo alone is a very bad idea
and i will
do it all right so maybe like in the
morning we can go see nigel and in the
afternoon we can go to giza
works for me sounds like a sounds like a
touring plan
all right all right so yeah you you wake
up and have a lovely breakfast it is now
and i should pick up some clothes
you know you want to spin this guy's
kind
you can you can find like sort of
a little bit native robes and
headdresses and stuff
no headdresses no headdresses
[Laughter]
i am i am perfectly happy to cover up
bright red hair so i'm not a beacon from
across a market
hard yeah that's a good idea let's get
some native looking clothing
all right yeah you will and you you
noticed
um you you recall that like um
as the egyptian government has taken
more control
uh like nigel was not dressed in his
english finery anymore he was wearing
more
native sort of things and that sort of
thing
so so yeah you'll spend some time in the
morning getting close
and then you'll go and you'll see nigel
he will once again make a show of
not wanting to talk to you and uh
uh you know berating uh
your your your your uh
berating your colonial ways and um
and then once he has you in his office
um i have uh
i've spoken to some of my friends
at the at the ministry and
they are interested in your ideas
about ways to combat the army of the
black pharaoh
they um
they have some resources they were
taken by surprise this
this rebellion sprung up seemingly
overnight
across the country and so they were
taken by surprise but
uh the the armory here in cairo is
very well so the soldiers here are very
well provisioned
um they probably probably have an edge
on the
um on the the the
army of the black pharaoh but they're
right wow they're playing a defensive
what can we do to help well they're
they're i mean
they're they're western help is a very
complicated matter right now
uh especially english help american help
is a little less complicated
it will yeah very help as well
obviously nothing official we could do
but but as i understand it so far the
americans are remaining
pretty studiously neutral very carefully
neutral
wanting to see how this comes out
wanting to make sure that that the
treaties
are still mildly applicable
yes we do have one man in the military
who may be useful
who can do some sort of things off the
books if uh
if it works i i mean
do you have the army is planning an
offensive
uh they they are going to they're
going to try and retake
giza in two days
he's under the control of the
it's not under the control giza is is
um something of a of a
a middle ground right now between the
two armies
we would like to we were actually
considering going to
giza ourself after this we think we
might be able to
we're optimistic we don't know but i
i sort of see i don't know what
allies you could find
in in giza but
uh i i i mean
i can tell you that in two days the army
is planning a
a major offensive to shore up
perhaps draw their forces towards the
area allow us an opening
what can we do to help that offensive to
make it more formidable
so make it necessary that the black our
black feral forces
actively engage it
i was thinking we would we would be like
a spy force ourselves right we can find
out some information maybe
about where things are where people are
and give it back
we should we should find out what the
situation is first right right they
might be fine having the military posted
there
in which case an assault is just a waste
uh doctor what we need is a something
to draw their forces
away from the area that we need to be in
and this offensive in two days may be
the useful engine wait
no so is it the egyptian is it the
egyptian military that's planning to
attack
giza or is it yeah that's that's not to
our benefit
we don't need the egyptians military
drawn somewhere
we need them fighting the black pharaoh
that's what they're doing they're
they're attacking no they're going to
giza well yeah so
the the the army of the black pharaoh
and and the the egyptian military
like giza is essentially like the front
right now so they're planning a major
offensive at giza to try and push the
army the black pharaoh back
okay so they okay which means that
that forces may forces of the black
pharaoh may be drawn away from where we
need them drawn from
right right that's what we need that's
exactly what we need so this offensive
needs to work
it needs to be something that's such a
threat that the forces of the black fair
have to act
and counter attack just like in the
well i i hope it doesn't go like the
great war agreed
just fighting over miles of territory
uh i want to give a quick shout out
since he has to he has to
have real life but jay matthews my
second favorite twitch user jay matthews
uh gave me a thousand bits thank you so
much jay matthews and
um always good to have you around he
said
even even if briefly even if briefly
um yeah so you can i mean he'll he'll
connect you
with a general at the ministry
who will meet you in a
like in know in a hiding spot that no
one can see
and he agrees that you know he'll
meet with you
uh late that night okay
so the late this saturday night he can
meet with you
at a at a the back room of a
restaurant
sounds good you've been seeing a lot of
those pyro
oh an old cairo great
so it's you know it's you you have a
you have a very nice lunch and it is now
uh
uh you know it's one o'clock on the 30th
so if i so have i misunderstood
because i was under the impression that
the clive expedition
wanted to bring back knight of chris is
that correct
they found her they found her body the
other items of hers
they had the whole thing ready to go um
her people brought her back to life with
the
sword of emma and whatnot and everything
fell apart on them of course when
the black pharaoh betrayed her and
destroyed yeah
donald you were there the clive
expedition you did
you did not see any of them at that
plantation
well i wasn't really looking for that
actually it's true you don't remember
a little bit you saw all sorts of
horrible things but you did not see
henry clive or anything like that
so who knows but they they were digging
for something separate
from the pen you so what do we so
what do we want to do do we still want
to try to
meet with them or are we just going to
let an assault like
what do we want to do because i'm
confused
can we can we wave away quite flat like
a truce what not to have a little
powwow with them and see if perhaps
there's a meeting of the mines here
we have the same agendas or not and if
not we'll kill them later
that's when we get to giza that's when
we get to giza we'll do that
right so then do we want to do that
after we meet with the general tonight
how about we do it right now but the
rest of the day
i thought we were gonna go look for
kitties
well and and and i did want to say kind
of a kind of out of character that
alexandria has been looking for cats
like keeping an active eye out looking
for any stray cats running around
downtown is not like downtown cairo is
not the place to see stray cats no we
have to go out
yeah yeah and better to do that during
the daylight hours
uh they're so it's you know it's a
short they're they're used to in in
non-wartime there's actually a commuter
train
in the 20s that goes out there so you
know it's
um it's an hour away okay
as long as we're relatively quick about
it but where will we find clive
he's he'll find us that's fair
perhaps that's true i'm
not we should be well armed if we're
leaving
cairo though we're always well armed i
just look at him
just very smooth face yeah all right
buddy
if we leave we're going to collect all
our stuff from the from the army base
and everything so
we always collect all our stuff in the
it's the hotels that are the problem
right
yeah something happens to our stuff in
the army base
anyway it's not like we have that much
stuff
so so yeah you're gonna so you're
gonna head out to giza
um by the time you get everything ready
and find a cart
that will take you out there it's
heading for three o'clock
and you
um you drive out you have a driver
and um
and you know you you come over the
rise
and there are the pyramids and the
sphinx
it is an amazing scene uh
as these towering monoliths that have
existed
since you know time immemorial they have
been around
forever i
say as a side like one of my favorite
things i don't know if you've ever seen
it but there are these um
there's like an internet timeline that
basically walks through
like what has happened in the space of
time that the pyramids have existed you
know like
how many how many like the roman empire
how many roman empires fit into
the time since the pyramid you know it's
one of those like
you know in the from today to when
the pyramids existed like here's all
these great
i love that stuff anyway um
so you come over this rise
um you pass through a military
checkpoint for the
army and as you pass through they um
uh they talk with the driver in arabic
anybody who wants to can make an arabic
role
all right oh good i forgot we did still
have someone who speaks arabic
uh that is a hard success
all right yeah they are basically
telling him that after
um you know once he if he really wants
to go out
into no man's land they can't you know
they they there are raiding parties
um and they can't ensure his safety
uh if he sees army units they they tell
him
to immediately wave a white flag so
that he doesn't get
attacked so you see like the driver
pulling out his handkerchief just in
case
all right and and you drive on and
the driver like asks where am i
taking you
um the car i can get you to
uh the valley of the kings but i
can't really drive down
into it there's not that should be fine
all right don't take any unnecessary
risks so he gets you to essentially like
the visitors
center of the valley of the kings and
everybody make me a spot hidden room
i was about to ask if someone has a sign
up with like one of our names on it or
something
so in the box so
yes hard success is that even a stat
what
so you with a hard success
you see a
a wisp of not a wisp you see a
a a line of smoke like from a small
campfire or something
that is coming off the top of the
we'll just just look at it and like well
artillery fire
or a campfire or a cow it looks more
like a campfire
okay i'll i'll nudge down and point
that's that's probably where we're
aiming
i don't want to climb that yeah climbing
this thing
is not fun they may have a
ladder there must be some ladders or
scaffolding or something set up we could
use
something well let's go find out
i'm looking around for less conspicuous
signs
um all right what what is an example of
a less conspicuous sign
are there any knight chris has a
symbol right
do i have notes on that any markings in
like that could be done in chalk or sand
or carved into something
um the sphinx is 66 feet tall
that is the shortest thing in the uh
the great pyramid is 455 feet tall
yeah but that that has
like little steps built in it's true not
great but
although the sphinx you know like you go
up on the feet and then you get up on
the back
yeah that's true so in between pieces
it's not quite so big
and and then throw rocks at the at the
um so you uh
you you you really don't see any
any sort of more surreptitious signs uh
nick as you come
walking in front of the sphinx
um it's it's it's ageless
and and and you hear
a voice a very from
very far away very faint saying
i have a riddle for you
as a joker your boyfriend's here
john
um no
sorry i didn't actually have a riddle
come up
come up it's it's doctor clive
henry clive we met yesterday
right no no we figured all right oh yes
no no
do we see a ladder or where
what's the easiest way to get up so you
can clamber up it is
um i don't we're not going to deal with
the uh
foot back yeah you you head make it up
on the back and then you climb up and
on the top of the sphinx you see
uh sitting there tending a little fire
with a can of beans on it
that he is heating up is dr henry
clive
all alone um
oh you know i knew you'd come
right agath is never wrong i i was about
to ask if agatha had told you we were
coming she did
she did i mean that's why i said i'll
see you i mean i wondered
if by saying i'll see you in giza meant
that i had thrown off
the future by doing that but instead it
appears that i just made it happen
thing really yes time is
fascinating your friend dr caffor was
doing some really interesting research
into the effects of time and how to
uh how to create
was that in the the the notes that you
uh got from him yeah in the books yeah
yeah all the stuff joseph boy
sorry nothing enough
nothing nothing so what's a ghost
need a can of beans for
well you know spiritual hunger is just
one kind of hunger
i've also got a you know there's a
physical manifestation
look i'm sorry it wasn't a good lie i
didn't have a lot of time you surprised
me
i went with the only thing i could think
we've we've run into some very odd
things a ghost would be one of the
least strange and and somebody who was
willing to help
you know that's uh
well now i know my i know better i've
learned my lesson thank you i appreciate
it
i'm gonna be honest yeah really we
are
at first we weren't trying to help and
now we are trying to heal
uh when we started here with the pin
you know after we followed in sir
robbery's footsteps
so robbery was was my my mentor he
was a great man he is a great well
it was he might be still a great man
he's not it's unclear he's his dad
will that uh
we could make it so you can visit him
i'm just like nudge joan in the ribs
we're looking for friends i'm already in
coast
my friends some of my friends were more
um okay with the unfortunate things that
happened
after um
sir robbery uh
when a little you know kookaburra
and i
and a few of our expedition
we're not so keen on human sacrifice and
that sort of thing
good to know so uh
we we hid
when something happened at uh
at that that criminals plantation
at that gang lords plantation
and the black pharaoh who is a very
unpleasant chip i'll tell you that right
now
uh the black pharaoh return
i was under the impression that we would
uh if we could make niter chris return
that we would have the find of old time
and we would have a first person
a a a primary source if you will for
egyptian history that was that was my
goal
now it turns out that uh
knight chris is kind of just as
bloodthirsty and crazy as this black
pharaoh character
and uh
you know there it appears their marriage
has been on on shaky ground
yeah yeah and so now this black
pharaoh character is trying to take over
uh so me and so agatha who uh
very useful she can you know she has
a very good idea of what's going to
happen
up to about 48 hours
ah that's useful though
it is it is unfortunately
uh there are some blind spots
uh and knightochris
is one of those blind spots as is this
black pharaoh character
so we don't really know what they're
doing
we know that there's something
uh they're doing they're concerned
about something with the full moon
wow and so
i have been well
you know i've had a day to look over the
necronomicon
luckily with this time magic that day
was actually about a week study so i've
i've made it through
a good chunk of the book and i've
figured out a good deal of what i need
to know for this
for some of these rituals that can be um
uh it can be pretty helpful with this uh
current situation i'm trying to figure
out a way that we can um
send this black pharaoh character back
where he came from
there are i've read some stories about
rituals
and what would you do if you did find
well that's what me and agatha and you
know the
uh there's about seven of us do you
yeah hold on he he knocks twice
uh on the head of the sphinx and
a a wooden
pallet gets pushed up and uh
and a and a head pokes out
and clive says
uh our guests here wanna wanna come in
it'll be it'll be cooler inside
let's go a little warm out here oh
you're going you're going
she's happy and sad and like freaked out
all at the same time
sure because of that guy yeah i'll i'll
gesture for
well no i i guess i'll go down first all
right
um so you're you come down and there
is a there's a
small kind of anti-chamber and in it are
two egyptian men with rifles who are
kind of like standing
an alert one of them is one of the guys
who poked his head up
um clive says to them in arabic like no
no these are our friends
uh and you go
down a a sloping hallway so
every this all of this entire area the
walls are just
covered in hieroglyphics
all right i'm trying to take it all in
sure sure it is overwhelming
uh you know do i get anything is there
anything that pops
uh make a hieroglyphics role or just
just total overwhelming
i i am i have got a hard success
there's a lot of imagery of
um some sort of army of
uh beast-headed men
um that have
you know that are that are sort of in
the
in the enthrall to the black pharaoh um
this is telling the story of you you you
find the story of the original caps
of the capstone being put on and
um you know there is
uh i'll have to i'll have to look at
this again before we leave so i can see
if there's any other
things i could pick out but i know we're
going fast right now i know we're going
fast
but i'm just like this guys i'm trying
not to touch it but i'm looking
yeah oh you know go ahead and touch it
it's fine i mean
i don't think that most of this is going
to be
uh well if things keep going like
they're going this will be the
you know whether we've ruined this
of a kind archaeological find is going
to be the least of our problems
i i still don't touch it because that's
not what i do
yeah yes it is i was gonna say
um so you uh
you you go down a sloped hall and you
enter there's about
uh six more guys um
uh you know that seem pretty well armed
uh
and agatha is sitting at a desk
and she's just writing like
feverishly
um and uh
yeah well you know agatha's the only one
uh the only
westerner left from the the
expedition the rest uh
the rest was sacrificed by the black
pharaoh uh
some of them willingly which frankly is
terrifying
but he's you know i think uh
professor lam there you saw
in the story there that those beasts
and they are some sort of
subterranean
uh creature that can come up out of the
sand
the stories of these creatures and i've
i've seen them once before with my own
eyes
well iggyth is writing so we should
leave it to that is she writing it i'm
just looking at over her shoulder is she
writing in english
yeah she's writing in english and she
got into the attack with the
uh the egyptian military yet that's
in
that's tomorrow isn't it well that might
be the day after tomorrow and she has 48
hours so i'm curious
it is not in there yet she is writing
fee you know she's
but as she has vision she's writing it
um dr hollister make me a medicine role
i think she's something it's a 95.
oh not a it wasn't a fumble all right we
can inspire it
oh yeah do it again do it again it's not
it's not a fumble you can inspire it
no no no if i statistically
if you fumble it that will be the best
emma ever i don't think you can get an
amy
didn't make it but it's not nearly as
bad all right um
there's you know she seems not well
there's something about her that that
seems physically
a reminder to hydrate she does not
respond
okay
um welcome deadboy42
who apparently is just starting out on
his journey of the great danes
because he says there are more guys
and less jackson elias than i remember
oh my it's been a while since you've
been with us then
you you've got some story to catch up
with my friend uh
thank you so much for thank you so
much for peeking in
yeah it's yeah
about episode 14 is where is where you
want to see where the change happened
that's where it gets good hey
it was pretty good before that but it
gets better
okay i think jackson will i think we
learn about jackson elias earlier than
that
oh wow that's right yeah episode wow
um i don't want to give anything away
but jackson elias is hitler
come on you just invoked godwin's law
oh my goodness
[Laughter]
uh oh he's listening to the he's
listening to the podcast well
tiana does all of the all of
the podcast stuff
uh nick have you done your new intro yet
yes
all right i handed him for it
we we had it before the second episode
with hollister
went up because i was like hey nick
you spent two weeks playing this
character you know who he is by now come
on give me something
but ezra i'm not i'm not doing another
one if something comes
to hollister you're switching back in
flint
or yeah gorilla the gorilla will be back
the problem with that is
i don't care how broken they are you're
just you're just switching them in i'm
not mad
i hate to have to be the one to tell you
this but it would need to be a
an updated one at least for flint
because
the one for flint is not accurate
anymore why not
no what it doesn't mention anything
about his peculiar condition
he doesn't have to he's in denial of his
we're in denial we're in denial get out
of my head tom
yes it is we've reached the dad joke
period speaking of the bad joke
period
uh so normally on this stream we do a gi
joe moment
in honor of our patron the baroness who
by the way
is the reason where'd it go
i had a coaster oh one of these guys
yeah the baroness is the reason that we
have these awesome coasters the aaron
has commissioned these
so thank you baroness but so in honor
of the baroness we had a gi joe moment
but you know last week i think in in
in discord dr paramecium mentioned
that
he was learning about 80s tv from our
show and so
i'm going to expand it we've done this a
little couple times where we've talked
about other shows
and i'm going to so kids the 80s were a
dark time there were like
seven channels if you didn't have cable
there were like seven channels on tv you
watched whatever was on
and so we watched some real crap
um and today i want to talk to you about
the crappiest of that crap
there was a television show in the 80s
called madam madam
was a puppet the puppeteer
waylon flowers had a
hand an old it was an old woman a rich
old woman
uh that would go wandering around in
here
and he was in the show as well but she
was not a puppet in the show
he was just always kind of standing by
her for no apparent it was
uh astounding to me that um
no madam was nothing like the duchess
madam was
uh madam was like google
wayland flowers madam it's weird the 80s
were
like i've seen there's a guy today who
does like
an old guy puppet but he's like
you know he sort of that's just a comedy
act this was
hey let's make a tv show about this
puppet and make it up
nobody's gonna we're gonna pretend like
it's not a puppet like madam was the
only puppet
in this show everybody else was people
and this show existed for
more than one season
it lasted for more than one episode and
that lasted for more than one episode
it was man yeah the 80s the 80s were
bad
so every now from now on every episode
i'm gonna tell you about one of the
awful shows
that i had to watch in the 80s next week
think spandex think sports
and think really bad you're gonna have
to narrow it down a lot oh yeah
so so so this is called 80s cringe back
is that what yeah
80s cringe back i like it again
the cringe hour no no
no so
um we're already called the great dane
society
[Laughter]
uh it was not american gladiators it was
not
yeah no this will make american
gladiators look like
shakespeare wow
okay now we got something to look
forward to there's like
yes it's it's terrible so um
so you yeah you he'll he'll take you
into his
uh tamagotoro wants to know if there's
gonna be an 80s edition of movie talk
um i already made the joke so they
watched dumb and dumber and
it was it was warren and uh
uh aaron and amy and thomas and then i
made a joke about the terrible 70s
swinging movie
bob and carol and ted and alice
uh which is bizarre
like that movie it's a first of all it's
a 70s movie
in the 70s elliot gould was a sex
symbol so that's already wrong
uh that's a good joke manga torah says
that 80s talk will be released only on
vhs
we're going beta baby if it's we're
going betamax
it's only gonna be i think it's coming
back
i had a friend man in high school my
best friend
uh was a laserdisc guy and laserdisc
guys
were like
they were like the early tech douches
because they were just like
you know you'd i'd be he'd come over and
i'd be like hey you know
i got the batman movie let's watch it
all let's watch you like oh vhs
i really only watch things on disc man
oh
we got a laser display when i was a kid
oh god laserdisc
you're in the middle of the movie to
stop the movie that's right yeah
every movie like a laserdisc could only
hold half a movie
so you had to flip it over halfway
through yeah it was a record
and but you know they were like laser
disc people in the 80s
and 90s early 90s were like that guy
today
who's like you know vinyl just sounds so
much better
i really hope bo and kelly aren't
uh so yeah laserdisc
the other thing about so my my best
friend in high school
didn't have a tv so when he came over
and spent the night at my house we would
play d d
all day saturday every week in in high
school
every saturday and um
once that was done he would spend the
night and
when because he didn't have a tv he
would watch
the worst crap like we'd just start
watching tv
and he'd be flipping around and he'd be
like hey pro wrestling or you know what
just like
any or what was oh god what was it there
was a usa
like um
hard r like sex thing
sirens or silk something i don't
remember but he
oh he loved that show oh god and he
would even try
so if you didn't if you didn't have the
channel
back in the day the porn channels would
be scrambled
and he would like be trying to see
something in the porn oh god it was
i was you know like he needed to get a
tv
all right we are i don't know we are
very far afield
uh oh thank you vindica sean
remembers the show silk stockings that
was it
wow that was terrible it was like a
awful um
it was like somebody said what if we
made a police procedural that was like
sexy
[Music]
okay so like every every
uh every crime was a was a like some
sort of
deviant sex crime and then the and then
the detectives would be like
well one of us is gonna have to go
undercover at this s m club
oh you broke tom well done it was like
it was like wow
well done it was it was this like
on saturday on usa they would do this
thing called
up all night and gilbert godfrey would
host it and they'd show
they'd show a bad movie and then they'd
show one of these shows
and like they'd cut interes interspersed
would be gilbert godfrey
usually with a scantily clad woman and
then i think later on a scantily clad
woman
just hosted but it was oh man
all right have i finished taking
agatha's temperature
something about agatha she is not well
so uh
uh clive will um
take you to back to his sort of
office
and and he'll say um
so what i've figured out is that we've
got to stop
to kill the black pharaoh there's
something about
that pyramid in doshur
and there's a ritual but it's only
alluded to
but there's some sort of ritual that
will seal
the that will seal that pyramid and
and banish the black pharaoh
and i'm just looking at everyone else at
this point
i'm just looking back just poker face
like hmm
interesting so are you willing to share
what you've you've learned so far
maybe we can help yeah yeah of course so
it's it's the it's the bin pyramid in
joshua okay or sorry the red pyramid
in da sure is the pyramid and we've got
a
um it says there can't be any
and it also suggests
that you need innocent blood
so it's some sort of sacrifice ritual or
something no
just needs the blood there there are
ways to get blood
enough blood without sacrificing people
doctors know how to do that or at least
to the point of
death pat my bag well i'm very glad to
hear that
uh i don't know how innocent my boys are
but they'd be willing to help
i always need people to purge evil
do you have any ideas about the
purging evil part
well that's part of the reason that i
got um
that i that i needed this the
necronomicon uh
yeah i do in fact have uh
it's a little bit cliche you know but um
the necronomicon is fairly instrumental
in summoning a number of unpleasant
things
and binding them and i'm thinking
if i can bind them then
we can use these unpleasant things to uh
cleanse the presence of evil because
when you bind something you can dispel
it
you can send it away it's it your beck
and call
so to speak assuming you can hold it
there we've been we've had we've seen a
couple instances where people summon
things they can't hold
will yeah okay sure i mean
it gets very interesting very quickly
and i mean that in the chinese curse
sense
i mean i've also got the advantage
[Music]
with the work i've done in this
time dilation rituals
i think i can use the time dilation
ritual to really
uh to concentrate the time
of the these rituals because some of
them take quite a great deal of time
yeah oh you can make the time pass
faster
uh yeah so uh
yeah i i can although
so time is tricky little little thing
isn't it uh
just because time is moving faster for
me
doesn't mean time is moving faster out
that makes sense that's true
so you know if the ritual says i have to
sing some sort of song for four hours
then yeah i can sing that song very
quickly
but if the ritual says you know this can
only happen at noon on thursday
then i have to wait till noon on
thursday
or the night or the night of the full
moon and if the ritual says you have to
do something until
like dawn then well you have to do it
till dawn then
but yeah just say there's
some we've got some unpleasant
characters of our own
who have driven away the other
unpleasant characters
dawn
i'm gonna just like look around at the
other three and just like raise an
eyebrow like
dude we put our cards on the table and
joan looks at you and i i give you the
i point at my backpack like this we have
the ritual
i know she can see the future
right did she tell you how this
conversation was going to go
well i mean so she sees broad swathes
really
it's not you know poor woman she's
not writing down every single word that
people say
i hope but you know i knew you'd be here
in order to get the ritual done it's
right
now the problem the challenge
no i'm going to say the problem the
problem is again
big blacks there's a big black pharaoh
sized hole in her abilities
so i have no idea if this is going to be
successful or not
which part's going to be successful the
summoning part or the ritual itself
well the ritual itself yeah
did has has she seen how the summoning
might go or at least tonight
it's still too far away that's true
right um
also i'm glad to see you have a doctor
here because
i think agatha might be dying um
look over at hollister she hasn't slept
in going on a month now oh yeah that'll
do it
i mean can we afford to i think i think
we cannot afford to have her die
before well yeah it would be much
better if she was functional
like the starting the two days leading
oh if if if we knock her out and let her
get some sleep
well here's the thing i'm unclear
what effect her not
[Music]
recording the future will have on her
psyche if she suddenly wakes up and has
four days of future like
backloaded there i don't know what's
gonna happen
oh so is there something we can do to to
strengthen her as she is
[Music]
well that's good to know that's good to
know yes
before i add anything to the mix
well i mean that was that was days ago
seemed to help
all right and and and meanwhile is there
anything else that you're missing
well so again i don't know a great deal
about that ritual itself it's something
about the pyramid i'm
i'm gap that's really where you come in
i think all right
i'll i'll look over at joan and be like
might as well show them
we have the capstone oh my so what's
that say
the eye of light and darkness huh
and so and that's
that's where the blood has to go then
see
i see well um
all right i think we could do this
so my
my role in this as i understand it is
going to be about a day before
to go to that pyramid and summon some
unfortunate things
and really kind of clear the area out
and and then dismiss them so that the
evil doesn't remain
it's right that's right well or you
could just move it outside of a
mile to make a perimeter right
ooh not about it i mean a mile and a
half out
depending on what i'm able to
bind you know um
it's a lot easier to clear things out up
to a mile than it is to then
expand out from that you know holding
the perimeter becomes a challenge i'd
still
i'd still rather okay
let's do i personally i'd rather do this
as quietly as possible
yeah yes um
would it be possible you you and agatha
moved around in space
as well as in time is that something
that you would be able to assist us with
because getting from
cairo to joshua without being seen would
be incredibly helpful particularly with
people
um to supply the necessary
things for the ritual so
you know you lot
you're all a little daft i'm
i'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crackers agatha's
probably already dead so people like us
going through spider portals and that
sort of thing
really not a problem if my boys here saw
a spider portal
well but your your boys are uh
are egyptian they can maybe travel a
little bit
less conspicuously than we can being
well
very white i mean i was just gonna get a
boat
we have to get a whole bunch of
volunteers there as well
that's true and getting them through a
portal would be nigh impossible
yeah and we're gonna have to go with
them
you don't hear any every day
which part of that getting a nun
through a portal um
you've got that book here the
from reviewing notes that that book is
some sort of a beacon of some sort that
like draws
are you planning to bring it with you
uh well i was going to leave it here
because from what i understand the
necronomicon is
so the only question is
if i bring the book my summoning
abilities
are greatly enhanced makes
sense
as long as i'll leave the book here yeah
as long as it's at least a mile away
from who knows
is the book evil yes yes
uh that's the real question is evil
something i am or something i
do understand well either
may we know that the book is evil i say
for us it's what we do for
well that's classical the ring yeah
that's that's whoa
oh well i think the black pharaoh is
kind of a classic other don't you
i think it's fear it's fear yeah
i mean like i said we wanted nida chris
to be our our portal to ancient egypt
metaphorically speaking only uh
for research purposes to have that
primary
would be nice but no no
no you you were right she is as evil
well there we go so what
it has to be the the the night of the
full moon
and it starts at moonrise and goes
and goes to moonsat our ritual
has to be cleared before that happens
yes
so clearing sort of the day bef the
the night before up to the afternoon
then you lot come in into the cleared
area
um so
if i study more i could probably
learn that spider portal thing that
agatha can do
because i'm not sure she's got much more
in her well can i
i do want to try getting her to rest for
at least a couple of hours
you're the doctor i i'm
i don't know what's gonna happen i mean
even if you don't catch her with
morphine just
stopping writing for a while might help
so she was fine in normal
up until about a month ago maybe a
little before that
uh when there was uh
you know we had our first encounter with
uh
the knight of chris situation uh
and we found out that's when we found
out
that they wanted to they wanted to
use us in agatha
as a conduit to bring knight a chris
bick
using some sort of belt
using some some some it was three
different items
um they couldn't find all the items at
that time
but they still did something to agatha
that kind of
heightened she before this you know
she was one of those oh there's a
spirit in the room oh it's your uncle
uh sort of things but after whatever
happened
she was she was driven she stopped
speaking she only
she just writes everything that's gonna
and if i tried i took the book away she
yeah she would probably should probably
wake up writing on the sheets and the
walls
yeah but then one of my sockets and
sleep somehow maybe the doctor can help
out that
yeah well and if she's made it a month
so far
maybe she'll make it another week but
i mean i'm not the i'm not the medical
person
well i mean by all means i would love to
eat look
i know not she doesn't eat at any
at all does she eat at all can you get
her anything in her no no
no she knows food yeah we got to get
something in here
i i had to inject her with the
cocaine
normally you know if i've been awake 24
36 years cocaine
[Music]
well if dr hollister can have a look at
her
i'll start gradually
sedating her i don't want him too rapid
and just seeing if i can watching how it
works if she's
reacting if she's calming down i'll i'll
give that a try
uh do i do i have something like do i
have an iv
actually no okay you have you have a
syringe you smudges yeah
is this something i push yes you'll get
if you push it you're getting yourself
an a a another uh
another inspection all right so
how am i pushing this though you're
you're digging deep into your medical
knowledge and trying to haul out all
those notes that you took
in med school
people who are driven and and
either way it's a moot point because i
roll the four yeah there you go
all right so yeah you um
you spend about an hour slowly
like giving her
small doses of sedative and she starts
to like nod
and and she's like she's fighting it but
finally
after about an hour she gently lays her
head down on the book
her hand stays perched but doesn't write
him
i know it's going to be futile but i am
trying to talk to her
through this not not being too
distracting but just softly talking to
she seems utterly non-responsive she
doesn't she's not like whispering or
talking or anything yeah i mean i don't
know if it helps but i'm just trying to
metaphorically yes can can we look at
the book
and see where she left off writing sure
um
so she left off writing let's see
i'm curious what do you want no no this
is perfect
you beat me to it that's what i was
looking at before
yeah afternoon of the 30th
okay i am gonna tell clive about the uh
by the way the egyptian military is
probably gonna attack here in about two
days
and that is what is yeah that is what
this story is about is
uh a it's she's writing about the
um the assault by
the egyptian authorities on the black
pharaoh's base
in the great pyramid did you get to the
part
to tell us how it goes no she just
finished with the destruction of the
sphinx
oh no
let's take some let's let's do some
rubbings before we leave
totally and
you i'm gonna i'll i guess i'll stay
here and i'll try and get back to the
base in the morning
but you should all uh
go talk to the general well
actually let's call it an education role
make me an education role
either way it's a not five odd five all
right
so as you look at the book and as you're
reading what's happening
it becomes clear to you that the first
letter of
each line is spelling
something if as you read it down
and as you read it down um
the first letter of each line on this
page
um
[Music]
uh is saying
oh
and then you flip another page and it
says the exact same thing
like somehow the construct of everything
she's writing
has that exact same thing where on every
page
if you read it down the first letter of
each sentence spells out i'm already
dead
i'm gonna like look at that and just
keep flipping pages
looking at all of it and then like reach
over and
um try to take her pulse oh yeah there's
nothing there
and i just look at dr hollister and just
run my finger down the page
showing him the what's written down the
side
yeah i wouldn't have wouldn't have
looked for that
what's happening alex she's already
loaded dead she coded it in the book and
my and might be dead
might have been dead i'll actually like
flip back to the beginning when all of
this started
more how what what is her
what is her temperature uh
she seems normally alive to you
no if we find a pulse
he finds the pulse but i don't that's
right
alex i mean
the pulse is super weak like she might
as well be dead
especially now as she's sedated yeah
i'll i'll like double check on the side
of her neck i know what it what
what a pulse feels like i've looked for
it as in my other job and i'm just like
it's not
there you can make a first aid roll if
you want
like when you when you put like moisture
in someone's mouth
uh could we do any sort of like a broth
or something to try and get some
nutrients in here
or i sure yeah i mean
it's yeah you you can try and get some
food in her with a first aid roll you
will find a very faint pulse
i mean you i can just take a rubber tube
if i need to when uh
yeah yeah you can i prefer not to so
it is it is now the evening
of saturday the 30th we're going to go
to the general
right we we're going to have to go
back to the vehicle is the vehicle even
going to be there
didn't we ask the vehicle to stay or you
asked him to stay yeah he might not be
we'll have to figure it out i gotta go
out at least all right i'm standing here
you could look in the book and see what
it said
joan do you want to stay as well in this
archaeological fund with all these
rubbings about the defeat of the black
fair and what happened in the past
perhaps
yeah you might want to this might be our
only chance to record this if you want
to
especially if it's going to be destroyed
in a couple days
are you guys all going to take off alex
and i will deal with the general
um the doctor will have this poor woman
out and you can
do some advanced library search that
sounds like a plan
that sounds like a plan and i made it
and i'll lean a link close enough so
that if clive's in the room he doesn't
hear
in as much as we can trust him there's
armed people here to keep you safe
and i think our goals align closely
enough that i trust him
about as far as throw him yeah yeah
i'm glad we showed him that way he has
some reason to keep us around
well and yeah i don't know he doesn't
seem duplicitous or maybe he's just so
good that he fools me
hard to say hard to say considering i
thought he was a ghost
wow
[Music]
well he seems to trust us based on
whatever it was written in that book so
i guess we don't kill him the next two
days at least
and we'll see what happens after that it
was six or seven days
yeah yeah wait we need to we need them
at least until
the morning of the seventh agreed all
right
i'll be here take care of yourselves
ready all right so with this
with the splitting of the party i think
we are going to go to break so
um it's we are giving away another set
of these coasters
so it is hashtag chaos at the break
uh to get these fabulous coasters
um a few rules you have to be in the
continental u.s
or canada except quebec uh
and you i think that's the only rule
actually
um you can't have won something sometime
i'll let the lawyers deal with that i
don't know what's good um
so hashtag chaos for your chance to win
these there there it is these lovely
laser etched
fine coasters that i use
every day we we will be back just as
soon as
five people can use five different
bathrooms
[Music]
welcome back the coasters have been
awarded to mango torah congratulations
you get your you get a set
of these courtesy of the baroness so
congratulations to mango torah
that and you know and you got your um
you got your uh
somebody pushing a roll so everything
you wanted
now we just need to fire the roll i i
would had to have messed up
i'll try to mess up more in the future
that would that would be much
appreciated
no you know what i'm gonna roll with the
bad guys i'm swapping them out
no please dude what i already
helped the old lady not die he's not old
funsies right she's not old for
funsies so
you several of so um
alexandria and donald head out and
um sure your car is still there the
guy's still there
um he is uh
he's he's been waiting he he
very much wants to be paid more we'll
pay
more and he will take you back into
town and you will
um you'll go to the restaurant he knows
where it is
um you are the only white people
probably within
you know several hundred feet of this
place
um and you go in a back room and
um there is a there are two soldiers
that let you through and then there is
uh a guy sitting there in um
in a military a military uniform
and he will stand up when you come in
and and
general pleasure to meet you general yes
um
enough of what you have said to him that
uh i wish to coordinate and any
information you have
about the army of the black pharaoh and
how we might defeat it if you have any
american intelligence or anything like
that we will certainly take it
although neither of you sound american
we aren't
but we do associate with a particular um
group from america
that in american intelligence
essentially
that operates in this area i i see
here unofficially obviously we have no
official rank or position
we're just intermediaries as it would be
but we will
whatever information we can gather for
you we'll bring to you about the
intelligence we can about them and
there's any equipment or other
needs needs you need whatever uh
supplies uh
well we are we're fairly well armed we
we managed
to repatriate a great deal of
armament from the
when we drove the english out the
armory
is is fairly well stocked um
we need men manpower this
this uprising
seems to have started overnight and
um and and spread across most of the
country
uh essentially we have control
we have warships we have well
we have ships cruising the nile
uh and their guns are enough to keep
most
but the rest of the country we have
functionally lost
what do you believe they're operating
out of their headquarters is for
instance
they're not centralized that's there's
there doesn't seem to be
uh there's not a central command
there's no command structure that we can
random groups of people that rose up
across the country
at the same time at the same time
they have no military structure
whatsoever
not that we have found they seem um
utterly disorganized uh
that's their fighting style and they're
quite it's quite effective they
what now prisoners have you captured
their prisoners interrogated them
you know the usual course not really
again this happened so quickly that most
of our
most of our our outposts that weren't
in cairo or along the nile were
overwhelmed
but you're you're planning to make a
push on giza
uh yes yes it's something of a
both a a public and private black eye
to have the greatest treasure
in all of egypt not in our hands
understood as far as armaments go
other than rifles what else do they
well we don't know
heavier weapons because we had
um we had armored cars
and that sort of thing in some towns and
they were dealt with no problem
we we we don't know how so we presume
they have some sort of anti-vehicle
weapons
i think we just lost joan briefly we did
unfortunately
uh so we'll keep going with this
scene but then when we get joan back
thomas will
slaughter right in yeah right and of
course we don't know who their
leadership is there's no one we can
negotiate with
obviously we have not been able to find
any any sort of terms or any
it's very mysterious interesting
i'll i'll lean it lean over to donald
and as quietly
does does that sound like something that
the things you saw at the
plantation could have done with the
armored vehicles
[Music]
hard part to say hard to say they moved
so fast
mostly attacking men though not really
attacking vehicles
but if it's something that can pop out
of the ground
right
[Music]
something more than weapons being used
sounds like more than weapons
uh you know religious fervor and whatnot
these people and their beliefs
more valuable sometimes in guns and
bullets
um we also
uh
you know there have been reports of uh
of them not taking prisoners that they
they tend to slaughter the men they
capture
almost ritually bad for morale
no sir i have now given you a great
deal of information
what information can you give me we'll
go back to our respective governments
and see what we can find out
do you need aerial maybe error
observations
a spy location whatever we can find
we'll bring to you that would be
yes aerial observation would be useful
about men if you really want men do you
but do you want western
soldiers operating in your theater
right they would not be english
we can inquire about that as well so men
intelligence information
if you're good on weapons fuel and
logistics
uh we'll get to we'll get to what we can
within 24 hours
all right just i i
was if apparently nigel has told you
about our
uh advance on the pyramids that is
due to begin
at sundown in two days
sundown sundown okay
understood we're hoping to catch them
unawares
um all right so you guys head out
yeah and and as we're walking i imagine
since since you mentioned the restaurant
is an old cairo i'm very specifically
a watching to make sure we don't get
knifed in the back very literally and
be watching for any cats okay make me
a luck roll
here kitty kitty can we both go luck or
just alexandria
well the only the people that are
looking for things all right
26 hard success so all right
sure yeah you see there i mean you now
that you're looking for it there are
cats all over
uh old cairo downtown cairo not so much
yeah i would have if there was any
food about in the in the restaurant i
would have palmed
a small amount to use as kitty bribe
sure yeah
so i'll like tap donald on on the
shoulder but hey watch out for me
and crouch down near it near one of
one of the cats and like hold out and
like toss a piece of food in its
direction
okay yeah the cat you know several cats
will come
jumping up and will chow down
and how do you know which one to fade
i don't they're all connected to her um
and i'll i'll i'll say i don't
uh make me intelligence
sure make me an intelligence role
[Music]
you ready to push it oh
uh you made it yes all right it
[Music]
is
and i'll i'll say quietly
could you tell neris that that we would
that like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] its head and then runs
off
yeah thank you now stand up brush my
knees off
and now we wait that's the best we can
do you're just gonna wait in old cairo
no gods no i i i imagine that the
message will get to her and she'll
she'll either find us well she'll break
into a military base
she'll find us when we're out and about
we don't spend much time in the military
base except to sleep there
is there some sort of safe cafe we could
hang out and have a late night i mean
for you guys
the safest places are in downtown cairo
let's go
have a late night drink all right
okay and i'm definitely like watching as
we go to make sure that no one's about
to jump off of and
jump off of a roof at us yeah you don't
see anything here all right so we cut
back to the inside of the sphinx
and you two are going through
there's there's there's six rooms
uh of which three
one two three four of them are currently
occupied by
uh clive and his crew the other two are
just sort of
you know one's like a makeshift kitchen
and one is like a storeroom and
uh you know as you you're you're sort of
running through
both of you make me pow rolls
yeah i made it all right um
so you know you're
you're focusing on the art on the walls
yes we're looking for things to rub
if there's something scratched in i can
make rubbings well it's all
hieroglyphs right yeah it's all it's all
i'm looking to see if anybody did any
carvings that's all it does not appear
there are any carvings here
it seems painted on and joan make me an
archaeology role
okay can i jump in on that yeah sure if
give me a boost i am nowhere near as oh
yeah i i rolled a 19 that's a hard
not quite all right so um
you it's all
painted on and the paint seems
recent it feels like this paint should
be more
faded if people have been living in here
for a while
and you know torches have been
going on in here and if they've been in
here a month
it feels like this paint should be more
faded and who knows
what was going on in here before then
all right can i try to read it
sure make me a hieroglyphics role yeah
but why would it oh
wow i fumbled it's a 98
okay why why why
oh no i already didn't make it yeah i'm
used i'm using those dice
all right all right
so nick do you do you have any
hieroglyphic skill
i i mean i have some a little bit of
archaeology skill
all right that i'm aware of
all right so you two are in different
rooms
um you're in the back two rooms that are
not peopled by anybody
and nick you're going along looking at
things
and and um
is that is that figure wearing
a pith helmet is it holding a crowbar
what is going on here and you
start to see you run this string
of story
if if i see that i'm actually calling
like right away if like crowbar and a
pith helmet
i'm like lean over and look in the other
room
i'm calling all right so you're right so
uh uh
you i'm studying it really just like
you look in the other room and you see
joan has turned around and you see
coming out of the
well actually wait jonah you're the one
who fumbled so you should get the
so so nick you hear
something from the other room the as
you're going for her and
because coming out of the wall now are
two very muscular arm oh my god no i
didn't make my sanity roll
what these dice all right they're
supposed to be good oh no these dice
these are looking bad
so at once
i'm in fight mode okay
so what happens is you look at these
hieroglyphics
and you see that same figure there's
like somebody with a pith helmet and a
crowbar
and in the story in the printing
whoever that person is gets pulled away
by some sort of horrible beast and is
disappeared and that's the end of the
story
and as you look at that the arms come
out of here and it sounds like we're
going into initiative
um so
let's see here all right you're in fight
mode so yes
um
okay so doctor you will be an
um what's your decks joan 65.
all right so this goes first make me
an opposed
i have a 50 which makes my strength but
all right this is a critical success
so the two arms come out
and just grab you and bam smash you into
the wall
um you take
five points of damage funk
yes i make it 40 out of 45. so you
are not
knocked silly not stupid but not
silly
uh and now it's your initiative
yeah okay those arms i'm going to try
to whack them i've
i've got my my trusty crowbar and
right i'm going to try to stab one of
those arms with the crowbar
and i'm rolling against crowbar
ugh no okay just miss i just miss all
right so you
you come down on the on the the arm at
six
and you it feels and sounds like you
it looks like skin to you but ah
yeah okay yeah all right so doctor
you'll be in on this one you will be
going last
um so another opposed strength roll here
all right good but not as good
okay yeah strength okay i got 35 still
good but not good is that a regular
success
yeah regular success okay one um
so it got a regular success as well so
uh it it has grabbed you but it hasn't
pulled you back into the wall
um and then it's you
ch ch so i try to hit it hit its arms so
you're gonna get a
um you're gonna have a penalty die here
because it's grabbed you
yeah i know okay didn't fumble but
uh got yeah so doctor you hear that
commotion you lean your head in
and there are arms coming out of the
wall that have grabbed joan so go ahead
and make me a sanity roll
courses are i'm switching my dice really
yeah i make the sand roll all right um
switching back to the other dice
you lose one sanity because arms
shouldn't be coming out of walls
uh and it's your initiative what are you
gonna do oh i'm screaming for clive
all right and i'll also run up and
try and
[Music]
i'm trying to like wrap myself and pull
on one of these
these are pretty huge arms right there
they seem
person slightly bigger than person size
bigger
okay if i can like if i can get a foot
wedge on one of the arms and wrap myself
around the other one and like
the whole way to try and all right uh
oh i actually made it
oh i mean just tell me
uh that's another oh i shouldn't that's
what keeps messing up my camera sorry
uh my gloating i have an ought
five
you know what you know what finally i
get a chance to push it i'm not going to
make it
and i'm probably going to fumble with
these but i'm pushing it
all right yeah you come in and like
you're you're just
bound and determined i said the worst
that's uh
in my head but i'm going to say it i put
my back into it there you go
okay it was it was worse but it wasn't a
fumble
huh
yeah all right so nothing bad happens
but you do not
uh you do not pull the arm off so it
still has a hold
on joan so we are back to it
professor you will see this joan will
not because joan is in
rage it looks like
um
for lack of a better word hieroglyphics
are like floating down the arms of this
thing
uh and so professor lam make me a power
roll
that's a pretty good role i just got pow
pow pow pow pow pow oh yes
that one's a hard success all right a
hard success so
the ink the hieroglyphics like kind of
flow down the arm and they seem to stop
uh when they get to the fingers of
this thing
i'm just too pissed off for them to be
able to get to
all right it's all you professor lamb go
go to town all right okay still have a
quantity die
oh okay until you can break this
thing's grip you'll have that penalty
guy
all right so what i'm going to do is i'm
going to try to actually shove it in it
i'm trying oh all right yeah i'll take
away the penalty guy for that you're
using a crowbar the way it's supposed to
be used
yes yes i'm not just trying to hit with
it i'm trying to crowbar with sure
that needs to be the title of the next
episode
this is for oh yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes i made it a regular success
all right yeah you have pried one of the
yeah you pry one of the arms off no
tried it i'm priding it off
uh doctor back to you
yeah i'm still screaming for clive and
i'm gonna try and
if i i'm holding onto the arm if i get
one my feet up
along the wall can i like does kicking
and
yeah just kicking at the hieroglyphs
like scuff them at all is that doing
can i mess with anything on the wall
interesting
oh yeah i make it um
sure yeah you like start to scuff some
of the hieroglyphics and
you see that the hieroglyphics from
the wall were kind of going into the arm
and so you've scuffed some of them and
it seems to have slowed that down
somewhat okay low into the arms and can
i still try and
pull on the arm at all to mess with it
um it was either you can either do the
scuffing okay i'm sticking with the
scuffing i'm just curious
but i've got a pry on it so how much how
much wiggle room do i have
uh you got a regular success yeah
uh you got you know you got a fair
amount i mean one of the arms still has
a hold of you
okay but i'm like got the other one
you you've been released from the grip
of the other arm okay
uh all right so now it will take a
penalty die
all right this is a pose strength so
you should make an opposed strength roll
i was trying to do that 99
yes 99 with a what these are supposed to
betrayed me let's see here
they're new they're new
um
all right so with the one arm the one
arm just once again yanks you
really hard against the wall yeah bam
yeah and you take four points of
damage
and and you are stunned for next
round
yeah all right um
uh professor you hear movement coming
from
so you hear movement okay yeah okay
yeah and i'm i'm still i'm still
trying to i guess i'm letting go of the
arm because that's been completely
fruitless and i'm just going up to the
the hierarchy on the wall just trying to
like smear them
as best i can okay yeah let's call that
[Music]
all right yeah you you are like this
paint seems
fresh and so you're like smearing things
no problem it's
um it's not a happy face to make it
[Laughter]
um all right uh
so next round they will be other guys
will be coming in
uh all right professor is out this round
so this is an unopposed role
55. all right make me a power roll
with a bonus dime with a bonus die okay
ought three all right so um
the the hieroglyphics start to flow
from the arm out of the wall into
you and
your forearms where there used to be
tattoos
acts as like a dam and stops the
hieroglyphics so the hieroglyphics
uh kind of make it to your wrist and
then
can't go any further they stop there
um but your fingers are covered in
hieroglyphics
right now and i'm still stunned i'm
just still kind of well this round
yeah
yeah so clive
and four of his guys will come in and
well there's something you don't see
every day
spirit spear the paint
um the guys come in with rifles
uh let's see
well they don't lose enough sanity to go
crazy but um
two of them leave two of them are just
like nope but two of them stick
around
and clive
um clive will go like
oh i've been wanting to try this and he
um all right
and so once again the hand
just grabs you and goes bam into the
wall
and apparently it's a padded wall now
you take one point of damage
yeah you take one point of damage joan
sorry um
as it bangs you into the wall again um
and as you
as you fall back you
um you feel yourself pulling
something out of the wall and coming out
of the wall
is whatever is attached to those arms
and it is something it's the the
the the cliched jackal head of anubis
coming out of the wall
um and a bare-chested man a very
muscular man
um wearing some sort of like a
skirt thing is
reaching out for you and we're going to
cut back to donald and alexandra
at that moment you
are you are
at a cafe in downtown cairo
and a cat
and like very pointedly like
looks starts to walk looks back
starts to walk there's our signal
and i'll i'll stand up and brush my
robes off i suppose
liver
all right so you you start to follow the
cat um
it leads you into a back alley
and standing in that back alley is the
priestess nerus
we have completed our business we have
um
i wanted to ask a favor that we would be
in my debt yes ma'am how would you
repay a debt to me i don't know
what is the boon you seek we
are seeking to trap
the the the black pharaoh back into the
we think that we have most of what is
necessary
for the ritual but we are having some
difficulty coming
and we would prefer to avoid human
sacrifice
full sacrifice anyway
[Music]
and you think i have a ready supply of
innocent blood i was hoping that
locking the the the black pharaoh away
was something that you would be
interested in doing
and perhaps could help us and if not
then i apologize for taking your time
i have one other request if that's other
request is unsuccessful
um if we can't get the blood perhaps
safe passage would be something that you
could arrange for us to help
us and our fellows make it there safely
where do you need to go
i see innocent blood
cats know nothing of innocent blood
we we hope to find some innocence but uh
how alive do they have to be
if for no other reason then because the
there well
but what can you give me for this help
lots of milk
i want as much milk as you can bring me
where do you want it you know where my
right alex
oh a bit there too
very well once i have the milk we will
discuss
to dashur how many will i be
traveling oh
there's the five of us and we will need
probably about 13 others
let's just say around just around 20.
around 20 is a good guess all right
how quickly do you need to be there we
need to be there
by well before moon rise on the sixth
very well return to my temple
and i will tell you where to go and i
will transport you
and give it give it give and give her a
pr a little bow
and step back out of the alleyway all
right
um so yeah that'll that'll uh
that'll happen and you know i think
at that point you guys head back to the
army base
yeah yeah all right is emma emma can you
deliver us those innocent souls that's
all arrests on emma in her oratory
skills oh
we're not willing donald darling we're
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
well i suppose at least it's nothing new
just another guy and now we cut back to
the interior of the sphinx
joan is like dangling sort of dazed
off of the arm one arm is still being
held up uh
hollister is like wiping madly on the
walls
uh and uh
clive is chanting something
uh and two guys that are left
are like looking at their rifles trying
to figure out if they should shoot
they they decide not to shoot but one of
them comes up and starts like
banging on this on this arm
with the butt of its of his rifle oh my
that's a good roll bird's a paradise
um he comes up and he like hits the arm
that isn't holding you and like that arm
like flops down for a second he like
knocks it down
uh he rolled a critical success with
ah well that one was easier to fall off
uh and it was on his side
sure all right
and um
[Music]
there's a sound in the room like
um so a there's a weird breeze in the
room
and both of you have your backs to it
unless you choose to turn around
um and there's a sound like a
um
there's a sound like a almost like a
uh like a port cullis like that
kind of sound and you hear clive go
and you hear an awful sound behind
you
well i know better um
all right that will bring us back to
the top of initiative
um this thing is now fully out of the
wall
and it is going to
um joan this is going to be its strength
versus your size because it's going to
throw you
at something okay so i roll size
you roll your size i have a regular
success
this is good we've already broken the
story in the hieroglyph where it pulls
you through
nope nope nope nope nope nope nope i did
not make it
all right so this thing just picks
you up
and hurls you make me a
eleven so yeah that's a hard ultimate
success all right so um
you have you have been flung
uh at one of those
ice there's like a huge one of those eye
spiders
an ice spider like that there we go
it looks like a nice crab or a lobster
maybe
this is and the eye spider
doesn't want to get hit by you
you like slam into this thing and
kind of staggers back a little i have my
crowbar so i hit it
yeah that's right yeah you bam into it
um you are now
that seeing that oh making a sand
roll
oh you're still in fight mode by the way
yeah terrible thing in front of you
so yeah don't make me a sand roll you
don't care i don't care
it all it all needs to die yes yes i'm
going to hack it i'm going to ha ha ha
ha all right that was that thing and so
next to you
dr hollister there is now a fully uh
removed uh
uh statue of something
uh that is moving and
it seems it seems well no sorry it's
about an
eight foot tall man except his head is a
black stone jackal head
huh but but is his body does he does he
look like it's all stone or does it look
like his body looks like he's human
other than the head okay
uh so we can work with he's gone
um clive is so surprised that his summon
worked
that he is gonna spend his turn exalting
this that's why you read the
necronomicon
um the two guys will make another sand
roll
um one of them just starts unloading his
rifle
into the awful spider it's just like ah
bam bam bam wow he's a terrible shot
uh so yeah he's just like shooting
things and
uh and the other one
is still by the the human and he's gonna
try and hit it again with his rifle but
less successful this time uh
you're next joan let's go see does it
still have a hold
of me does that the jackal the jackal
through me so i'm
i'm i'm over there you are now entangled
with an eye spider
oh okay i'm entangled with the spider
okay and so i'm gonna just try to crash
that because i'm fighting anything that
that evens near me i'm just gonna
that is true all right make a make a uh
oh yes that's a hard hard success
all right it does not make its dodge
okay
six oh wow
all right you whack it good what do you
do no that's helping
that's my hell what are you doing it it
threatened me
uh all right so you um
yeah that that happens a doctor
okay yeah if it's if it's got a body uh
i'm i'm basically
a point-blank range next to this right
it's true
can i just put the gun right up against
it's like
along the side of its chest and just
unload sure
yeah on the jackal are you on on the
jackal guy right yeah
and that's what's right in front of me
sure i mean not the guard
i don't want to shoot the guard no i was
thinking the spider who's next to me
so you'll get a bonus die on this roll
okay so that's canceled out by unloading
right
yes
oh hard success all right so that's
gonna be
max damage okay 10 damage all right
yeah
there is another cacophonous
boom in this room as you just
jam this thing up under its armpit and
blam and its left arm is blown off
all right and then the third shot oh
the third shot
i made a regular success is that good
uh that doesn't seem to do anything okay
uh but you you've blown one of its arms
off it does not seem to react by the way
uh um
oh man what is clive meaning
[Music]
don't you can't don't no that's helping
i'm just sort of surprised okay fine
oh no you are not fine no this is an
abomination in front of you
oh i know but i'm saying okay fine i'm
just saying okay fine i'm just saying it
i'm not don't worry don't worry don't
worry
um so all right the
the the statue is going
the the the anubis head is going to
uh just take a swipe at you dr hollister
so you should
make a dodge roll
cursed dice it doesn't matter because my
all right you take whoo
you take eight points of damage
whack all right that is a solid hit
uh is that more than half your hit
points
up give me a verbal sign where we lost
oh my god it knocked nick into latency
dr hollister's unconscious yeah
shoot i didn't think it was that bad wow
those are the noises that dr hollister i
can hear them
nick put in the chat if that is more
than half your damage
[Laughter]
i wonder if he got kicked all right no
he's still
he's just like his internet is all right
so dr hollister gets knocked out
bam and
um joan it's he well actually
spider first spider key
is he gonna run away no the spider is
looking after
oh hey well the spider is going to go
after
uh the statue because that's what it was
summoned to do ah there he goes all
right we lost nick he'll be back shortly
hopefully
uh it's stop watching netflix while
we're doing this people
it's not helping oh he's already back
although he's already frozen
[Laughter]
oh no all right so it's going to it's
going to take a swipe at the statue
and it's going to miss but this thing
has it's ours
i made a con roll right yeah did you
make it should make
did you make the con roll
nick use the chat dude
oh the drama all right so
uh until nick is back he's unconscious
um
so yeah i made a con roll all right he
made the conroll
okay so he got knocked up to the side
he will be back next round
he got knocked up this thing with the um
we heard that you made the con roll uh
out of five are you can you
yes we can hear you okay okay there you
are
all right so this thing is uh
slicing down with its knife arm and it
misses um
clive is gonna start chanting again all
right when do i get to whack something
it's all you all right wow
i am just gonna wildly swing at both of
those things and we'll see who i hit
geez louise all right who said that
these dice were good
birthday paradise love me they love you
they're loving
me mine go great i you need to smudge
yours smudge them properly i'm going to
smudge them i'm going to smudge them i
just got them
so be here all right so
you like step into it and you wind up
and you just crash the um
the the the curved part of your crowbar
right through the eye of the eye spider
and it just shatters like glass
and as it shatters the the pieces
that it shatters into are just
disappearing
hollister hollister like
even as he's chanting as you smash that
thing
he like goes ugh that hurt
you mean clive clyde sorry five no i'm
like i've got it ollie i got it
yeah all right i'm celebrating
hollister we're back to you
uh i'm i'm backing up i i have to get
some like this is just getting
wasn't that he said that was i'm
going to the other room
i can't breathe i think my ribs are
broken
i'm going to just you got this you got
this i
you got this you start to head back uh
past
uh the one remain that so one guy has
just been shooting wildly and now he's
just like click
click click the other guy has been
kind of effective but you make it
through the door you hear clive
chanting in some language you don't uh
know
um and uh
and i lay down on the floor i yeah you
can't get in the other
nice all right uh
the statue like turns
and it will start to go towards
uh actually you're right there so it'll
take a swing at you
uh you should make a dodge roll
uh professor hall oh what
about the lamb i should say sorry it got
in the same room as me
there's another one okay dodge roll
yeah i got a zero seven what oh wow all
right so this thing this one armed
oh yeah perfect man perfect it's like
tries to backhand you and you
slide right out of the way no problem
uh clive finishes his chanting and he
says might be something a little more
direct
and he like
around the one remaining arm like
it starts to like wither in front of you
and just like the one arm and
so all of a sudden it's like this this
old man arm with very little musculature
all right it's to you lamb
me again yeah all right all right i'm
gonna
i'm just gonna smack that arm because it
looks like right
all right
and yes yes yes i hit it not
it i did it i hit it i hit it okay 61.
uh
so wow it gets a critical success on its
dodge roll
so it slides out of the way um
and clive starts chanting again
uh the guy with him does nothing uh
we're back to the top
this thing starts oh you sorry yeah
hollister
i'm i'm putting some bullets i'm putting
three more bullets reloading
yeah and i'm asking is did did you
get it is it is it dead
i tried to summon something to help and
your friend
killed it well yeah she she can be
hot-headed
you know how hard it is to convince
something else to come here after the
first one got killed
uh i'll oh i'll i'll slunch up and start
gradually moving my way back towards the
door but i'm not gonna
i'm in no hurry all right pardon me
i've got a chant and he goes back to
chanting
uh the the statue thing
makes a um
for lack of a better term it makes a
barking noise
but it's this deep gravelly barking
noise
uh and the the head does not move at all
oh we've got it it's ah we got it
um and it just that's what it's doing uh
back to you professor lam all right i'm
gonna smack its head
that's it i'm smacking it i'm smacking
oh yeah that's that's a that's an
extreme that's an extreme success
that is double damage 10 10 10. double
damage
all right double damage so i roll once
and double it right
uh no you roll both dice oh okay so you
roll the dice twice
right in the head right in the head that
you didn't of your crowbar
down on the head of this thing and there
is like a cracking
sound and it
um it swoons
and like when it swoons it just
falls back into the wall but so now
there's just a pair of
about from about the right above the
knee there's two legs just sticking out
and make me a
okay
25 i make it all right you there's a
brief
second where you spin around looking for
something else to hit
uh and you are ready to keep fighting
but then you like
come to your senses when you see like um
clive is like chanting but looking at
you a little worried and there
the two soldiers are like backing away
from you where's holly
and i'm i guess i'm i'm slowly coming
around the door at this point he like
slides around with the gun out
yeah okay all right
what what do we do do we push it in do
we pull it out
it disrupt the hieroglyphs
so they they're making some sort of do i
still have them on my hands
no okay because that would freak me out
too
the the paint's fresh so the wall
is now very different the paint doesn't
seem fresh it is not
us there's no figures with crowbars and
pith helmets
what i'm gone i'm not on the pyramid
anymore alas
okay how long does it take me to calm
down from this because i'm i'm pretty
amped for a while yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah i'm raring to go try it's
just smart smacking out
i'm gonna try to smack it as his feet
you're going to stop me holly
i'm going in the other i'm going to my
medical bag and i'm
you want to do this you cannot date on
yourself
i believe i believe in you all right
yeah you you
just got it whacking away at these
very flesh-like legs yes i don't want it
to come back and
and do anything not moving
we actually got to the point where where
there's pushing yet
because this is i'd like to be able to
breathe tomorrow
you can push it as well or you can use
inspiration your choice
you could push we have we have eight
inspo you have we have a bunch
but i haven't actually have we
successfully pushed yet yeah yeah you
did you did it
no no no because i got the role in the
first try each time so i never got to
the point
no no you pushed you said push you have
used the push yes
use the opposition for the love of gods
inspiration and i'll use the good
dice is that what you want yes that is
exactly what i want
yeah you obviously thank you holly roll
by sapphire
i still didn't make it all right um
did you roll worse no i rolled slightly
better
all right i need something for that
a name for that so
so you two are gonna are you going back
to the base are you going back to the
sphinx
alexander and donnell the base i think
okay yeah the face that it's it's too
late at night to travel out to the
all about the base at four now the days
uh all right so you two are not sure how
you feel about spending the night
the the other two yeah professor lam
and dr hollister it is by this point
it's almost midnight i mean we've got
guards
if we're not going off into rooms by
i don't get i just i'm going to sleep
now
how do i get this rib to pop back out
[Laughter]
i've tried everything i guess i'm just
i could use my crowbar
i mean i guess they don't have ice out
yeah i mean i'm not i'm i'm not feeling
like a hike
so like where am i gonna go no we're
staying here
they know where we are all right
just ask clive to tell the guards to set
up
shifts and be more vigilant for fresh
paint i mean
i don't know how you're more vigilant
for things coming out of the wall
we should smudge all the french paint
that's it we need to smudge all the
fresh paint
the paint the paint on the wall was
fresh so if we're just keeping an
eye out we were looking at the
hieroglyphs painted on the walls but
they
the paint was wrong and then it showed
it showed professor lamb
and the arms coming out of the wall i've
read the necronomicon i know a thing or
instability and i'll tell you right
now
none of the paint in this place is fresh
well no what i'm saying was that the
paint on the walls when it happened was
fresh
something put that there so if the
guards are checking the walls for fresh
paint
that will alert us so i should tell my
men
to go around and just clean the walls
all night no no just check them just
just look just look with your flashlight
and see
fresh paint then that's a sign that
we're in danger
so they're not archaeologists
can't they tell if they shine on it it
glints it's fresh
sure yeah i'll tell him that um
how do you say paint in arabic i can
tell him
that i get all right yeah you you you
you successfully show him up
uh and so he'll yeah he'll tell them in
um he
uh all right
he when when things have calmed down
he
uh he sits down at a desk with a book
probably the necronomicon and he like
moves his fingers in a certain way and
all of a sudden he's
he's like flipping pages super fast ah
he's doing the thing
can i do first aid on myself because i
am way down on hit points
sure okay and here actually maybe i
should try to
do first aid on you and you you first
date on me
yeah okay all right i'll use my rule for
you
did you get it yes all right
so um
regular success did you
fumble me no i'm just so
close and i'm not going to spend luck
i'm sorry can i go
out inspiration re-roll it you got
inspiration
i am not great at first state medicine
is one thing
but first aid if you can get here
all right so you each get three hit
points back
awesome thank you that will help because
i was way down
um so there are cots and things like
that yeah
yeah both of you make me a luck roll
wow that's an eight oh 22. all right
yeah
you find you find the cots are not in
the room with agatha or clive so you've
got a nice quiet room
yes i'll tolerate you in my room holly
uh and yeah you
crash you you get to something few
people have done you sleep
god well about nine other people feed us
to it but you know
don't care none of my comrades have done
this so
there you go it's selfie you know how
many people in total
got it yeah yeah we're the first of ten
right so you're saying i'm not your
comrade
no no no no no i'm talking about those
people back
at the college yeah i haven't been there
yeah yeah um
the next day uh
um dr hollister you noticed that agatha
is still asleep she still has
the same very faint pulse
i mean yeah well if she's been awake for
about a month that's not a huge surprise
also she's incredibly malnourished
and highly no no no no she isn't
highly sedated
well all right she was multiply lightly
sedated yeah
like it like throughout the night but
i'm not too surprised that she's not
awake
uh but i am going to start watching her
and see if i can get any should we wake
her up
like let her let her like for now this
isn't
her her body is been through a lot of
stress it's not
it's not terribly surprising that she
would sleep in
i'm just gonna see if i can get any uh
like yeah maybe if i can get a small
tube or something get
a little something into her stomach all
right
um
she will yeah you can yes she'll take
down a little food sure
um so donald alexandra
you wake up in in in your hotel room
uh are you heading to the sphinx what
are you doing
i think first thing we need to do is
basically get into touch with rogers oh
wait sorry you're at the military base
and and it should be relatively easy to
get a hold of rogers from the base
they would they can send a cable okay so
we need to
essentially inform him that we we're
going to need u.s
military assistance to deal with the
army of the black pharaoh and cairo
we also need their help whatever
intelligence or other information they
have about
the enemy helping the give out to our
new allies which is
the provisional egyptian government
this operation at least
yeah anything that that they have from
from across egypt
to help us figure out if there's other
pla if there if there are
nexuses where the black pharaoh operates
out of that would be really useful to
know
okay
give me some social skill persuade
intimidate something um
using the tr referring to the
provisional egyptian
uh government as an ally is dangerous
language
for them so i'm gonna need a
i'm gonna need some sort of diplomacy
role here
got it all right what have you got
i've got intimidate that's been the best
i've got for you okay i will try
my persuade because i think that's my
very different telegram
i think that might be the best of our
social skills and i'm a little afraid of
that
i'll let you do the social talking right
yeah
as it may be i'm not
great at it holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i heard success
check that points i'll check that
freaking box
uh so yeah you you send off your
cable and
you you manage to artfully
refer to working with the egyptian
government without you know making it
sound like you're setting up an
alliance with them or anything like that
sure um
you know the the the your your liaison
at the base a lieutenant once again
when you send the message he's like you
know
i'm still not really sure uh
what your role in all of this is i i
understand that we're
we're supposed to give you a assistance
up to
you know up to a point that maintains
our neutrality
i mean that
that cable you just sent makes it sound
sorry afraid our roles are a bit
confidential
i see just communicate with our
commanding officer
well i i understand that i mean um
i mean just just so you're clear
uh you know i know the contents of that
cable you just sent
well you're us military you're not a
yes and and so apparently do you
i i feel like i've been fairly candid
i i see all right
from from what i understand your your
goal is to not be
seen as coming in into the war
the eye then what we are looking for is
something that's a little more below the
surface
information something that can't be
traced back necessarily
the two of us obviously are not american
operatives
right no but we work with the americans
all right we're deniable
you just send a cable to the the oss
of using us military of course this is
all all this here is
within the europe government apparatus
fella
as far as the world knows none of this
oh i see externally sure
sure yeah plausible deniability okay
yeah
these are people on this base and i i
care deeply
about the people on this base and i
don't
want them to be put in a position that
puts them in danger they don't need to
be in
don't have to tell your friend the
soldiers just like we are this is the
gentleman
our goal is is to try to keep them out
of danger as much as possible as well
it is better unless our ceo says
otherwise
the velvet glove is not doing a good job
of disguising the iron fist
here
no we're just the messengers fellow we
don't make the decisions
and yet in the cable you are suggesting
what
they should do that's right
we're we're the operatives in the field
and
um well they certainly do not listen to
us
in everything that we suggest they do
well you know i'll i'll do whatever
washington tells me to do but
do you really want to start do you
wars
always another warfare there's always
another conflict
surrounding us right now there's another
conflict going on
not if we don't get involved uh
laughingly regardless but uh
we may have a role in choosing the
winner which is about something that
all right well like i said if i can
you know
i any assistance i can offer you
i'm happy to do so but again i i want
you to
because i think about my people a lot
and i think about how to keep my people
alive
i care about people here and
i mean this in the nicest possible way
hi astrid
uh i don't think you care
if we if we can only tell you what this
maybe one day fella but suffice it to
say
the short version we care about people
we're doing this because we do if we
didn't we wouldn't bother getting
involved
do you believe that to the to the core
of my being
well there you are like i said
however i can assist you should we ask
and that actually does surprise
uh you know possibly
um yes if you are
willing to offer as assistance we don't
know much about supply chains
in this country if you would know of
somewhere where we can get
a large quantity of milk we have a debt
that's what they asked for i don't ask
i i mean any milk i could give you
would would be u.s military
you know it would be traceable who who
who would we be giving you it's not
important it's uh
we owe a debt to some intelligence
operatives we'll put it that way and we
need to give this an actual
email you owe a debt to intelligence
operatives that they want paid in
yep
and that will not be the weirdest thing
like i said any you know you have seen
the milk that we get is in cans that has
no gentlemen
my my question is is simply do you have
a local
connection and if not no worries we'll
we we try to be as self-sustaining as
possible
without using especially
most of the embassy staff are now on
this base
and we're trying to uh
we're trying to have everything we we
need here we get regular supplies
uh from from europe
it's all right good so how much milk can
who am i giving milk that says united
states military all over it too
well and i don't know if she would want
canned milk
obviously
all right prior prior to the lockdown
did you
did you have connections locally to
shepherds
goat herders anyone around here who who
might have a
local fresh supply i can ask
uh i can ask our logistics uh
i'm i'm sure they had you know
stores that they got them from
um it turns out that our boys don't much
care for camel milk which is most of the
milk you can get here
uh so i believe most of our milk was
still being brought in
sounds good put us in touch we'll take
care of it
all right yeah he'll he'll go through
his uh
his uh
gosh what do they call them logistics uh
and
there's a word for the guy who handles
logistics in the military and i'm
blanking on it uh
all i'm thinking of is steward on the
boat uh
so you quartermaster
yeah yeah that's it quartermaster that's
it exactly
um so yeah the quartermaster will tell
you the name of
they would work with a dairy
cool so he'll put you in touch with them
uh we need to get some funds too
yeah there's that
the look on nick's face the look on
nick's
face the piggy i mean i have a credit
writing
in theory i'd be able to get money but
you know
[Music]
let's see here so
my yeah he'll put you in touch
with a dairy but
what you'll find is that cow milk is
super rare
not i'm honestly not worried about cow
milk because it's neris which means
she's local
which means it would be like a goat and
milk goat milk is probably the easiest
to get yeah
milk is a little harder yeah i mean well
and goat milk will be super prevalent
because they can eat freaking anything
they're great
they're great desert animals yes and
so the dairy
is mostly goat milk
and and i cannot imagine that nearest
would have a problem with that because
she's
local and feeding local cats that's what
they would be used to
so the real challenge for you is
transportation
we asked them to deliver it on a truck
and then we just asked them to deliver
it to a location
um see if there's anywhere that if
the army would let us borrow a truck or
if there's something that that we could
rent
i mean how much how how much milk do you
need
how much how how much can you provide
over the next
fresh as fresh as we can get it
we could you know we could deliver
easily i would say
[Music]
a dozen dozen bottles and each bottle is
about a liter
mostly yeah that 144 liters
yes i just mapped that and oh my
goodness
a gross gross of leaders
the the truck
will have ice in it but it's not gonna
the milk won't keep very long unless you
keep it
in ice well that's not
our problem is that we just deliver so
as soon as we get it we need to deliver
it to our location
and where is it going we've got an
address
we i i since i don't want to lead anyone
to
naris's temple necessarily i want i'm
going to see
if there's anywhere that we can get a
truck or
any way to that we can transport it and
then i'll get it to them so the problem
with transporting it
is you know this dairy is you know
probably an
hour from the dairy into
old cairo if you can even get a truck
into old cairo
and so you need an ice you need a truck
with ice in it
yeah well if we can get them to deliver
from
the dairy into uh
downtown cairo like around the hotels or
something and meet them there with a
truck that should only be about 20
minutes from there
like a loading dock in the back of a
hotel and we just go from truck to truck
and then we go
location yeah that's my thought okay and
well i guess the usually you bill the uh
the the delivery fellow right dessert
well yes if if the restaurant has an
account with us we certainly build them
does the us government military base
have an account with you
uh they did until recently are you
you don't well let's see he
you don't sound american i mean to be
fair alexandria also doesn't sound
english
but to be fair donald's ass saying
everything yeah
okay well we can give some cash to you
that's a better solution to this
um when well you bring me the money i
will bring you your milk
on delivery will it make the exchange
right there in the loading dock
no no you bring me the money i'll bring
fine fine we'll we'll take care of that
good
all right excellent but but at least we
got that part set up and
i'm trying to because i would have money
like
i i i'm not a penniless person floating
about in the world
but you don't have what so like credit
rating
is for things like i can find stuff and
buy it no problem
large chunks of money is a different
issue this is
here
so this is gonna this is probably gonna
be
in 1920 money you don't have that on
your person
yeah that's true you can you know like
so
you can make a credit rating roll to go
to the bank
and write a letter essentially you who
write a
check against your account
i mean i would i i would i would like to
do that because i
i have a decent credit rating while
she's doing that i'll i'll contact
rogers again and say we need the
700 wired to us immediately for use of
purchasing
we'll see what happens first okay ought
for
opt for very nice all right so your
credit rating will go down by three
and you have all the cash you need cool
uh and yeah they'll bring a truck to the
hotel
and we'll meet up with with our own
truck we'll meet them there we'll do a
quick transfer and drive it down there
as fast as possible
all right we cut back to the sphinx
we spent all day doing milk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
so i i just want to throw in i'm
assuming but i'm gonna say it now just
in case it's not gonna be retroactive
that i'm i'm definitely keeping track of
her pulse
and you know her temperature and seeing
if anything is dropping or if things are
getting nothing is changing it's almost
like
um her condition is like
stable is the wrong word it's just the
same
static yeah static there we go
okay and yeah i'm not going to give
anything to
wake her up okay until the morning baby
she shows no no it is the morning i'm
not joking i'm not doing anything to her
system to jolt her awake
can we try to see if she'll wake up
though
uh do you could hurt her do you want to
hurt her
no but it might hurt her to stay asleep
it might be good for her to stay asleep
she's been awake for a month
but you don't know what the the
psychotic
part of this is you don't have a clue
about that
and you do i'm just saying that we need
her
yeah we need her several days from now
if she's already
dead does it matter
[Laughter]
yes
yes and that's the end of this
medical doctors think they're the only
kind of doctor yes
i say that just i know it gets under
[Music]
holly so are you just hanging out at
the sphinx
all day yeah
i'm still i'm looking at the hieroglyphs
and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they are they are normal again
right
yes they are very yeah and i will
happily take the time to record
normal hieroglyphs all right yeah and
and professor lam is
is you know she is all over it she is
like recording all sorts of stuff taking
notes that sort of thing
it seems like clive is is asleep
and as soon as he wakes up he goes back
necronomicon
i will jeez i'm going to write like a
slip of paper because i
because that time like don't forget to
eat and drink and i'll put that on the
end of a stick and slide it inside the
bubble clive will come out of the bubble
and be like oh no don't worry about that
doc i'm uh
i'm not gonna i don't want to end up
like old egg thing there
you don't have any cocaine do you big
do i have anything cocaine like i'm
pretty sure i have some sort of yeah you
have some stimulants at least
yeah stimulants give them stimulants
like i'll give like mild
dose yeah like a little like basically
kind of like no-dose sort of level but
you know keep your blood sugar up
yeah yeah and i'll say that's yeah
you're that kind of doctor too huh
no this is completely uh-huh
now i haven't given him cocaine this
isn't cocaine it's not like cocaine
god i wish she cannot help but poke
people with sticks can shane
um and he'll go back in his time bubble
um but he yeah
it's clear that clive is sleeping and
eating and like
taking care of himself to the extent one
can when one is accelerating time
yeah that's my worry do either of you
oh you know joan you have cthulhu mythos
you can make this lulu mitha's role
oh you you you get to do that yes sounds
nah don't megan all right um
so you know that like
all the every ritual you've done has
cost you
sanity and like clive is just throwing
this stuff around like nobody's business
yeah so i i mean is there i think i'll
i'll ask
dr hollister and tell him that next time
you talk to him
you might want to see if you can
psychoanalyze him because this stuff
doesn't
it makes you go insane as you might have
noticed
i try to do the most tactful like you
know whatever do you mean
[Laughter]
and i'm gonna wander off and get some
food and i'm not bringing back any for
you
um yeah the the guardsmen are like you
know they'll like talk to you in arabic
a little
and they're like kind of you know
they're like asking how things are out
there because they haven't been out of
here
yeah no not not you know i'll tell them
it's it's just nasty out there there's
so many different things going on the
different fights and
who's staying out of it and who's coming
into it and
we were hoping that this would help
[Music]
so thank you for hanging out with us and
making sure things are
are not going to come and get us nice
yeah they they they will like
think they like that that
conversation sweet
uh so you guys that help my sanity at
all
no that girl is always open
that might be the episode title
oh wow
awesome
oh wow
so so yeah you guys will spend
unless i hear otherwise you're going to
spend the whole day at the sphinx
like studying hieroglyphs yes that's the
only way i'm not going to lose more
sanity
or hurt somebody like were they were
they supposed to be back by now
they're coming back right they're coming
back they said they were coming back but
they said they were going to try to get
some stuff for us so
little do you know they're cornering the
dairy market
long as they're alive which you've
also seen no proof of
right but yeah if i if i do get a chance
i will try to
uh have a certain are either of you
you've looked at it a little bit i i i
think since he's looked at it a little
bit i'm gonna have to because
i have to i have to right yeah so yeah
i'm gonna try and
see if i can talk to if nothing else
for the academics of knowing just what
damage has been done to
clive's mind okay it is now
the morning of sunday may 31st emma
is giving a rousing speech we cut to a
montage of emma
giving a rousing speech talking about um
the importance of blood in catholic
ritual
and and how rare
and wonderful it is for people to have a
chance
to make a difference and to
end to end
the the the tyranny facing
uh facing egypt and she is
she's giving a full-on speech and the
people seem receptive um
the priest gave her a very warm
introduction and
um that that really helped um
alexander and donnell you
uh alexandra has taken a large amount of
money out of the bank
and you go back to the dairy and you pay
the man
uh he he assures you he's not a criminal
so pay him half now and half upon
and he says it'll take about it'll take
them a little bit to
uh get the truck loaded he offers if you
want you can
sure well it's fine
fine all right so yeah
it will all go off without a hitch
you'll you'll take the thing
so you now there's a very confused
private with a truck full of milk
um uh
um where am i taking this
just just follow my directions i've got
this yeah
yeah well the private in the truck is
driving down
so you're driving a u.s military truck
into old
cairo i was hoping we could get a
different truck i really was i was
hoping we could like rent something
what other kind of truck does the us
military have i was hoping for like
something we could rent in cairo or
something because i wanted to meet them
in like downtown cairo and meet them
with a rented truck there
um so donald said he asked the base for
it
it's fun let's do it oh
on your head be it so regardless of the
truck you pick
like old cairo is tiny narrow streets
it's you know foot traffic it is
you know goats and who knows what
else
in in the roads it's not a place you
bring a truck
um and so one of you make me a
navigation roll
good boy i have 15 to navigate how about
you
i've got 10 so yeah i got the bass you
yeah i got no idea you thought too wow
all right like my metal dies i know
thomas hates under the scourge of the
industry but i really like my metal dice
um so yeah you're giving pretty good
directions um
and you so you recall the temple of
bast was essentially a
sewer i remember yeah
[Music]
and so i'm basically looking for it for
that opening to it to the sewer to like
all right one cat will come out but the
cat keeps looking at the truck nervously
yeah i know we're we're gonna get them
to unload
and then they'll they'll go away
but it's so you just start unloading
right here is this the location this is
this is the spot
all right private let's unload
uh okay nap to it let's go
so he'll start just like putting uh
crates of milk on the floor um
yeah i'm helping like haul things out
while watching for
other cats to come and i
at least at least watch the show because
cats that one
cat is just watching very nervously and
keeps looking at the truck
oh i failed success
okay so alexandra you can make a spot
hidden roll
okay
oh that's a 16 which is just shy of a
critical success
all right so you see
before before they manage to jump the
private
you see like four gang members
cool they don't seem like you know
but they're they're basically like you
know they've got a knife and they're
like
they're trying to they're they're they
want to steal whatever is in this
you know whatever yeah i i'm gonna draw
two but two daggers and cut and come
toward them
and just be like go away so when i see
alexander draw i'm also
pulling my pistol out as well all right
they start saying things in arabic
and too white for that
and they they have grabbed the private
and they are barking at you in arabic
and the private's just like
i wanna private i'll just commercially
get down
get down this just like they they
they are holding him with a knife he's
not lean
lean down lean into the knife man people
don't do that
give them the milk let me go let they
could have the truck
i'm gonna like shift slightly to the
side and see if i can get a line of
sight to it to throw one of my daggers
at the guy who's holding the private
let's see what we'll call it let's call
that a luck roll okay no wait a minute
you're a professional
i'll give me a knife roll that'll help
oh yeah critical success sure yeah you
think you can get
a you know you can get a a throw um
you're not now
your your knives are not the you know
like take a guy out immediately sort of
things
no well they're they're they're uh
stiletto daggers so they're they're
they're
shaped like a triangle so they can they
make a pretty nasty wound that is very
hard to close up
it's true but they're not like you know
they're not like
i just hit you with a dagger now you're
not going to stab the guy you're holding
no but but it would be a very you're
dealing with with professionals drop the
guy walk away and we and we say no more
that's that's an interesting message
i don't speak arabic always always speak
in this context is knife
i don't speak arabic we just drove a
truck into the middle of old cairo
these guys are just armed with knives
right that's all you see
um there are i've got a gun i want to
try to use my gun to intimidate them
and try to make them back off make an
intimidate role
at 24 which would be a hard success
all right so you are struck with a hard
success
um you you like
um
so you see the that the guy
who is sort of looks like the leader you
you can identify who the leader is
um he is definitely like
nervous and panicking and sweaty but he
is like
um he is not he's not he's not more
intimidated like this is
turned into more than he wanted but now
he has
you know he's he's pushed his
chips into the pot and he is he's
committed
and at least for now you speak
english
any of you they're they're all just
barking in arabic which one of you gets
shot first the leader
the other leader right that's the one
let the fella go
do they even they're yeah they're just
like
you're just like very calmly talking
while you're pointing the gun
and they're just like they're just like
uh they're they're they're getting more
and more amped up
and they are they're pointing at the
truck
you don't get the milk you don't get the
fella either you get the bullets
or you get the hell out of here
is the cat still nearby the cat is in
the sewer
i'm gonna like crouch down and say if
you want the milk
help us
you hear over the wind a voice saying
you're i'm doing i'm already doing you a
favor
this is your payment i don't collect
your payment
i don't want to have to kill someone
um so they are not interested in the
there's only four of them alex we could
take these photos up pretty easily
very hello the
private there might get a little bit of
a cut though
i'm a bit worried about that and it's uh
i'm gonna make a sand roll for the
private it's not
this conversation that's a that that's a
pretty sharp knife he's got going on
there
let's stitch him up afterwards um
he fails his sand roll pretty
i'm gonna go one two fight
three four flight five six freeze
all right he will
try and elbow the guy who's holding him
good man
yes well um
now we know why he's a driver can we
inspire
can we inspire that guy yeah if you want
to inspire that sure i'll accept let's
well it's not an emma so
he like goes to elbow the guy and
the poor guy more out of reflex than
anything else just like
slits his throat okay then we're firing
yeah i
i'm i'm as soon as i see his hands start
to move i'm moving forward to like grab
the private and stab the person who was
who was holding him
i guess sorry i got ready to fight
hold on hold on there's no way that you
were close enough no
i was not that close that that would
have already started this fight
um so we'll go to initial well
we'll go to initiatives but you both
have for this round you both have
extra 20 to your initiatives
right firearm i imagine would probably
give him a bonus on decks
oh you oh yeah you but you've got a
ready firearm so that's actually 50
more here yeah so uh
and so yeah
i think that's going to make you go
shoot the leader
okay make me so a gunshot rings out
through old cairo
yep 54 is a regular success
all right roll your damage all right and
that is nine
plus two okay so you like
shoot this guy full-on in the leg
and he falls down and he starts crawling
away
uh like yeah he'll start crawling away
um alexandra you are next probably
all right
i i'm gonna run up to the person who is
is he still holding the private like
up oh no he drop like he is
this guy is as surprised as you are this
might be the first person he's ever
killed
well it's probably gonna be his last and
i'm gonna run up on
on this guy and just stab him okay make
a knife roll
uh 16 out of 97 is a critical success
all right you got this guy
you just run up and you just like stab
him
and he goes he goes down he's like
lying on the ground with his
holding his intestines in as you have
just
sliced most of him out and he's
screaming
uh the other two will disappear unless
you
wish to nope i'm fine with that
uh where's the leader the leader is
crawling away
i think i'll go put a bolt in him before
he gets away so you're gonna just go
kill him
yeah go up yeah right in the back all
right yeah that is easy to do
uh well while he's doing that i'm gonna
i'm gonna go to the private and see if
you know maybe maybe it's a flush room
maybe it was a nick maybe it was
oh no he's quite dead damn it he's quite
dead
damn it okay
are there two still visible that we're
running away so
uh so there are starting to be a lot of
people in the street
yeah there's a lot of like
chanting in all arabic
did we drive this truck or we leave it
behind we gotta make a decision quick
we finish unloading and then and then we
drive the truck away
right we have to yeah let's go it's
quick
and just go back you unload all the milk
yep
yeah i'll we'll i'll retrieve the body
of the private and put him into the back
okay americans are very big on you know
no man left behind and all of that
right okay i'll i'll stay in the back
with
the with the body while you dress i'll
i should be able to all right and
i'll and i'll like take to like take
stock of of the milk and like see if
uh the cat has never come out of the
sewer
and um
[Music]
i mean yeah it's
so people
and and people are like you know like i
said there are people starting to be
around
and i you don't know how the cats are
gonna get the milk into the sewer
maybe that's not your problem i don't
yeah as as as we deliver the as we put
the last crate down i'll
like crouch down and look into the sewer
and say look we weren't
we're not able to get into the sewer
we delivered it too before
if i if i remember right i don't okay
and i don't remember where that was
all right so um
you you do remember that like neris
doesn't want this place found
well she want a hell of a lot of milk
brought to her location
and and wouldn't help get rid of people
without gunshots so
no you know what it's more interesting
if you make it through so um
you have a harrowing drive
through old cairo as there are crowds
around
word has spread that
white people in this truck have been
shooting
yeah you know as you're driving down
the roads there are people just banging
on the side of the truck
um it's it's
a it's a scary tense situation
um there's a lot of swearing in italian
from the front
at times like you know you're like
just driving forward slow enough to try
and park the crowd
mm-hmm you're not you know you're
you you don't want to stop
no because once you stop you're probably
not starting up again
um but eventually you make it
out of old cairo
and um
[Music]
i'm trying to decide which is more
interesting dealing with the egyptian
authorities or dealing with the american
authorities
well for whatever we would go we would
go straight back to the base
right right the question is
you know how how quickly
it's old cairo so the police don't have
a lot of presence so we'll deal with the
base
so i think this is where we're going
to end this episode
things have things have taken a dark
turn here um
and we'll we'll deal with the
fallout
of this whole situation a a u.s soldier
dying in a foreign land
yeah it never happens we can never go
back to cairo now
you say that like we were ever planning
to
hey you know what this is actually one
of the places where we might actually
end up coming back to again
just because we've had so much traffic
here know what no it'll be a c team
i just want to play yeah there you go
yeah the only team that will come in to
clean up but
yeah odd that's true we've had both the
a team and the b team here
yeah one more team no i don't want to
make another character
flint will come in with the japanese
there we go
did you ever make japanese characters by
himself man
samurais there you go
it's a little after the the bushido
period isn't it
it is yeah he's doing a tom cruise's
role as the last samurais he teaches
them how do you write
everything so

through a getting a nun through a portal
would be difficult
i'll try to mess up more in the future

tolerate you in my room

matter and my personal choice
