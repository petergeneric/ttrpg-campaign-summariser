call of cthulhu
thank you so much for spending part of
your geek end with us
we really appreciate it we
are first of all i'm so glad to be
playing call of cthulhu
and not playing any other game that i
will not name here
uh but i it was a great time
playing running for playing a game
that shall not be mentioned
on tuesday night i had a really good
time i'm glad everybody seemed to enjoy
it
tiana it was awesome to have you there
while you were there and julie
uh there's some talk like you know there
was some there was some oscar buzz for
your performance the
if if you've not seen this one shot at
about the middle of the show there are
costume changes
uh you know there was there was some
dramatic lighting it was
it was off the hook julie went crazy
and
in the best possible way it was it
was a lot of fun
so just a few quick announcements
uh as always friends
i want to start on a somber note here uh
because we are we here at question chaos
we've lost something that is near and
dear to all of us
and you know we're gonna we're gonna
keep going
because because that's what we do you
know we just we want to put smiles on
your faces
but i don't know how we're going to do
it without beer
because this my friends is the very last
time that gordon biersch
is sponsoring quests and chaos
until gordon bears meets our demands
until they once again make root beer
there will be no more gordon bierch on
this program
i have flexed my my muscle in my
i have a contract and
in that contract it states if they did
after a year
if gordon beers is not making root beer
it's either me or them
and so next week i won't be here i was
going to say it was a very it was a very
difficult decision but we have come to a
decision
no that is that is that that is we
we thank gordon biersch for their
support
of quests and chaos they were awesome
partners and
probably will be again at some point
uh but until they are they can pound
rocks
what now isn't it pound sand not pound
rocks
is is pounding roxy i don't know
um seth wants to know if quest and chaos
knew i had a contract the contract is
written in crayon by me
um and it was signed by lucy
so i thought it was you know i
thought
it seemed like it would hold up yeah i
mean i mean our kitty overlords run
everything
that is true thank you toxoplasmosis
um so
uh also to address the the elephant in
the room
uh real life has once again uh
uh in interrupted are our fun
amy has a amy has a lot of work to be
she is she wishes she were here playing
with us right now
um she's getting up at odark 30 on
weekends to go
into the ah into her office actually uh
and so she is
uh you know she is taking the advantage
of
the fact that we can she can take some
rest here because she is working crazy
hours right now
so the next two weeks amy will not
will not be joining us which i've run
the numbers
you know statistically that means that
there is going to be 75
less
a good fires but amy come back soon
we miss you
uh so we tonight
uh thanks to thanks to everybody during
tuesday night's insanity and the
the ridiculous amount of bits that
flowed forth we will be doing a t-shirt
giveaway tonight
so it's gonna be hashtag chaos at the
break
uh don't put it in yet because i doubt
it's been put in so
uh thomas in the chat will tell you when
to put it in but it's going to be closer
to the break
and you can enter to win one of the
three t-shirts we have left i think
um no we have as long as you like
certain
certain of our designs better than
others we have plenty of shirts in
plenty of sizes
uh so it's a t-shirt giveaway tonight
uh and always pride of place
the the final announcement goes to our
friends
at birds of paradise the official dice
of the great dean says well the official
dice of me anyway
um have them too of uh
of our game and you know
i just want to once again mention like
they have they they've now expanded they
have a few more
designs available and if you go to
the if you go to their website you can
actually put in the code
chaotic i think it is i think it's
chaotic then you get 15
off which is great i can't say enough
about their shipping
you order the dice you get them you know
i got them
i think about less than a week after i
ordered them now
maybe andrea was doing me a favor i
don't know but the shipping is very fast
you get your dice quickly you also get a
um a little stat sheet for birds
uh from a game that we shall not shall
not name a stat block which
is is super cute and actually uh
my lovely wife rachel just recently gave
some as a birthday present to a friend
of hers
and it was super easy to just give
somebody else's address the dice head
off
boom you got yourself a birthday present
it was it was great so
birds of paradise use them they uh
and and coming soon they're gonna have
parrot shark dice
that is that is my goal they'll have the
that'll be the
the unofficial fantasy version yeah
i'm very excited about this that would
be very cool i have some on order right
now so i mean the other dice so
nice nice so again we have
a full week of quests and chaos
entertainment for you here
monday night apparently
nick julie and tiana first level third
level characters
first first first good job james
run first apparently they drove a dragon
off
well we haven't driven it off yet
we're holding our own and not dying yet
the cliffhanger is its breath attack on
everyone except for me clump together
that is yeah that is smart be away from
everyone else i'm hiding i'd be paladin
i can't be away from everyone
i have to be up in all the crap i mean
how so
like i believe don't dragons breath
weapons go up with their hit dice
so like this is probably gonna be like a
lot of
damage to many of you well i mean we're
all first level characters i think
assault has some of the highest hit
points and she's got 13.
so i you know i think the black pharaoh
is going to show up and like turn back
time when you all die dying we'll find
out some of you are constants
james you're you're welcome to use that
it's a great way to get around
uh killing players it's it's it works
every time they use
it's a literal deus ex machina you mean
a way to get around not
killing players because then you get to
kill them and then rewind time
true it's true i got to you know i did
get to kill i did get to kill nick last
session that was those
uh briefly see if you were playing
first edition d and d a game you would
we will not name
every time you died you'd lose a point
of constitution so like resurrecting
stopped being fun after a while
then you'd go to regeneration which was
weird because all of a sudden you'd have
a bug bear arm okay that's cool though
yeah it could crazy things could happen
it could it could bring mutation
so monday it's ice spire mountain
dragon of ice spire mountain and then
tuesday
the chaos agents are back they were
in initiative are they out of initiative
now
we finished the the combat we ended as
the combat was
was ending because it took literally a
three-hour
session to work through the big fight
that was
right the the the culmination of
ruckus's story
d and d fights wait yeah all of that
i don't think we went through a full 10
rounds well yeah i mean
i i was once again reminded as i was
running it and like i was exacerbating
things you know i was trying to get
initiatives going fast and all that
stuff but
yeah d d fights i know you just blow up
the blimp
it's all done yeah someone suggested
a first edition retro mitten
i could i could totally kill a lot of
people in first edition
that could be really interesting because
i've never played any edition earlier
well if only if i wanted to experience
where we came from
it would be interesting very different
yes older or very different
so yeah tuesday the chaos agents are
back and then we are back here
saturday to do that craziness that we
do
well time is an important word the the
great dane city was caught in a time
loop
and they discovered that one man uh
uh the count was not
caught in the was was also not caught in
the time loop and they had to figure out
how to get him uh
his watch that would that was a magic
item that made him temporarily stable
um they seem to have very little problem
with
uh setting setting the poor count
back
into time with some serpent men
uh they they seemed fine with it and
uh and they they blew up you know the
blimp blew up once
uh nick died once joan almost died it
was
it was all sorts of fun but then
everything was fine
and they have enjoyed the rest of the
the beautiful blimp ride home
or to berlin and they they land in
berlin
uh before we get dive into that we've
got some bits to do
uh first for the players we have
uh 500 bits to the players from my
favorite twitch user the baroness
then we have a thousand bits
from lonely yeti to the players
500 bits to the players from tamagoturo
who says
who who wants to know who will start the
fire when emma's not around
i i think we'll take turns on that one
and last but not least taking food off
i mean okay our table but uh
500 bits to the players from my i can't
remember she might say i think she's my
third favorite
twitch user squirrel on the run
my my lovely wife rachel who gives the
players bits
never gives the gm bits i it's
you know it's become an issue i i i may
mention it every night before i go to
bed
well she's always number one in our
hearts and she says to to make emma
proud
which i i take as a challenge
yeah wow making emma proud is
uh speaking of always in my heart
my favorite twitch user the baroness
gave me
a thousand bits more on that in a
second
and then tamagotora also gave me 500
bits
um because i had to put up with the la
the crazy lot of you
uh in that in that mitten
uh so thank you all for those bits
that's amazing
uh i don't think we'll need any of them
i think everything's fine
uh so very quick gi joe moment here
um i you know we talk a lot
about the animated series and about the
toys we don't talk as much about the gi
joe comic books
which are
[Music]
insane and so idw
an independent comic group they have
the gi joe license currently it's gone
back and forth marvel had it for a while
idw had it then lost it dark horse
um idw had gi joe
in the 90s they ended with gi joe 155
ended on a cliffhanger like a story
about a
a crimson guard member one of the the
cobra people like writing a letter to gi
joe
and then about i don't know this year
idw just all of a sudden put out gi joe
and just picked up after a decade
the same story and followed it through
and it just gets crazier
and crazier and crazier we recently
found out
gi joe has a base called the pit in utah
we recently find out there's another pit
under the pit
there's a even secretor base under the
pit
and in that pit and so far i haven't
seen an explanation for this
is a giant alien eye staring out of the
ground
and fascinatingly they made the choice
idw did to kill their most popular
character
snake eyes the ninja dude uh
and in that series he has been killed
it's
it's insane the the comics
i mean i don't you know i'm not sure
anything in gi joe is canonical really
uh but the comics
like are just super crazy and insane
and well worth a look the old the
old marvel run was
was good but was a little kind of more
well the marvel one was a little more uh
conservative but it had these
insane it would it had a bunch of
like
weird stories about like that's where
you found out that cobra commander was
actually a used car salesman and all
this
it's just it was all sorts of crazy
uh so the the current idw run of gi joe
is doing some very weird stuff
uh so that's that yeah so you
um the great dane society lands in
oh well there we go and we have 500 bits
from stilba
uh who uh
who also enjoys the gi joe comic book
and how everything is a twist
or a and how they change everything
up it's
it's true still but they they
even the old ones were always insane
and always changing things up
and one of the things that i think is
really funny is how
the comic books play with the
the with the constructs of the animated
series
and and all that yes thomas i did get
lonely yetis and tamago's for the
players
was it was was for you that was for me
because i'm the one that said how great
gi joe is
not my childhood uh
yeah wow that's gonna be wheat like uh
anyway i'm old
um that tank was awesome though i still
remember
it must have been the aircraft carrier
that i've i mean that's been a gi joe
moment but the aircraft carrier
was essentially a cardboard box like
thomas had it
and it was like you know it was like
thomas
[Laughter]
yeah you're you're tom here because i
had the aircraft carrier oh you did too
wow yeah we know that
that thomas has it or had it because
oh no
thomas has it that's right although
honestly
he keeps talking like this you know we
need we need to we need a studio show
of you know bringing out the g.i joe's
stuff here yeah joe the heartfelt
we'll we'll play it oh it's called
cthulhu you want you talking about
wanting to do some alternate universes
throw us in the gi joe
there you go it'll be red and blue
lasers the whole way
um so yeah you you find yourself
at the zeppelin terminal which is
essentially a huge open field
uh and you are a
a short ways out of berlin you are um
you are a a car will take you into a
hotel in berlin
i'm not even sure what day it is anymore
i think it was may
11th okay because it takes
there were a couple days after the time
right
okay and you are you are heading
somehow you want to get to cairo um
joan you being and alexander being more
travelers you would know that
it's probably going to be a boat but the
question is
are you going to take the train down
to italy
to then take a shorter boat across the
mediterranean
or take the train to france and you know
get a longer boat
uh from there personally personally as
someone who has never had very good luck
with
boats and i speak italian i'd much
rather go to italy
i i i agree with you i think italy
and the short boat ride
is the way to go yeah we don't want
to go to france
no no gods no
um
i did i did i did want to ask ezra we
were talking at the end last time that
uh we were planning to do like some
psychotherapy with with doctor
yeah thank you for that yeah so you have
two days
on the on the trip so let's
let's just dr alster make me a
yep a regular
okay so joan are you taking part
in this as well
oh yes yes so human therapy
so with a regular you're each gonna get
one sanity back
uh and and
and you've you've all you know you you
keep
building more and more of a rapport as
dr hollister sort of
delves into you know starting to delve
into some of the darker things you've
done
and and figure that out um
uh so brayden ash braden
puts in 1500 bits i'm gonna give it to
the players
oh no it's it's a callback to the mitten
it is 1500 bits to whoever wins a game
of rock paper scissors
between myself and julie all right
dooley are you ready
i'm ready rock paper scissors
ah it covers rock fifteen got it it's to
me
that's two out of three yep uh
and this is where i remind you all
that in our discord braid there's
gonna be a call of cthulhu game
being run like through the chat and
also brayden is also gonna be doing a
24-hour straight marathon of massive
naira lethotep
uh which is crazy uh
yeah even for cthulhu that's crazy it's
you can find information in uh
you can find information in on the
discord about that
uh it is for charity i gotta get in
there and support that but
uh 24 hours is
and the best part is it's literally a
24-hour thing so however far they get
when 24 hours hits the world ends
save it you don't know yeah sure sure it
could
it could all work out fine that's that's
that's
we're not going to save the world in the
end i think we're going to but we're all
going to die in in in horrible ways
while doing it
and the world will never ever be the
same it'll probably be on fire
i mean if emma has anything to say about
it i don't know ezra strikes me as the
kind of uh
kind of storyteller who who will let
the world go on but like
no one that way no one will ever
recognize the the horrible sacrifices
that the party had to make
uh i'm a firm believer that man is the
true monster
so i'm all about you know the horrors
that you
do to are the horrors that you will
inflict upon things to
to save the world worth the cost to you
and to the world
uh we've already found out the answer
was no for the first version of the
world
uh so yeah you you will spend
uh i guess the night in uh
in in berlin and you can get a train the
very next day
to head down uh
head down to it will go to
to venice where you can get on a boat um
they didn't give me rail lines uh
well you know what we've got google why
train berlin why do i have my sound on
god i'm old berlin
to venice need some they might be giants
road movie to berlin
[Laughter]
we have a new segment ezra looks like an
old man at his phone
[Laughter]
so so it's amy doing math and ezra uh
googling things googling things
yes there we go let's see here
um
so nowadays it takes 14 hours
[Music]
three days there we go all right
so so yeah you'll be on the train
so the the morning of the 12th you'll
get on a train
and on the 15th you'll arrive in venice
and you will be happy to know that your
entire train ride is restful
and lovely and you'll all gain one
sanity
from not having anything destroyed or
blown up
or any sort of problem you needed that
you have a and anyone who's taken any
uh unfortunately the one drawback is
that um
the train is not really a great place to
and so it's more this is more like
literal like three days nothing to do
let's go sit in the parlor car
you said nothing to do on the third
day you're all sitting in the parlor car
playing cards
and two gentlemen in priestly garb
uh come up to your table
and he addresses emma and emma
does anyone else speak italian you can
make an italian role
oh this is the first time that i've used
my italians anybody with italian can
make an italian roll
27 made it all right anybody else
okay so emma
um emma and this guy are having a
conversation uh
about how she needs to go honey she
needs to come home
and how the father how the father wants
and and emma
is emma's trying to get out of it
and at one point there's a little bit
and so he will he will
uh he will emma finally you know says
yeah okay okay and he will he says then
i'll see you tomorrow
and he heads back and
uh emma will tell the table that um
she so remember how i work for the
vatican
if you you wouldn't really be let into
the
into the the the sanctum
to come and see rome for a couple days
it's a beautiful city
no question how long i will probably
be it'll probably be uh
two weeks of real life time as emma's
yeah we can't yeah stay there for
two weeks of real life no it's not gonna
be two weeks of uh
unless you guys well who knows actually
a few days would be good there's a lot
of things to see there and i would love
to see some of the
museums and things yeah you know you
know some some
art dealers there might be a good place
to do some research if we had anyone on
this group that are so inclined
well it's also it's also not a bad place
to resupply just sort of in general we
haven't had a chance to
get and get clothes that are more than
the two sets that we each have
if you walk emma will say if you want
clothes go to milan
um yeah alexandra will just grin she's
um so so
emma says all right in that case when we
get into venice
uh myself and and
um monsignor fratelli were uh
going to take another train but if
you guys
it's it's been a long time since i've
been in rome i i would love to
all right when do we need to be in cairo
when is the full moon
yeah good question i don't have the i
don't have the calendar
oh hold on i can pull it up we need
to be
there well before the full moon
and we need several days before solve a
lot of problems before then too
so we can't really delay too much
calendar okay
we decided the full moon is all colored
in right
yes okay no it's all white it's it's the
all-white ones because the
the the black that's the new moon i'm
thinking
maybe amy didn't know that
uh so may 8th was the full moon
the next full moon will be june 6th
no that sounds that's yeah that's
because that's right
when's the next one just so i can write
it down june 6th
what if we arrived in egypt the week
before to get ourselves set up at least
five days before
all right yeah so like by the beginning
of june so we do have a couple weeks
that will be i can't imagine that would
it take us this long to
uh find innocent blood wow i've got all
your dossiers
and yeah
vatican can instruct us on the
definition of innocence
let's try to give ourselves two weeks
yep
well for for for what it's worth we will
be going into a place where all of the
ecclesiastical arguments happen
i'm sure we can find a scholar who can
foreign ritual did kind of
allude to what it meant well
it alluded to what the people who are
doing the ritual have to be it has to be
people who are poor evil
but well stand against evil but that's
not innocent
and that's also not referencing the
blood it's referencing the people who
are doing the writing
yeah okay yep the current pope
is pope pius xi
so so yeah you get on another train
to rome and emma is basically
sequestered
and and she she tells you before
she gets sequestered they're gonna want
to know what i've been doing and i
i'm gonna have to report back but i'm
gonna
going to leave some things out probably
wise
leave out some of the fires if you can
yeah yeah i'm going to leave out most of
the most of the innocent killing
you know i'm going to i'm going to
really gloss over the whole world ending
part
yes because we're gonna fix that
not a problem wait wait wait which world
ending
i mean the one the one you and i already
ah um
you know and all you know all
i don't think i don't think uh
catholic theology really has
a a lot of interest in a multiverse so
i'm probably gonna
yeah gloss over that but man i might
talk
i'll talk a lot about those bunnies i've
got i've got some
i got some stuff i need to get off my
chest about those damn bunions snow them
in with those damn bunnies uh
so so yeah she is she is often about
um and joan
you make me a spot hidden role
regularly you see one evening in the
parlor car
it's a it's about a day from venice to
rome
so on the train from venice to rome
you see an art dealer that you recognize
um from uh
uh from your uh
from what you've been you've been doing
uh
and he he he like clearly recognizes
you
as well and he sort of he sort of you

well you know if you're traveling and
you have art with you sometimes people
do not treat you like you should be
treated
they treat you as a piggy bank you have
art with you
no we are here to look like
like you're the thing that you're
telling me about the uh
the at the machete house so
[Music]
you just said when you have art with you
you need a bodyguard
i will have i'm glad you didn't have art
with you i will have
won't i do you have anything worth
selling
i can get you a good price that's that's
nice to know and i
i remember you and i do appreciate that
will that
you wouldn't hide something from me
would you
not something from not something that i
that was a very evasive answer
not trying to not trying to spook you
not trying to rally you
up i'm trying to do my my what i do
that's donald's job yeah you say that
he's like
oh right i'm sorry i didn't of course
mean to question
uh yes well i'll just be going then uh
we'll see you tomorrow that if you have
any
interesting items that you know you
might you know
okay he'll scurry away
see you tomorrow you're shot where where
uh i think joan has it assuming jones
got it
i have it just no i'm not gonna whip it
out right now guys come on
no i'm saying we should keep a closer
eye on that
right now yes it's not
um it's not a great thing to carry
around don't bring out
stone yeah i was thinking we could do
like we
have done in other hotels and be able to
put it in there and they're safe
sure yeah and it sounds like the the
egyptian craze has continued unabated
good for us maybe
anything in that catalog you might
actually be interested in
we'll see yeah we'll see so you have
a wonderful meal in rome
and you know it's it's nine o'clock at
night
and and rome is just getting going if
anybody wants to
have some nightlife sadly emma has
already headed off to the vatican where
uh i also wanna i wanna quickly shout
out uh
my second favorite twitch user the jay
matthews band
has has come through and he had
500 bits for emma but emma's not here so
instead
yeah fair enough you have to go through
the whole alphabet before you come back
around to alexandria yeah that's that's
that's enough
that's the trick so yeah
you you can spend a night whining and
dining in rome
you can yeah that's we're on vacation
let's
keep it going well i assume have we have
we
uh booked the hotel yeah you you he took
you to the
he took you to the you you're at the
astoria and you have stored stuff in the
hotel safe
i was gonna say if this is the hotel
that he
suggested maybe we want to consider a
different hotel considering his interest
dr hollister in on the back on the
backup hotel plan
not paranoid well
yeah let's let's take this to a backup
hotel and store it there
a place like this prides itself on its
discretion which means that if he comes
asking for something
uh from the hotel safe it's he'll tell
him to come through me
or or it could be a place that he has
connections with
true he does he probably probably has
some connections but
they're not going to they're not
going to put one person like that
over us they won't
okay but i think it's a good idea though
to
have our backup hotel person here to get
one
we we always need to get we always get a
backup hotel that's just the rule yeah
is the backup hotel fancier or worse
than the astoria
so is the astoria like a higher level
discreet country
it's a mid-level it's a very comfortable
hotel yeah
uh first the story let's let's we'll
spend less in the back up i think
um honestly you know the nicer the hotel
the less
discreet it is because you know
anybody who's staying at the palace the
palace wants to be like
guess who's staying here yeah
you should come this person's here yeah
that's right as as someone who was kind
of a name in the opera scene alexandria
wants to avoid places like the palace
cause
no i do not want to be asked to sing at
an opera cafe and have to explain don't
sing opera anymore seem jazz
i mean y'all interested in jazz that's
how the riot starts
[Laughter]
well that's a good point though do we
find any any bars or anything that do
jazz we can
you can make a luck roll yeah i'll join
in on that are we going to
are we doing a group or just a single
person sure do a group luck role all
right let's see
i'm going to need let's see here i'm not
going to stay out too late
though hard success
i got a hard success yes sure yeah
you find
you find a a a jazz bar in a in a
more beat up part of town where you
probably find a backup hotel as well
well i mean if we're not gonna store the
if we're to store the
the tablet or the capstone at the place
that we're at there's no reason to get a
backup
but there's always a reason to get
always a reason for that
we're going we're going to be here long
enough we need a backup hotel
about all right i'm going to throw this
out here no one caused any trouble
yeah that did not work so well on the
dirgi ball
we tried emma even tried to not cause
problems
didn't cause any trouble that was not us
yeah yeah and we didn't need a backup
hotel
to us or exactly exactly trouble trouble
comes to us regardless of where we are
but when it comes to us we don't need a
backup hotel
that's why we need a backup hotel so we
have some other place to go
yes if something happens we go to the
backup it's
around that viewpoint yeah well why not
club jazz club is wonderful the thing
happens
the drinks are strong uh
the jazz is hot it is a beautiful
night
and you yeah you end up staying out a
little later than you planned but you
know you don't have anything to do
tomorrow
so it's fine i'll head out a little
early actually
all right so may 16th is may
let me i need to pull that calendar back
up real quick here and
may 16th is indeed a saturday so
you are fine not a sunday rome will shut
down
yeah not a sunday uh
uh so the next day is saturday
everyone's going to market
uh there are families out and about
there are tourists everywhere
rome is you know an incredibly busy city
but i've got to go see my guy
marco about the catalog
okay uh
suppose we should do some research on
yeah emma emma's talking to theologians
possibly although really we cut to emma
just being browbeat
for hours and hours and hours that's
very catholic yes
uh and they have some questions about
she's like my accountant is not around
yeah well well joe's got our meeting
let's go uh
we check out the costume of the you
know the forum and the other
bits of you know but we are going to be
remember we are going to go on a a tour
and and then and then a talk yeah
right
we're going to with your creepy guys
it's not creepy would libraries
be open today oh yeah on a saturday yeah
though
libraries and museums oh the museums
we we might lose joan at some point to a
museum
so joan you marco has you meet him
at a restaurant
uh and he is um
you know it's it's early for lunch but
he's having an early lunch and he
he you know has you sit down um
oh yes wow i made it
um it is a hard okay wow
that's amazing i got an o3
oh man what's the matter you worried
about this uh
this auction you have in a couple
days worried who's worried
you you sound worried buddy i
don't know what you're talking about
well i do
well i'm wondering why
because i haven't gotten all the pieces
of the things that i need yet
i'm looking for some certain pieces of
things to try to make a
which you wouldn't call it an altar but
you would call it it's it's a production
i'm trying to put together so this is
something that i've gotten for
another another job that i have and i'm
so i'm putting several pieces together
so i can't sell them
i've already been conscripted just like
you're asking me to come and help you
i help other people too so i can't give
you everything at that point
marco puts the cap both pieces of the
capstone on the table he pulls them out
front he says this looks pretty
that's a different capsule again
i thought we were thought we had a
he has two pieces both pieces of the
caps don't
that's already been put back together by
oh right sorry he has one piece yes he
has the whole thing yeah a little kind
of confused
i was very very confused about that
so
you have the capstone why do you have
the capstone i told you i was putting
together
the capstone this thing here look at
that slithy tove made us
a complete capstone this thing here that
you
have unceremoniously plopped down on the
table i put a napkin over it he takes it
off and he's like
don't worry the boys are watching and
you see three
thugs
and then he lowers his voice he says
look
i owe the mafia a lot of money
i need a big sale here
i'm doing this auction on credit hoping
i can get something
i i really hate to do this to you but if
this thing is at all valuable
i'm gonna have to sell it and if you
work with me
i can give you a cut but if you don't
work with me
we're both getting cut okay at this
point alexandria very casually has a
hand on one of the places where she can
alone to this meeting i thought we all
went together
god damn you're all enjoying rome
oh showing me the signs this is why we
uh donald the good news for you
is that get diced has given you 500 bits
all right so that's 500 more to the
party from get dice thank you so much
for that
because sometimes you just gotta kick in
uh so joan
you help me with this situation
yeah but look look
this isn't just some regular sale man
i'm talking about
you know there's big things behind this
if i give it to you then then
neither one of us is gonna be safe no
matter who you got behind us
dude this is this is this is this is not
now
there's there's a cult that wants to do
a mumbo jumbo
so they want this
and all right
i've got to give it to them will they
things have already been people has
already been
paid for this i got to get it to them or
my life's not worth
a damn so if you take it
it's not you're not going to be able to
sell it to anybody you're going to
it's true true you are that you are that
good but
oh man dude you don't understand look
i'm really sorry but this guy's gonna
kill me
they don't those guys don't work for me
they're following me
i i got i mean i thought we were
man i thought we were working together i
thought we were going to do this this
this auction
and be able to make something but i
thought we were too but then you're
holding out on
i mean i told you this isn't it's not
long as you started doing the
well nothing that i want to sell mumbo
and i know you can't pull stuff over but
i'm not selling this for
money do you understand this is like
selling it for them
diamonds
not being killed like kind of like your
sich
if i give it to you you've got the mafia
after you
you know all those egyptian uh
artifacts and things i've been bringing
in
yeah some of that caught up with me
so this artifact you got some egyptians
chasing you
some really nasty ones here's the thing
i can get you mafia protection i just
have to pay them off
yeah i know but this thing is not our
ticket we got to find another ticket for
you
and you don't want to go to egypt right
now that place is crazy
i know but you gotta go
all right oh everything i've done is is
for nothing
what have you done everything
look man i really man i've done you know
you know you've worked with me for a
while
you've seen some of the things i've
brought in right i i have yeah
that's why i knew you'd have something
worthwhile something valuable
we do have people that's why i have to
have the muscle man i got people chasing
after me and stuff
they they're separate factions they're
separate things who want to get this
you don't want to get your buddies into
that at all you just yes
yeah yeah
oh i actually did all right so
you stopped just short of ranting and
raving about all of the people that are
chasing you
look i'm i'm really sorry but i
can't do anything they're gonna kill me
well you took it then you gotta figure
out how to dump it
i can sell it tell me who you sell it to
let's do that way tell me who you sell
it to
all right yeah you know what i i owe you
that much
cool cool and then probably it's
probably gonna be
uh i'm it's
i mean something like this let's see
he'll make an appraised roll
i mean i think i'm gonna have to sell it
you so you know he's talking about a a
german antiquities dealer who is
super disreputable but buys
almost anything
okay is he based here yeah he's here in
rome
all right but i
look i will tell you who i sell it to
and
i i'm still you can say no if you want
but i'm still
if you would represent me at that
auction you know there'd be some cash in
it for you
why don't you want to go well because
again
uh i am not welcome in that house
oh so you are looking for somebody so
you you think you're gonna make me want
to do you a
a a a solid after this
i'm gonna i said i'd pay you but i too i
completely understand
if you're not no no no i gotta do it i
gotta do it
i hope you buy this back from from from
warner
um we have 500 more bits for the players
from stilba
who suggests you bash him on the head
and take it
[Music]
again that's a good point
we'll give first uh
all right so so yeah he will he will
put the the capstone
back in a satchel and then he will
say
um he will say something in italian to
the three goons
and they will usher him out
to a waiting car what about he catalog
he does he does look back apologetically
what about the catalog man when are we
gonna talk about that it'll be at your
hotel
all right uh
and you you you had so you all
sort of you guys were out for the
morning doing some uh
trying to beat the tourists to
sightseeing you come back to the hotel
for lunch and
holly you were right
what was he right about this time what
happened
i went to meet the backup hotels
with marco and guess what he plopped
he took the stone
son of a badge didn't we just put that
in the hotel safe
yeah this hotel
yeah that we're standing right now yeah
where is he he is in the company of some
mafia
and he's attempting to sell the stone he
said once he sells it
he'll let me know who he sold it to
i am still going to go to this
house and bid on some objects because if
they have some antiquity objects there
from from uh
that is so unimportant right now can
we get guns
okay we've got one are we can i contact
someone from the embassy and uh
help us here yeah can can
i go so you're gonna go to the
american embassy and ask for guns
um well and and and here here's my
question do we want to continue staying
at this hotel or do i go
and and and dress them down in very
angry italian
before firm for are are things being
stolen
before storming out i'll tell you what
why don't i go up right now well
i did i didn't want to do anything
without you guys here let's go up right
now and see if they'll give me my my
satchel back with my things back and
if not and then we'll storm out what do
you guys think
let's do it let's get sure let's
but do i think that we can being a
i'm pretty government employed do i
think that i could get
uh some party government employed you
know like you'd have a better chance at
a military base
all right but it is is there one
is there a military base here i don't
not that you know it all right then i'll
i'll i'll put in a i'll really quickly
run put in a phone call
to rogers to
thank you at the embassy to see if they
can find something for me
okay all right yeah he will he'll um
the you you you leave a message because
you know it's
it's a difference and um
and you you tell him to get back to
me at the hotel
i mean it's a i mean it's more of a
message for delta green
to get someone an authority to contact
them and
yeah okay uh
and you yeah you come up to the
desk and there's a very nice
very nice young man there
well-dressed uh
hello welcome welcome to the the
hotel story how can i help you
yes well you're staying in you are
staying in the plaza suite
yes well i had put my bag in the
safe and i would like to get my
things out now of course of course one
moment
i will be right back and he will go and
uh uh
there's a uncomfortable pause
and about
10 minutes later he comes out looking a
i'm not very i'm very sorry but um
you're sorry
yes it appears that that um
our safe was inadvertently left open
overnight and everything in it seems
to have disappeared
we have our hotel detective working
on the case right now
if you can just please write down
everything that was in the bag
like the entire bag no i go full jersey
on him
okay i start just cussing and yelling
and saying no way this is this is
this is the most horrible experience
i've ever had and and then
yeah yes italian we're johnny we're very
sorry the the hotel
story apologizes profusely um
apologies and and alexandria joined then
in
in italian do you think an apology is is
enough we had our valuables
like full diva scene
yes yes of course your room is not
no charge no charge me
and my friends are leaving this hotel no
charge
will be given to us no no of course of
course
if you will tell us your address i will
if we find your bag
i will bring it to you we will have it
sent to you
so we we we did establish the secondary
hotel right
yeah yeah i'm not telling them i'm not
saying
i'll come back and and check in with you
i'm not telling you where i'm going
clearly your your your staff is not
for the us embassy here okay yeah he
he does not recognize the address so
he's just like okay well yes
if we find it we will have it sent there
of course of course
um and and you do that after we
move off a little bit right you you give
them that
address we'll move off a bit and then
you'll go here here's the address oh no
i'm while you're there
i i push in and like no this needs to be
this is
the government property was taken
he could be the good cop we're we're
where are they i know but i was gonna
try to okay
good copying i i'm not pleasant in the
slightest towards them
compared to the rage of the two women
you see probably seem downright
uh pleasant that's
bad cop and cop
there we go no of course we are very
sorry and we will we will
we will do everything we can to find
this
uh that that seems to be his default
sort of you know
and i mean fair enough he's he's a
minimum wage worker at the front i feel
bad for him
uh yeah i'll i'll go collect my things
and come back down and be like
yeah yeah yeah yeah i just figure if we
yell out enough at him his boss will
hear too so he'll know that we know
somewhat someone understands that that
there's some rage going on
yeah yes no it has been clearly uh
clearly spread
oh i was saying that we're not we should
not be going to the backup hotel right
now we should be hunting this guy down
no it's not gonna work let's go back
let's talk first store our things we
could plan there
hold on okay so the satchel contained
the cap not just that capstone but
a ton of incredibly dangerous arcane
knowledge
i remember correctly that's correct
that's where all the notes are is
isn't it yeah this isn't time to play
around we don't have to
stay that stuff up right now we have
more important things to do
as you are walking out of the hotel the
poor guy comes
running up very excitedly with the
satchel
and he's like we have found it we have
found it
here here here it is it was in the
garbage in the in the kitchen
oh right what's missing from that
satchel
uh the only thing missing is the
capstone at least the notes are all
there
yeah but i'm gonna still tell them to go
okay but they still
stole from it oh what did they take i
i can't even okay
what but thank you for the best most of
it's back
uh i thank him very brusquely for the
bag
um and after and after we step out of
his earshot hollister he's with the
mafia
the mafia is not someone to mess around
with in italy
and i'm glad we still have the papers
i'm glad you thought about that
i thought for a second nick froze but
his eyes are just shifting back and
forth
we're still not prioritizing well well
let's
let's go to the back up number one wrap
our things up
and immediately plan from that location
it shouldn't take us much more time
not here on the street we're gonna
discuss it here on the side no we've got
to go
all right so you head to the hotel
fountain view
which is not in view of any fountain
and it is a it is a cdr hotel but you
know
um and donald and
joan both of you make me what do you
make me
credit reading roles okay
hey 20. that would be a hard success
all right with a hard success um
you you are pretty sure that you could
find some black market
um they might be mafia contacts but you
know
joan i mean i don't know anybody in
italy but i do know some people but
maybe they can put me in touch with
somebody here
rome is a hub for this sort of trade as
you know
find someone who could connect us with
someone and in a back alley out at the
back of a truck we'd probably purchase a
couple of items
sounds like a plan you know i'm not
still getting your crowbar i mean as as
alexandria is absolutely adjusting one
so you need to get a rifle that has like
oh that's outstanding
um so i'll make some calls from the
hotel once we've settled
i guess that would be sure
oh yeah you you get in your new hotel
and um
uh don't put anything in the safe no
no no no no i'm not keeping everything
with me now i'm just gonna have a bath
this hotel a little more because the guy
says they don't have a safe
yeah actually i may have been having a
backpack this whole time
it's not the worst idea yeah so for the
first time in our story i'll i'll call
uncle ryan
and i oh nice yes and who's been on my
sheet this entire time
yeah yeah you send a probably send a
telegram yeah
uh so you you you will telegram him and
he will send you back
um a name and an address and
uh he says um
you know basically every night at 9
00 pm
at this address ask for
this guy so you have a name to ask for
and that will
uh that will get you what you want
i'm gonna stop by the embassy yeah sure
so you stopped by and um
[Music]
uh they um
when you introduce yourself they say oh
um
yeah we have we have a note for you hold
on
and he brings back a little
diplomatic pouch
and he hands it to you i shall open this
pouch
all right inside the pouch is ten
cold hard american cash nice oh it's not
in the local currency
it is not american american dollars
spend a little better
okay all right well the black market
okay thank you all right i will take
this back
this the clerk like you open it there
and the clerk's just like
oh i have i i have a moment where my
eyes bug out too and then i collect
myself
and i'm like this should solve our
problem yes not
what i expected but i'm underpaid
well this isn't for me if it makes you
feel any better
little i guess uh
you know please if i can help you in any
other way sir you know we're here for
you
i don't want to rope you into this
anymore than i already have you
you've been fantastic the the less you
know the better
okay that is that is something of rome's
motto
does donald tell the rest of us about
a contact of mine knows a fellow who who
runs a small market there and
um i'll tell the time location um
alexandra if you go with me you speak
the language i don't
um we're looking for this fellow i'll
give you the guy's name
i can make a purchase of the doctor
who's into us the two of us can
pick some equipment up so are
all four of us going or is it just you
and me
um i imagine that the rest that's fine i
don't i wasn't told it was just a
personal invitation that's a little
market than a meeting
i'm i'm a little worried that in a
little market a group of four people
will stand out but i defer to your
knowledge on this one
i mean oftentimes if you make it
purchase this you usually bring a couple
of people with you
it's you know it's yeah it's not a
one-on-one transaction especially for
buying a few items
well then tonight it is all right
10 o'clock i thought it was nine or nine
o'clock
yeah whoever is on my telegram it likes
to be fashionably late
um but i don't i don't think we have any
other contacts to really like chase down
the mafia like alexandria has been to
italy before but not very often in a
professional capacity
joe most people in the in the the not at
all stolen art world
um and you know maybe you and i mean you
could go
and visit that warner guy yeah
or something like that but for the most
part um
yeah the mafia is a whole different
world
from the world you travel in if if you
think that that is the most likely
person who is going to receive it
some checking out the location for
perhaps later removal
might not be the worst idea that's
actually a very good idea
if it's in the hands of the mafia that's
a that's ridiculous for us we can't
attack
if a single buyer obtains it brings it
to his location
that's where we obtain it do do i know
who this warner guy is does he travel in
the same circles or anything
so you know of yeah you know of him he
is a a german
uh art dealer who is
uh fairly indiscriminate he will buy
almost anything
but he tends to not pay quite as much
because of his wide berth and
everything that he sells gets uh
usually gets sent back to germany
everything that he buys
gets sent back to germany to sell there
we have to go
back to berlin um
have i gotten back yet or yeah yeah it
is the night of the 16th
or the the afternoon of the 16th yeah
right
i will well this is the assistance
that we got
show them the envelope you walk in and
hollisters lying on a bed rubbing in
yeah i i'll definitely let out a low
whistle and be like well
that will go a long way where we're
going tonight
we're not taking that all with us you
understand
yeah this seems like overkill we're not
going to leave it in a safe either
should be sufficient right at the same
time i'm not leaving it here in the
hotel room
so okay all right so we have a couple
ways of dealing with this
i don't know if the stone has been sold
yet
maybe we could buy it back because he
needs money
did he say how much but this isn't the
solution he didn't say
how much he was just saying he needed to
sell it can you get in touch with him
you know you can get a message to yeah
right
that fella werner he said he pays but he
doesn't pay a lot correct
warner warner is
he he deals in he deals in by very low
try to sell very high kinda
we might be able to out bid him and thus
make this a lot
easier i would try i didn't want to get
into a bidding ward or anything like
that i was just thinking if i could
figure out how much he needed
if it made sense because he knows we
could tell
i could say hey man i know this warner
guy he's not going to give you a lot
just get in touch with him and find out
how much he's selling it forward to him
okay we may be able to make a
counteroffer but don't allude to a
number
nope got it we just got raided
we got raided by a gob knight and
a
penguin witch doctor welcome uh
uh friends from hereby dragons d have uh
have just jumped in we're playing
call of cthulhu and currently
they're trying to buy an arcane relic
back from the mafia
and you know with with varying levels
of success
yeah so yeah you sit you
you get a message through to to marco
through your
contacts yes and and
so you wanna go check you want to go
check out that varner's store is
that what you want to do
yeah in in in case we're not able to
outbid him
we we want to get the lay of the land so
that if someone needs to get hoisted
through a window we know which window to
get hoisted through
sure yeah it's a gallery kind of
close to downtown of rome
um it is just a a small
uh glass-filled room uh
that has uh
a lot of statuary in it a lot of uh
roman statue
it seems like most of the stuff here is
is is roman
um alexander uh
joan you can make a um
uh not evaluation what is the word
uh phrase appraisal phrase you can make
hard yeah most of this stuff is crappy
or even fake
okay this reminds me of something yeah
okay
seen this kind of stuff and then uh
i mean if we're there with her we want
to just be kind of looking checking the
place out
yeah casing it the way that donald and i
would
when several when several when
several
americans come in uh
a a tall blonde willowy gentleman
in a an ill-fitting suit almost
immediately materializes
oh hello welcome to the honors gallery
what
what do you want to find welcome to rome
are you looking for curios
yes i'm very curious
oh god the dad joke
yo make me a credit rating roll
hmm okay
um so he kind of looks at joan for a
second but then he just continues into
his standard patter
and he's well this is you know this
is a wonderful place to find
all sorts of things that you can't find
you see this lighter this lighter was
oh wow and over here in this case
those are four of the teeth of john the
baptist
god has the teeth and the finger bone
from saint augustine
so i kind of go with him and i go over
oh and let me and
let me see let me see you know being
that kind of yeah yeah
windows and doors yeah and and and
donald i just like glance each other
split off and then start looking at all
the entrances
yeah it is this is not a very sick
this is not a fortress or anything like
that
um it is a glass front building
and there's a there's a single door
entrance and it looks like there's an
office
behind it but he clearly does not live
here there's not like an upstairs or
anything like that
okay there are apartments above this
but he the office seems like it's uh
almost a
are there any windows that that we can
see coming in or is it just front door
so the fro again the front of the
building is a glass facade
right not very easy to get a knife in
and pry open though
yeah we'll probably do back door
entrance probably but
or even even the front depending on the
i'm still keeping them occupied gushing
over all these things this
is one of the nails from the one true
cross
yeah how did you even
oh wow i know a guy at the vatican
right so so after after we've done our
event yeah you have totally cased this
place
yeah we'll we'll circle back around joan
and be like oh we we
we need to go for our meal
appointment
we have reservation oh well thank you
oh of course of course i can't interest
you in any um
i have holy water oh god i wish i wish
emma was here
i gotta go they made me go i have uh
i and like as you leave he's just like
oh man okay
thank you for coming and out we go
yeah and out you go it's you know
it's heading towards the evening
getting it getting getting in there
might be a bit of a trick there there
there are two well there's at least one
door that we saw but there are no
windows
he's either to be some sort of
underground black market buyer of some
sort it doesn't
doesn't strike me as all that serious
uh so joan this goes back to the good
stuff goes back to germany
right right right so crappy right i
explained to that is that yeah anything
that that
is deemed good gets sent in here is he
just it's his front
where does he keep the good stuff
that's a it's a good question you guys
didn't see any back room doors or
anything like that
there was a probably a storm a supplier
but it was a pretty small
facility i wouldn't i'd be suspicious or
i'd be
doubtful he's keeping anything good at
that property well let's find out if he
indeed has this thing
yet maybe we can catch him before he
gets sells it
and so let's see if we i i need to go i
need to go
to marco's place we need to we need to
so you would already you'd like
put out a message to marco essentially
all right um
and so when you when you guys get back
to your
to the hotel fountain view uh
there is a in the lobby there is a
very conspicuous man in a trench coat
reading a newspaper
i i like side eye and just and you know
mark him
in my head and he doesn't even pretend
he like drops the newspaper and he just
sort of watches you go
and i just watch him also not also not
at all subtle
an italian man yes he's italian yeah and
when you go to the um
when you go to the the front desk to get
your key oh
oh yes professor lam you have a
message
we have another appointment at nine
right yeah
it is it's it's like you know 5 30 or 6
right now how equipped are we
i mean i am never without at least five
daggers
but other than that i i just concealed a
single pistol for the trip that's all
i've got
i'm entirely useless for this sort of
thing
this is in my backpack i think i i still
also had a 38 that i was able to sneak
on that i that i can get to
yeah i'll i'll i'll be like i'll say
magic
and just like subtly i can't i i i
don't know if i'd be carrying it on my
person i would need to go to the hotel
room for it
not be able to what i said not the
younger person yeah
yeah okay yeah let's go up and do that
the guy waits patiently oh oh
i'll go into my room grab it hand it off
to him and you're probably better with
this thing than i am
and and i i i'm assuming it's already
loaded
if you have any you have spare
it's 38 and it's got um
you know eight shots eight shots but do
you have any extra ammo
ah a little bit it's got eight shots oh
just see it okay
oh well okay hopefully we'll do this
quickly
hopefully we'll be able to pick up more
ammo from uh
donald's contact yes i don't think
there's a problem it's 10 o'clock
this evening but yeah that's later
yeah so well we've got three hours so

the charm and and engage him just
chatting
back and forth and occasionally
translating for everyone but definitely
definitely keeping him busy yeah he is
um
uh he is he drives you to a
restaurant
that is somewhere you have no idea
where you are
in in rome you're in some neighborhood
this is a small
trattoria it's like a family-owned
restaurant
um and and he says um
they're waiting for you inside i'll wait
here
did i ever catch his first name no he is
not there are no names
okay i'll i'll i'll thank him very
politely
in fact he'll say he doesn't want to
know your name you don't want to know
his name
nope vernon
uh so yeah you come into the the this
this little tratoria
and there is
a a booth with like a beaded curtain
and in front of that booth is a table
and sitting at that table is um
is marco there are at least
four thugs that you can see
donald and i are both making note of
where where they are and where they are
in relation to the entrances
yeah and and joan you think marco
looks nervous again
yeah yeah it's basically what he's at
now
all right perhaps you do the talking we
stay back
sounds like a plan marco
uh professor lam you said you needed to
talk to me
yes because
because of the interesting provenance of
this
this item i was wondering
oh he like
he look he kind of does a sideways
glance at
the the beaded curtain at that and he
says
uh well i'm i'm interested
i need a great deal of money uh
fairly quickly and
how much would you be willing to pay for
a piece
like this and he puts the capstone down
how much do you need what is your
current offer
uh well i have spoken i have a
and and he once again looks kind of
at the beaded curtain for a minute and
he says i have uh
i have somebody who's willing to go as
high as fifteen thousand dollars
how close are we to the curtain right
now so you are
you all came in the front of the
restaurant the beaded curtain is at the
back of the restaurant
and marco's table is in front of that
okay so it's the curtain's in front of
us right yes you can see
sort of there's a figure you can kind of
see through the beaded curtain sitting
at the table
okay in there you got an
offer of 15 000
for this i did varner couldn't believe
it either
varner was going to offer me 10. i'd
if you'd much rather sell to me
and what are you gonna get what and
i'm still gonna be working with you
what are you gonna what do you sell it
i mean i've i'm i've got the offer for
15 but
but you know i i feel like
well i'd be able to i i see it the way
it is and the way we have things right
oh no no no no i i couldn't i couldn't i
mean maybe
yeah do we want to go outside and
um one of the one of the thugs
in in very muscular italian
no and i'll reply in very musical
so our thing means nothing
you you you know
it does it doesn't mean anything to you
giving you a five thousand dollar
discount
no 500 dude 500. oh
i have an offer for 15 000 and i said do
you id
i'm cutting my own throat here
and it looks like the guys around here
because you are a buddy of mine and
because we're still working together i
could do
six and
that's a solid right there
you can
[Laughter]
we might i look
it's got to be eight eight is as low as
i can go
and when he says that you hear a very
curious sound
um from behind the beaded curtain
a weird high-pitched lilting voice
oh is there somebody back there who
would this put me in mind of like a
parrot's voice
because your invitation makes me think
like a parrot
no there's you clearly see a a a human
fit
figure or i guess humanoid uh
does the humanoid figure move when the
speaking happens
oh so you
you and every time the voice behind
actually everybody make me a spot hidden
role
so anybody who makes it every time
oh john you're not talking to the
fellows in charge here
that's what it sounds like is there
somebody else who wants to be in on this
and i look at that looking to the inside
you pay the man so the man can pay me
because his debt must be paid and he
says
that's the case and the debt is to you
why don't we
i saw that look on ezra's face yes
uh marco looks very worried he's like no
no no no no
you i have the piece you're going to
sell
that's right i mean just buy the debt
from this other fella here we paid the
debt off and then
this fella owes you
you are you are merely the intermediary
since you are the one who got in such
yeah yeah okay but but still i mean you
need this
and you buy it from me and then i can
pay
i can pay them off you don't want to
deal with them
why not why why are we doing this like
this
why are we sitting here when these are
the people who
want who want the money they won't let
me go
i don't care not our problem you're
you're the one who got yourself into
this trouble fella
joe just buy the debt from the fellow in
charge here they give us the item
whatever happens to this other guy i
don't care
you wish i care buy his debt no
we if we bought his debt
what would that take
[Music]
how much do you have how much how many
souls do you have to offer
there it is ah and and then and that has
alexandra's hand casually resting on one
of her daggers just like
nope i find what we're playing point at
him
i point at marco when i say his
i already own his
so
to get marco to be if we if we buy
from him if we br buy him from you it
will cost more than money you need souls
i don't want to buy his debt i'm
asking no no we need
i know that's the only way i'm willing
to make this offer
otherwise we'll deal with whoever else
the seller is
we do not care what he does
i can make sure you get this stone
a fair deal i've never heard that before
so it's already unfair this guy has
i say we give you six and then you can
do whatever else you need to do but i
and i say and the figures start there's
movement
behind the curtain here we go yeah
i'm looking at marco i'm staring at
marco i'm not i am watching i know you
guys are doing anything
i am [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] marco is like marco is in
like
if i stand still maybe they won't notice
me you know tyrannosaurus rex
a man sort of but mostly kind of
very beetle looking he's got two massive
mandibles where his his jaw kind of
comes out there
um he has the the the the
multi-faceted eyes but he's
dressed in like he's got a jacket over
himself and he's got a
a a hat on and he um
uh he says he has stolen from you
and he re he just leans down and his
mandibles rip
thank god 12 just made it oh you're all
surprising that so
you all lose two sanity god damn it i
just got that back
i know the combination of marco
having his head ripped off
and that doesn't bother me i was going
to do that for him
yeah that part isn't oh that bothers me
i i take it i totally take it i totally
take it i'm like
and as marco's body like slumps down
the the the the beetle guy puts his
hand on the cap stone
pulls it to himself i was gonna grab it
the mob guys are okay with all this just
make sure the mob guys
uh interesting yeah
oh here we go i succeeded
all right so everybody i'm too messed up
that's a that's actually
o2 an o2 would technically be a extreme
success on that all right so wow
so dr hollister and donald you i also
got it
um you are both aware so you two got
a regular success right alexander
okay so with a regular success they
don't seem phased by this
uh donald and dr hollister with with
harder better successes
they have seen this before this is
you know this guy seems to be the boss
and they're just accepting of
this insanity oh god
i'm thinking really hard in my head
beetle bomb
anyway we just got another raid cranio
dad has raided us
hi welcome that's great i would have to
say that we need raid for this
[Laughter]
we're dealing with a timing massive
beetle so yes thank you
thank you for the rain they just met a
beetle gangster who is
uh extorting them thanks for rating
cranio dead
so yeah he is holding the capstone in
he like in his hands and he says now you
deal with me
money means nothing to me well then what
was the point of selling the thing if
the money wouldn't buy off his debt
who that's the whole point of us being
here is so you could take our souls
you're gonna steal from us too is that
it is that what you're trying to do
[Music]
uh i keep glancing at donald and
alexandria waiting for some sort of
signal
you'll know
you want capstone i want
souls
well all we've got is money i don't even
know what the soul
is
what what hold on hold on hold on just
what what would you consider to make the
blood of someone
innocent
holly i get the feeling that he might
know
in a sense is delicious
and that innocence feeds powers beyond
possibly all i know is innocence is
delicious
and and when you're looking for
innocence how do you recognize it
or do you are you just pleasantly
surprised when you come across it
yeah in a sense
innocence is not found innocence
appears yeah
a bit of beetle man you want souls is
this a
form of currency or something it's a
code for some
particular kind of substance illegal
substances or something
you may call me scaravetti
souls you're looking for souls
yes in all the wrong places
about to say we don't have any souls
i mean alexandria i'm thinking about it
alexandria is a ginger she doesn't have
like what in a bottle or something what
i don't understand how do you
he he motions at marco
god
it's not what we do that's not what we
do what i do is i get things like the
capstone
i sell it for money and
so you know this is the kind of thing we
do and that's why i was working with
marco here
but he stole from me now can you really
yes but it's not a soul so why do you
need it just give it to me just give it
to me
all right so you're getting your fill
i've only had
it's mine dude it's
mine it was mine he stole it
it is mine give it to me
was ours in italian
uh in italian
he says our guests have questions
uh and when he says that the the four
and there is a palpable
uh we should we should probably go john
you could work for scar already they've
already attracted the attention of
in rome there is no one bigger than
scaraveti
i'm not talking about rome
ah
we play a game that that that has the
multi versus pieces
and that's one of the pieces you're in
aravetti understood very little of that
that's fine we barely understand it
ourselves but do you know anything
about do you know anything about
listen we don't have any cells why don't
the four of us leave and
bring scarab his souls at a later
date
we're not in a position to bargain right
now you bring me
five souls i give you
capstone
we should go we should definitely go
yeah i'll as i pass as i pass donald
murmur i have an idea
all right yeah so you you head out um
and your driver is like leaning against
the car smoking a cigarette
and when he sees you he gets in and he
starts the car and he asks where you
want to go
back to the hotel don't worry pick
this up
and he'll drive off as fast you know uh
he's he bids you a lovely good night and
he
all oh right let's meet up somewhere
after this what time what what time is
it approximately
uh it's about eight
we should probably obtain the weaponry
that you need
oh yeah start but we're going to be
dealing with a lot of trouble here
um where do we think he's holding that
to keep you in the restaurant or
yeah any meeting we're going to have
with him is going to be on his terms
if only emma was here with explosives
i was thinking about burning down that
restaurant seriously
hold on i i have i have an idea i'm sure
you really want to go burning down mafia
restaurants
no you really don't yeah well but that's
we want those bits
[Laughter]
there already are they can't take them
back yeah alexandra
what is your what do you think
i'm sure most of you know at this point
and i look over at hollister in
particular because he's the newest one
to the group
i'm i'm waiting for you to i'm waiting
for the plan
i actually don't know does delta greed
know what i what i do for a living
cool it would not be uncommon
for me to work in a city like this i can
get in touch with it
with my contacts find out if there's any
jobs that require my particular skills
here
and offer them as the souls
that is an option right but it's an
optional indeed i was more thinking that
we would
uh set up a meeting time with this the
bug man
and then attack him before that meeting
time every time that
that we have done something like that
one of us has ended up near death
yeah that's one of the reasons why i'm
uh
he's going to contact delta green about
this so they can uh
they can solve it but before they solve
it we want to get that capstone
yes yes because delta green works
with
a broad brush all right so
uh at this point in time though
i'm sorry oh how are they how active are
they in italy
i don't i don't know oh it'll it'll be
it'll be
so that right now they work with a broom
and they manage to sweep up everything
uh relations between the us and italy
are a little are starting to be strained
yeah heading into the 30s yes yeah
i'm sure this will improve it
all right so we we
we obtained some souls
but then at the at the same time we let
delta green under
know and understand that we have a
problem here and maybe they can help get
rid of it
but let's tell them after we've gotten
the
capstone back that's our
objective that's what we have to do
i don't think that's what we have to do
the facility would lose the capstone we
do need to get that capstone back
that's the most important objective
that's that's true but we could still
not usually one to push for violence but
at this point
i mean delta green has a good record of
going in with weaponry let's see let's
see what our options are at nine o'clock
okay all right but i still think we have
the right way of going
i'm not thrilled with giving this thing
souls
but if we get rid of it right after that
i mean there's still five people that
have been sent to it
yeah and i mean yeah it would it it
would happen in my line of work
anyway it doesn't bother me particularly
however i don't think you've taken any
souls in your line of work
i've killed people in my line of work i
think that's different than
souls maybe so
but their lives end one way or the other
all right yes but they're souls
that's that that's a fork in the road
i suppose it depends on whether or not
you believe in souls or an afterlife
if emma were here she'd have something
to say about that but um
yeah and the bug man believes in them
they have some value to him
and i don't know if you could bring i
don't know how you collect that soul
you'd have to kill in front of him just
bring the the
person to him that's easy enough
annoying but easy
let's let's go to our meeting at nine
and see
sorry alexandra alexander is not
actively trying to be scary but
no but but no jones head is going
a million miles an hour and i think
having a
meeting with underworld figures is
probably
good for her right now i hear they have
tommy guns
in this in this area i mean if if we
can get tommy guns to match theirs
i don't like tommy guns they hurt they
hurt a lot
and they're hard to carry it's an
imprecise weapon it's not a great
tool it's more for the terror or the
suppression of a
opposition that's not really used
i'm sure they'll have options you know
what i just realized if we had been
standing directly in front of scaravetti
they wouldn't have fired too ain't too
great of a chance of hitting their boss
do we want to use that next time
definitely
can we get their boss out in the open
where i can shoot them in range
we're pretty sure someone that looks
like scaravetti is not going out in the
open
can you imagine him walking around the
streets of rome even i know where his
beach house is
even though even though he even
though he tried to flint it up with
the hat and everything
i was so thinking of flint
he tried to flint it up with the suit
and the hat i mean yep
right let's go if you kill him you might
no ezra would do that
all right so you know you guys are going
to head out to your uh
uh your your black market assignation
um and you know you
you meet a guy fredo who is happy to
he's like yeah yeah just come take a
look in the back of this truck
and in the back of the truck there are
uh you're glad
emma is not with you because there are
explosives
there are machine guns there are
rifles
maybe i should get some explosives god
damn it she's rubbed off on you
i know a guy in the i know a guy in
the military uh
got all this what you want what you want
good prices good prices
all right i mean the donald's gonna
start out by getting a pair of shotguns
for himself
okay all right also the fun the nicest
looking the most reliable
looking rifle a long-range asset as well
so two shotguns and a rifle all right
that's a starting point what else is the
rest of the group looking for
i'm going to grab a 38
and i'm going to get good amount of ammo
because i go yeah only a pistol
it's 38 it's fun
it's a it's a well made a 38 doesn't
come anywhere near
45 as far as stopping power but look
bombs and i don't like guns
that's bombs and and those
okay what kind of explosives walk me
and some dynamite all right good
well let's let's pick up i'll take a set
of four of each
four grenades and a nice one kind of
uh
what do you call it a roll of divine a
bushel
looks like something the wiley coyote
would have you know these are
this is by the stick of mark important
donald make a demolition's role donald
oh goodness
fun times well it's been a minute since
we've used that skill
where is that i think we have that in
cockpit it's not on there
oh you're right you you that's right
that was your different character idea
you were
gonna be oh yeah all right yeah
everything's fine great
it doesn't look like anything's built
what would i have a good bit of
chemistry
are we looking for the stability of that
dynamite thank you
if it's got any leaks or like
nitroglycerins
oozing out all right make me a kim roll
sure
so the the dynamite seems fine the hand
grenades
um are again those 1920 hand grenades
that are
like you know not like pull a pin it's
you know
yeah it's turn and or you know and what
essentially is happening is you're
breaking a seal
and you know that seal is somewhat
tenuous
so this is well so what i want to ask is
is there a
uh does any of this does he have any
very secure cases for putting explosives
in if he's selling explosives
oh no he's selling it all out of the
crates that he got it from
from the army like the crates say like
italian military you know right
straight out
so doctor what do you tell us what you i
mean well do they do they seem
fine do they seem yeah they seem fine
but just you know you remember from some
experiences with emma that you know
things like falling down can set off a
grenade
you know well yeah that's why i i made
the common sense role in my head of i'd
like somewhere secure to put these
ironically the dynamite is in some ways
safer yeah
i mean without a without a case why is
fire you know i mean
alexandria is definitely having
flashbacks to the last time she saw
these sorts of grenades
yeah and i mean so i mean it comes down
to is anyone good with grenades
i'm more interested in setting
explosives if we're doing something
but yeah i mean you just throw them
you throw them in into a car for
instance into a room
things like that you can throw them on
to the dynamite
oh jeez they're kind of just point and
shoot really
i mean all you do with a grenade is you
break it you go to the army barracks
where the british are you throw it in
the window that's what you did
i don't like reach up and pat him on the
back of the shoulder there there dear
i mean yeah i'll i'll mention that
without somewhere secure to put the
grenades i'm not thrilled with them
yeah i'm not i'm not a big grenade
person but but dynamite i
i can deal with with with no emma here
to argue in favor of them i think all of
us are against
yeah somewhere you hear a voice whining
quietly for for
for grenades all right we'll let the
grenades behind to see a little bit the
skittish about you buy four sticks of
dynamite yeah that's like forcing
two shotguns a rifle four sticks of
dynamite 38
anything else yeah anyone comfortable
with that
i'm i'm not the machine gun fella anyone
else feel comfortable using one of these
large
i've had some practice with hand guns
anything past that
um you're asking for trouble i'm i'm not
strong enough to handle those things you
know that
that's unfortunate we've got a lot here
for you john yeah
and then there's a soul-eating beetle in
front of you and
you wish that a chain gun if you get too
close to him you know what's going to
happen to your
head
yep considering that i have not
had a lot of experience with firearms
you probably don't want me to have them
near you
is there is there a bayonet here a
shotgun is easy to use i'm sure you can
handle them
that's true a shotgun as long as as long
as you know who is behind the shot
so yeah no that won't happen we're not
getting pellet shot
right we would have to get pellet shot
to accommodate the fact that she can't
shoot the damn thing
well she has the base i'm sure so
there's no bayonets
it's all about the base how's that oh i
hate you
[Laughter]
all right and i'll get a little bit
extra ammunition as well yeah
he lays out everything that you want to
4 000 mirror right
it's a good deal dynamite expensive
rifle expensive shotguns expensive 38
not so good he just said shotguns were
expensive i don't
know three thousand three thousand
yeah the shotguns may get for about 50
us dollars
where oh you guys
i'm sure somewhere here in italy they
sell shotguns illegal
what a country this is the government
does not want guns in the hands of
individuals it's dangerous
i could do 4 000. you already said you
could do 4
do we want to pass on some of the
dynamite
you only got four i guess he's
losing money on us but yeah we don't
have that kind of money friend
so well
tell you what you help me out
i give you all this equipment free
what's your name
you asked for souls so help me
[Laughter]
what no i want you to deliver for me
deliver what and to whom this truck
that is my brother in palermo
you drive the truck to palermo drop off
the weapons
take the train back very easy i give you
all that free
hmm something else falls off the back of
the truck on the way down maybe it
doesn't
who's to say hmm right right what's the
distance what's the trip there how much
time
short
uh i think it's like a day
i think it's pretty much a day yeah
let's see
oh what what what sort of are are there
any inspections that we may have to go
through
oh i'm sure it's fine oh it's only uh
it's only like a four hour dr
oh no wrong place never mind the wrong
oh i'm just doing a
quick google search yeah it's a it's
like a 12-hour drive
yeah it's a long drive yeah and the 20s
will be a
bit longer i mean
[Music]
risk assessment role uh
geography i don't know let's go with
everybody make me an intelligence role
cool
success regularly look at a hard success
here
hard hard hey isn't palermo on an
island yeah oh son of a
not completely it's on cis it's in it's
it's on
sicily yeah you know there's probably a
ferry
probably it's a big ass truck come on
guys
hmm it's 5 000
you know time is money
all right four it's 4 000
what what what sort of checks and
inspections can we expect to
uh encounter on a ferry and on the road
there
are the military out and about is this a
commonly traversed area for the police
you give you give the guy fifty dollars
he looks the other way
i'm gonna glance at the others because
like not having to spend five thousand
four thousand dollars would be nice
yeah but it would be be able to get back
in time for the uh
the auction i'm not really addressing
that auction sorry john
yeah but if you want to stay for the
auction
i mean you've got to go to the trucker
but i'll put this way
i have the funds not the whole amount
mind you but i can pay
for this amount so if someone else wants
to chip in
we're done but if not i'll do i'll do a
truck ride
we'll have a little road trip here a
little adventure but
i love road trips and i mean joan the
person you were going to do the auction
for
so ah i was just hoping there would be
something else to help us
all right maybe but how often do you run
across
actual artifacts true artifacts like
that capstone
all right we got to get it back all
right i will say this for joan she does
have some resources there
something useful towards our assignment
and she can um
purchase that for us it's a long shot
mind you but
if john wants to stay in realm maybe a
few of us do the road trip
come back in two days well yeah how many
seats are in the truck to begin with
so at least one of you would be sitting
in and probably for comfort two of you
would be sitting in the back of the
truck
so i mean some of us should stay here if
some of us
i mean the thing is the two of you that
would
be the most successful at getting the
truck to its destination would be the
people who
i would be the most successful at
scoping out the uh
goings on of the less than legal
beetle controlled crime syndicates
in the area right i'm not really
interested in getting the attention of
these these mafiosos
i'm sure they'll see me watching them
i'm having a hard time
stealthily observing their operations uh
they're
yeah i'd much rather avoid that for the
time being
okay then joan and i'll stay here
we'll go to the marchetti house i can
always i don't know if anybody's gonna
notice that marco's gone for a day or
two
so find out
i'll find out i'll see if i hear
anything i'll look for marco and see if
i hear anything and then i will
represent him at the marchetti house
all right you would know that
normally
there's a ticket involved with
you know like so he would have had some
sort of invitation or ticket
and so i'm wondering if i go over to his
place if any of his
associates would you know you know
one way to find out yep all right so
alexander and donald are driving a truck
to
palermo and i think donald will do most
of the driving in alexandria
on the navigating and direction finding
in the the italian reading
yeah and periodically stopping on at
like little farmsteads to ask directions
all right both of you make me uh
drive automobile rolls
okay yeah not not a success
18 success all right one success was all
i needed so you
you will make it in the 12 hours
um that that it you know that so you
will make it
uh if you drive straight through um
you'll make it
the morning of the 17th
yeah let's probably do right i'll i'll
i'll take a turn driving so
so he can take a nap in the passenger
seat okay
so yeah you'll you'll get there about
10 a.m on the 17th um
and sure enough who you know the guy
who he his brother who he said would be
there
is there and he
thanks you for the truck and did you
take anything extra
i mean what well so what did you take
it'll be some ammunition and maybe two
more sticks of dynamite
okay and i i grabbed a hunting knife
like i may not be able to conceal it
easily but i want a little bit of extra
cutting power
yeah they won't notice the mama missing
a couple more sticks
rifles missing he clearly does not he
like he barely even does an
inventory he just opens it and sees a
bunch of cases
um notices that some of them are open
but doesn't really care and he's like
oh great thank you thank you tell uh
uh tell our friend that you have
done you've done a great service
to the to the the people's liberation
army
i'm like pause for a second look at
donald i'm just like
i keep running into people liberation
armies
yeah all right there dear and he
takes the truck and drives away
we'll take a ferry a nice night you take
a ferry and a train ride
back you will be back you will be
back the night
of you'll be back the next day the 18th
okay
from rome joan and dr hollister it is
10 o'clock at night on the 17th what are
you doing oh
eating and then sleeping does that sound
like a good order of harder to do it
in the other order
yeah sleep eating yeah not good um
well i i did want to see if if i
could get
to the
the place that i knew that marco
hung out that'd see if i could get
the tickets
all right you're trying to find
marco's apartment yes
to do the thing get the signs
i should get more because i have some in
my pocket right
oh zero zero two that
is a very damn cool yeah you you
a guy you know you you loosen a guy
up a little and he
tells you where marco's marco's
apartment was and
uh are you you're you're alone are you
gonna head off there
am i alone alone or is hollister with me
uh hollister
is not with you okay um
yes i'm gonna go all right all right so
by the time you get to his apartment
it's about 11. okay
uh you have you know this is not the
first time you've broken into a uh
a place like this and so uh
you know you unlike donal you don't
really pick locks you tend to like
you know break your you know you're
you're the breaking part of breaking and
entering
you this is
a there's like a
calendar that marco has been exiting
days off
in and uh
make me an italian role
i have none oh all right then yeah all
right sorry
no i have latin that's the closest i've
got uh
on the kitchen table there's like a
letter
written it's an italian obviously but
uh it's like four pages long do i see
the guy's name the marchetti house or
anything like that i see marchetti on it
not on this letter this letter is
in fact this letter is not to anyone
he's just writing on
on paper like he's written four pages
and it's like single space it's
double-sided
you know you you find sure you find
tickets
to to the to the marchetti
auction the next day um
let me take this letter though because
maybe alexandra can take a look at it
are you looking for anything else or are
you just like well um
since since i'm here
uh i think i will look in you know there
doesn't seem to be anybody else here
no does it look like he's the only one
who lives here yeah yeah it's not a
large this is
this is like a bedroom
kitchen kind of okay so what i'm
going to do
is i'm going to pick up like a
discharge or a handkerchief or something
like that because
don't want to leave everything
everywhere and i'm going to go through
his desk
and i'll go through his room and see if
there's anything else since i'm here and
since i know he's not coming back
okay make me a spot hidden roll and i'm
not going to trash it i'm just gonna i'm
gonna be looking yeah yeah yeah
well let's see what you roll uh
spot hidden i made it didn't oh just mr
hard
you could spend luck yeah okay
i don't want to go roll higher and have
to spend more i only have to spend two
to get a hard success
that that's a very slippery slope my
friend i'm i'm doing the slope because i
do that
all right good luck uh
and you get a hard success and so um
you'll find a little journal
that is written in in italian
okay i find a letter in journal in
italian but i don't find any other
you know either small relics jewels
anything like that
call it cthulhu man books are treasure
yeah oh no i know i know i'm just asking
because that's
that that is that is what he's got um
gotcha and i mean
by the view of this apartment he was in
a bad way
yeah he's not you know he was not doing
well yeah no i was afraid of that but
i thought i you know since i was here i
would take a peek
sure all right so i wipe down
anything i might have touched don't
leave anything
way out of place and i know it's broken
but i'll try to make it not look broken
all right yeah you you you make it
out and you make it back to the hotel
and it is now the morning of the 17th
so the 17th dawns hopefully
they're doing well and you know they
should reach
sicily sometime today we're doing great
fantastic don't worry about us i'm gonna
i
i know for me i suggest joan you do this
as well
uh to get a lovely breakfast it's the
most important meal of the day
is this this is the 18th right though
they'll be back the morning of the 18th
gotcha gotcha just sorry i thought i was
the wrong place okay
but pesticides at this time uh
i think ddt was already a thing yeah
probably
ooh and probably about 50 years from
being banned
the the thing is is for a lot of the the
incest
the the a lot of those poisons it's
about the
the volume right it's oh this is in
quantities that is large enough to kill
small insects but not enough to hurt
us i i want to look into
things that actually can can scale up
a little better
i'm wrong ddt was not in wide use until
the 40s
[Music]
but something like that we could because
people do have crops and things you're
looking for something
that would kill kill insects but not
crops
uh insects but not people
about insect people yeah i mean that's
it's a gamble that's that's the
that's the that's the the time
but i'm yes i'm i'm gonna i'm going to
spend my day
looking into constructing some sort of
trump card
let's see early insecticides used in the
1930s
your your search history must be so
weird
given my given my background i might be
aware of stuff that arsenic
was the most common insecticide used in
the thirties
oh crap then we're gonna go out of
arsenic
wow so get some arsenic some old lace
we'll
we'll figure out something i love that
play
me too so in 1934
farmers in the u.s used the following
insecticides 80-90 million pounds of
arsenic
73 million pounds of sulfur
oh yeah arsenic is your most
common insecticide well i figure i
can
i can work out some sort of cocktail
sulfur get sulfur in there
yeah like why why pass on any of those
right
make up make up just a wonderful bug
cocktail shake it up
shaken not stirred of course oh and then
you can offer
thomas would like to remind us to only
it's what they excel at yeah personally
i use alta vista
but you know i i always go for ass
jeeves man i'm old-fashioned
that things have gone insane a long time
so yeah let me know if i i need to make
any particular roles
to excuse me
water went down the wrong tube how
much like how much are you trying to buy
geez i mean i'm because if you just want
to get like enough for a garden
no problem but if you want to get enough
for like you know
we're going to be in an enclosed area
make me a chemistry role and what about
uh
gas masks too we might is there any like
smaller just lower face
no in the 20s it's all they don't have
that for gardening
like people when they're working they
have like filters and stuff no the
arsenic just tended to be
you know just just take a deep breath
people you know
it was it was always wearing a mask
oh wow i just
i just met it alright so you know
exactly how much you need
things that i forgot you know the the
weird like
uh stoichiometry stuff that i
all right yeah i'm gonna but so you can
yeah you can buy that and it's not
i figure it's mostly just getting a
delivery system
where i can get it as much in one place
yeah that will that will indeed be a
trick um
you know so the pesticide that you're
given
and they would sprinkle it all over
stuff the kerosene they'd spray
yeah if you mixed them and then sprayed
them i could just end up like
goop i will be somewhere else while
i'm just imagining a water balloon going
preferably somewhere across rome while
you're doing this
oh oh i'll work on this i'll uh
that's what so that's a dr hollister
did he roll anything else for this for
this delightful uh
no i i i i yeah i i spend my day looking
at the catalog
and trying to figure out if there's
anything okay
ooh 13. all right
there's all sorts of interesting cult
stuff
um but now make me a cthulhu mythos roll
there you go oh
he's making you make it you could say no
you could decline
you could choose not to but you're gonna
do it aren't you
yes good yes i mean i'm going to roll
but i'm not going to make it cause i
only got
like some we have inspiration
it did not make it what is your favorite
though
my my cthulhu mythos is six oh
you could push it yes
that is an outstanding idea okay i
rolled like a 69 so it was like
no nice inspiration
you want me to try to roll it again to
try to roll the six i want you to fumble
that's what i want before all right i'm
gonna try and roll again
all right let's see if you get an amy or
an emma here come on
oh i got more i got 85. all right
it's amy she's back on the board i'm on
all right i mean now it's more expensive
to spend luck but you could still do it
no all of your luck wouldn't it
i don't have enough well then you can't
all right um
so yeah there are some things that look
interesting occult wise
um there are some ceremonial daggers
that look kind of interesting
uh that would be good there are some
staves that look a little like staves
you recall
get them off the country alexandria
hears the word dagger and perks
and then they hear steve and go ugh
[Laughter]
but there there are no there's no jade
statues or anything like that
no jade statues there's there's a lovely
gold mask
oh no oh i like that
well i don't have that much in my pocket
so we'll have to see what i can get
uh so yeah that that is most of the most
of the 17th
um are you doing anything in the evening
of the 17th
a fire extinguisher just a big of
chemical spray just not sure
well no actually it's not a chemical
spray it's a it's a pump
yeah but you you pump it up it's
pressurized and then all the powder just
boom
yeah you can totally get a fire
extinguisher i'm gonna modify yeah
are are you gonna fill that with your
concoction oh yeah
uh you're probably not making a
there's an engineering role in this
system there's mechanical repair but i
don't see any engineering
cigarette a school from a skillful
engineering
is there engineering no no make me a
mechanical repair role
so no do we want to you want to spend
inspiration for that
i've got i've got a 10 in that sure you
know what why not we're getting close to
the end of the night might be well
do it you can do it that's much worse
but not a
not a critical fumble right as long as
you don't fumble you think you have an
okay fire extinguisher you know you
think you've
got done an okay job of so what were the
you mentioned
three poisons there's the i absolutely
have the arsenic right
yeah you have arsenic there was arsenic
kerosene
and sulfur sulfur sulfur there we go a
little bit of salt
you know it's fun mixing sulfur with
anything
let's try that out in small quantities
in a
in a small enclosed hotel room
speaking of someone who has worked in
housekeeping
don't play that game do not try this at
home friends
no he's sparkle would charcoal stabilize
that
[Music]
but you don't want to stabilize it
because then it won't work
we're not trying to blow it well i mean
we would love to blow this up but i'm
just trying to get
deadly chemicals onto this thing
i'm just trying to get deadly chemicals
on this thing
i think we can use that as an episode
title but i love it anyway i love it
anyway but okay
so i i know that nick is in there like
pounding his head on this stuff so i'm
gonna make sure he goes out to dinner
tonight
all right oh after he washes thoroughly
i'm asking you
questions and just yeah yeah
uh so make me a chemistry role
sir
all right yeah you think that you have
made a a very potent mix of poisons
god i am not going to be in that room
when you release that
calling it insecticide really undermines
the effect it would have on humans
yeah it's it's a it's a mostly incest
aside
into
they definitely yeah world war no yeah
world war ii there's
there's gas mask filters because they
learned from world war one
i think you mean the great war yeah
right the great war yes
so gas masks in the great war are not
great
i'm i'm not looking for i'm not looking
for great i'm looking for
emotional thing so are you going to look
for like
um a doctor's masks and things like
that
i want to do this step up from that but
yeah that's that's the starting off
point that's yeah
minimum yeah you can easily find
doctor's mask gas masks
yeah hard success yeah okay you find a
guy who will sell you a
uh again he'll sell you a couple gas
masks okay
one for you one for the lady here we go
well we're ready to go on our own you
wanna you wanna take this guy out
i'm sure all the humans will die from
this too
[Laughter]
oh that's tempting i'm joking
no you're not joking oh no tempting
it's very tempting now i'm googling
something that will get me
in trouble it's okay it's on me make
[Music]
all right i now know everything i need
to know oh no
if you can know like a five second thing
it's it's on the list of do not do
i demand an intelligence check with that
all right so it's it's the evening of
the 17th what are you two doing
you trying to go find where scaravelli
lives oh dinner first
oh yeah and then see dinner yes you
gotta have a good dinner
good dinner so we feel like okay yes do
you want to doctor
do you do you want to get this thing
what thing
now us alone beetle thing
let's eat food well we we did man we had
we had a great dinner
oh yeah well everyone wants to get
dessert
you want to wait for them to come back
yes
all right all right all right all right
but we have to tiramisu
yeah tomorrow we have to go to the um
oh go on what could go wrong i mean what
will alexandria and donald help you with
as far as the chemical side of things so
the auction is actually in the evening
yes 18. oh good when they get back we
can
go straight to garavetti and
uh set this off there'll be a
fire fight with tommy guns everything
will go great
oh i should have looked for some sort of
body armor you know what tomorrow
morning that'll be
nah where would you get that huh body
armor in the 20s is an interesting thing
yeah no heavy steel plates if anything
might just go by heavy steel plates and
attach them to the inside of a suit
i'm not joking okay first off a suit
would not be strong enough material to
hold that
like molly vests are barely strong
enough for the ceramic plates we have
these days
yeah okay get some leather straps
to hold it in place underneath a little
bit of fabric
so are you gonna try to pretend to be a
roman centurion is that what you're
going to do
oh let's just get some roman centurion
arm and wear that there we go
you need proper lamellar for something
like that although i don't
do not cross over into my medieval uh
interest i will trounce you on that one
no i think i'm gonna have to get thick
steel plates and
hope that no vital organs are hit
during the ensuing uh
fun i don't know man i i
i think we need to get that i think we
need to get
we could we we need to get our capstone
back
yeah that's why we're talking about you
no i wouldn't be able i'm can't there's
no way i'll be able to carry that
i got all this other stuff i got to
carry popstone you can carry some steel
plates
they'll be around your shoulders it'll
be fine i'm going to go yeah tomorrow
morning
the word bulletproof dates back to the
late 1500s
oh oh wow but in the 20s bulletproof
vests were essentially
really thick quilted vests
yeah then in world war ii they started
using flak jackets but you could not
move very well in them
right i'm not expecting to move very
well but i already don't move very well
so
all right so we eat dinner we we go to
bed and wait for the guys to come back
all right so it's the morning of the
the guys i'm from
jersey only one of us is a guy
who's guys i'm not a guy
um yes i know andre is very definitely
female thank you
this i know this i know
one of the beauties of y'all is that
it's non-gendered
[Music]
true
yeah no i it's funny i use that normally
in my speech
uh because i've learned it a poser if
you say all you do but
but guys and dude is more what i have
for this particular character
so yeah you all get back
and get together and you're a little
troubled that sitting in sort of the
common area of your room
is a a fire extinguisher
that has like tape over you know that
like is
as a do not touch written on it in tape
well i would not leave that in the
comment area but i would let them know
about it and i would show it off at the
first opportunity
oh hi everyone we're back
lovely lovely truck drive and train ride
and
got everything that we needed and not
spend four thousand dollars on it
it's so great to see you i think you're
away
so while you were gone i went to marco's
house
and i found he was writing this letter
in italian i couldn't read it and he has
this
journal and i found the tickets to get
into the
uh the the uh
okay the auction the auction tomorrow
it's like avila no auction to the villa
tomorrow so yeah that's tonight isn't
it
yeah it's tonight tonight all right
tonight all right
let let me have a look at the at the
i assume i assume you're not telling me
what's in it because it's an italian
that's right making an italian roll
i look at the doctor's fire extinguisher
i'm kind of curious what he's done here
all right
let me show it off okay so this letter
is from marco to
probably someone in his family but it's
not it's not labeled to anybody
and it's it's him
uh telling whoever this person is that
he's made a terrible mistake
he's fallen in with the wrong crowd he's
in real danger
they need to send him money or or
terrible things will happen to him okay
i'll i'll narrate that to joan
as i'm reading and translating line by
line
and it's raving like it goes on for four
pages saying the same
like different iterations of the same
thing like over and over
so i think to myself though i don't say
to joan that it reminds me of how she
was
when when when i had to snap her back
that's fair that's fair okay
so yeah four four pages to not four
pages to not say
very much at all but man he was in tough
times i'm
i i feel sorry for him and i'm kind of
i mean he's well out of it i almost envy
him
yeah poof instant poison
god damn it how large of an area are we
talking what's the area of effect here
well i tested it out with with with
just the chemicals in the original fire
extinguisher i had to empty it out
and i covered about this this amount of
space i got some
gas masks for the people who are going
to be closest i'm thinking we need some
time some armor for when the tommy guns
start going off
uh that's a bad idea i think we can't we
don't really move
um the mow is down well i'm already
pretty slow
so can you make any recommendations
a cover cover you want the fire that's
behind the cover around the corner
perhaps
well i won't have time if i'm or does
someone else want to use this
oh bloody hell out of the cloud of
poison will make it very difficult for
it to see
too donald and tiana you
are both donald and alexander uh
you are both like just looking at this
thing
like you have no idea how you would get
this into the room
with scaraveti because it is a
not small canister of chemicals
how big is it could we theoretically put
it into a duffel bag and haul it over
our shoulders
or is it too big even for that possibly
yeah
you could it would be a heavy duffle bag
what about a body bag
for instance a body bag would would fit
quite well
yes and we could make him think we have
okay i could be in it and i could be
wiggling
still life it opens it up i've got the
gas mask on and
poof that's crazy but it's it's so crazy
i love it i love it do not tempt me dr
hollister
oh you guys must be rubbing off on me
yes we really are
i'm actually considering this
i i want that to happen i'll do it
okay well at this point we just need to
find a body bag
that shouldn't be a problem yeah
somewhere emma is smiling about this
plan
i'm sure she is this is a very emma plan
there's no fire involved well there's a
fire extinguisher but that's the
opposite it's the anti-emma yeah
hollister make me a make me a chemistry
role
um hard success
yeah it's when you say there's no fire
involved
you remember that arsenic is highly
flammable
right one of the chemical rules was to
stabilize so it didn't
uh that's right yeah but it can still be
caught on fire but
uh yeah so you essentially have arsenic
dust and the dust is just like
flammable and guess what else is highly
flammable
and then there's the the charcoal yeah
no it's all it's all flammable
but it's not it's not gonna blow up on
me
it's x actually it works they will burn
themselves
i mean yeah it will match as we leave as
we're running out and that place will go
up
well if we can get it all over
scaravetti
any any flash could light it up
and if they're firing off tommy guns
there are a lot of flashes happening
i just really do not want to be in the
i value what's left of my life talon
sworn believes that emma has possessed
hollister
you've known amy too long nick she
transferred her consciousness over into
you
i'm too invested always there must
always be an emma
if there is not an emma there will be an
emma this is true
i'm just going to look at the three of
them and just like sigh and shake my
head and take the journal and very
pointedly walk over to a couch and sit
down and start reading it
sure all right i'll come over and see
what what do you got what do you got
what do you got i'm working on it hang
on and the journal will take
like you know she'll spend most of today
reading that journal
yeah i'll i'll read it and like make
notes in in a notepad as i'm as i'm
reading through it not like word for
word but getting the gist of what's
going on
and if there's something that i think is
really important i'll get it word for
word okay
and and i'll show those guys the catalog
too so we can see what kind of things
that
we might be able to get out of them are
we making cthulhu mythos rules now too
you can both make cthulhu mythos rolls
if you like i don't have the skill but i
can make it
do not have the skill with this
character sadly there you go
um it looks like a lovely auction full
of
great aid grade a material any any good
weapons in there
there are some knives knives alexandra
would like that let me get that for her
and and and for crosstalk alexander
perks
enough to come over and have a look uh
so who gosh
joan you know that it would probably be
a good idea to buy some nice clothes
uh these these are social events as much
as anything
right right especially when we're going
to this estate yeah and if you want to
you know
you know if you want to bid stuff you
got to you know
it'll it'll it'll make our our credit
rating look better
it's one of those you got to spend money
to make money things right
we have the money yep well i i know a
couple of places that we can go it's
it's
certainly not milan but i know a couple
of places yeah so you spend the day
getting tailored you get you know you
each get a couple of
lovely outfits tailored and i get a body
bag
and sure yeah they it's tech
the guy you keep calling a body bag and
the guy keeps going it's a suit bag
no i think we're talking about different
things
uh i mean the soup bag will is
essentially the size of a body bag
okay he just really gets us worried when
cause i i've had a doctor it's fine
perfect yeah thank you okay
uh all right yeah so yeah you are you're
now well dressed and it is the evening
of the 18th and you head
uh to the marchetti house and
um this is a swank party or
past hors d'oeuvres lovely beverages
um is anyone trying to bring in a gun
there are there is definitely security
i i almost never i almost never try to
bring guns anywhere that i am
uh daggers on the other hand i'll always
end up
bringing one in yeah so that's that's
standard procedure so yeah okay
somebody who's trying to sneak something
that's a 12 which would be the success
for donald yeah
uh what kind of success you get tiana
regular success
all right so strangely possibly due to
the
uh unfortunate vagaries of uh
women's clothing versus men's clothing
um they are
they they're they very politely
say we're sorry ma'am but we can't
allow your knife
in there in into the auction hall
so i'm alexandria generally tends to
wear
more masculine clothing they got a
really good role
not quite as good as tom's role on their
spot hidden
okay
sorry so like they're very you know they
very
very discreetly and very quietly
you know like they they essentially
slide a shoe box over
and alexandra will sigh quietly and put
one of one of the daggers
in it so you're gonna be left with one
dagger
that's fine okay which means like you
put seven
in the in the like you keep putting
one in and they're like
she is the epitome of that meme i said
all of the weapons
um but yeah sure you have one you have
one dagger that they
uh would never look in that place anyway
um
inner thigh no one looks so
uh you are in the auction hall there are
uh probably 30
rich ridiculous people here varner is
here
uh there are a bunch of other folks
uh that joan you know some of the people
um
there's a little bit of you know like oh
did you hear about marco oh that's
tragic yes so tragic
is there anyone here that i would
recognize from um
uh make me a luck roll okay do i want to
succeed or fail
yeah yeah
uh 46 out of 47 just made it
okay if you spot them then you can avoid
them
fair you spot a couple of people who
were patrons of the
of the of the opera nobody
particularly notable
but you know you think they probably
wouldn't recognize you you've lived a
lot of life
since then it's true longer hair
different voice but i mean
you never know and um
you know there's gonna be about an hour
for like
eating and mingling before the auction
starts
and about 30 minutes before the
auction starts
uh the the auctioneer says uh
ladies and gentlemen if you would
like to
peruse the exhibits we now have them
open
and they pull back a curtain and they're
in little glass
cases are all the items up for auction
let's check it out grab alexandria go
look at the knives
yeah no as soon as alexander spots the
dagger she's in b-line
yeah so the daggers look a lot more
ceremonial than
than useful um
but they look they look beautiful they
are they're you know bejeweled
and you know but but again they seem
more they don't seem they're not these
are not web
weapons these are ceremonial items no
and that that's that's where i'm like
yeah we could use these we could use
these we could use these
and i'm looking at them from both an
occult and a usable standpoint
although my occult my occult is way less
than my knife
uh yeah they seem ceremonial but you
know again
so just to be clear a cult is
you know i know how to make uh
i you know a cult is not
for lack of a better term magic like
those
is like a cult is like i heard a story
that you know you can put a a curse on
someone with
using a a rod of ash this way
cthulhu mythos is this is the mask of
ibn shroud
and you know with it you can see the
history of everyone that has died by the
hands
of the people that have worn this mask
you know that
i just made that item up but i like that
i'm going to use it i like that that's
good
you want to know what makes me really
sad my cathedrals is higher than my
occult
nice that's not nice
that's horrible that is amusing
um and so you know and the mask
is a it's a it's a very um
the mask that you guys saw in peru that
was gold
was thick and like blocky and was made
by
you know sort of pre made by pre-iron
age civilizations this one is a much
finer much thinner
um more filigreed mask
um does it look like we it has any of
the symbols that we would recognize as
being connected to narlathotep in
general
that's a cthulhu amita's role trying to
make some rules
i'll do it i can do anybody who wants
you can roll some cthulu mythos
yeah in the box um
wow i made a zero
five spot two wow
there you go the elder gods want us to
know this information
man i keep i've made it twice but it
doesn't go up when you make it so i know
you are fixated on those staves because
you get a feeling from those staves
that is weaker but similar to
the staves that you had before nice
alexandra one of the knives looks to you
like a description of one of the knives
of
um it was a knife that was made for uh
the pharaohs of egypt
and the blade was supposedly made out of
moonstone which the
is what the egyptians thought of as
meteorite
and i'm just looking at that with with
hungry eyes
yeah as you are looking at the staves
uh joan a man
walks by and looks at them and says oh
yes aren't those
lovely they are the epitome of
egyptology huh
i don't think so but i really like
huh you can make a psychology
role
i did all right you have made this
guy far more interested in the staves
yeah crap the the worst thing you can do
at an auction is go like no these are
these the what these these aren't worth
anything yeah but that's not
i can't yeah no everything
and and he just goes huh well
i'm sure like everything else here
they're valuable
oh really what do you think is valuable
oh i have my eyes on that mask
oh i think it would it would look
nice i almost wish i was over there
and so about five minutes before the
auction starts
a an attendant walks through with a
chime
and that's the signal to return back to
the auction hall
alexandria is very reluctant to leave
the moonstone blade but
will will peel herself away and
you um
you all go back in and uh
the you're all given paddles actually
you're given you have the invitation
jones so you're given the paddle
yes and uh
and the auction begins the first
there are some scrolls and things like
that
that didn't really seem to be of i mean
you know
they're probably significant and they
probably would sell for money but
um they uh
uh not a whole lot going on they are
being bit up
uh and uh
the auction is going on and everybody
out eight critical success
all right did anybody else get a harder
better you see
23. actually the process 22.
so you all got a hard success all right
so
uh alexandra first but all of you
um hear um
like you hear like very faint
kind of rumbling like moving
of moving of heavy objects
from somewhere in the it sounds like
it's in the building
like maybe it's not it it's not quite
like someone is moving furniture above
you but it sounds like somebody's moving
furniture
yeah i'm i'm sitting between joan and
donal and i'll like touch both of their
elbows and indicate what direction i
think i hear it from
with your with your thing you will
clearly hear it from
uh somewhere back where the
behind that curtained area that you were
uh doctor do you want to take a look
with me
i mean you're go yeah sure we can get
it's gonna be very hard to get up and
not be noticed
um everyone in this room is watching
everyone else to see
like a paddle come up or something like
that yeah no i was like i'm not warned
not be noticed i'm saying to not like
interfere or make a
scene so yeah you can go back to the
back of the room
and if you do an attendant will tell you
that you know the
the the buffet and the bathroom are
through this hall and she'll like point
down the hall
away from the curtain the forum the
foyer that you were in
is there a way to get over there or we
have to
obviously just go past i mean you'd
pretty much have to obviously go and
pull the curtain back to go in there
it's a thick burlap curtain a thick
velvet curtain this is a nice place
we'll be all right if i just wait here
for a moment i want to catch my breath
of course of course yeah so you guys are
standing in the back of the room
um i distract
the entire room i mean no no time to
release poison gas
no
i mean you can you can distract this
person i mean there's an attendant by
the
the curtain as well yeah
who does not seem to have heard anything
um
yeah i mean i'll i'll yeah i'll start
yeah you chat up the attendant
no problem so donald you could move
towards the curtain if you want but
there is another attendant there i
couldn't side to sidle over there kind
of just
kind of checking my arms on the back of
the room so
uh you know that that's that's that's
a relatively slow process another item
is auctioned off
um the the knife that you were not that
interested in is the next item up for
bid
and a couple people are bidding on it
very very fiercely
um donald you get up to the curtain
make me a make me a pow
roll 39
is a regular success all right
there's a faint like sulfurous order
odor you can smell
that's that's not good all right where's
the curtain
you are so there's an attendant standing
so the curtain
essentially has a pole that pulls it
back this is a ceiling to floor
curtain and there's an attendant just
standing by the pole
all right i think he will go right over
to where the pole just right
to the guy and kind of look behind the
curtain
okay there he'll just kill him like a
quick motion
okay yeah so the guy will be like i
beg your pardon sir but you definitely
get it aside
uh the room is dark back there um
with with it well not dark it's low
light um
and you see it looks like attendants
that are like getting things ready
to go you definitely smell that weird
sulfurous odor but it doesn't seem
like i mean you don't that that's pretty
much everything you see
do you smell that dece do you smell that
order what is that
um i i'm sorry sorry i can't i can't
say
you don't smell that no it it's
i smell something unfortunate yes and
but
um please that sir i need to ask you
to to return to your seat
and he starts trying to pull the curtain
closed sounds like something foul back
there
something something's broken or
something well
the attendants back there will take care
of it they are they're very well trained
all right so i thought i'll step away
from the curtain just a bit but stay in
the back of the room okay yeah you're
back there by that attendant sure
um i'm keeping half an eye on donald to
see what's going on sure
sure oh kind of a worried look but he
doesn't know you just
okay so the items when they come from
the back
are out of the case they're brought up
on trays
and the auctioneer will pick up the item
and he'll like show it to the crowd and
he'll describe it
uh and so the next item
that comes up is the knife that you were
interested in
um alexandra and an attendant brings
it up on a tray
and hands it and the auctioneer grabs it
and there's a pause
and the auctioneer says this is a um
this was believed to be a meteor a knife
made out of meteorite presented to the
pharaoh
uh two ton common uh
it was it is
one of a kind and
it thirsts for the blood
of infidels and as he says that like as
he's looking straight at
the knife just in one easy gesture
goes across the throat of the attendant
there
and the blood that comes out of the
throat
just seeps into the knife and the knife
like
and the auctioneer just keeps going like
nothing has happened
how does the rest of the room react to
that not well there is
there are screams there are gasps people
are like
what you know there's some people who
are like this
this is most peculiar but
you know the crowd here you hear a
sterile scream over here
the crowd made it sanity rolls so you
all right success 16. you're also all
surprised
all right joan you are going to lose for
a living this is
not weird you are you're gonna lose two
sanity
um and you're the only person that
seems to seems to really care that
somebody was just killed
and like the guy is not doing it unlike
this this the the the the assistant
drops to the ground and there's no blood
and he continues to hold the the
blade and he holds the blade aloft and
he says
um and with
the blood on this blade the pharaohs
return and uh
and the a wave of red energy
shoots out of the dagger
throughout the room and everybody make
me a pal roll
kind of oh my gosh the crowd rolls at
i got a critical success so you all
feel this wave wash across you of some
and then you notice that everyone else
in the crowd
is now standing and their eyes
all right read for the pistol yeah i'm
i'm i'm gonna stand up and draw the one
dagger that i still have access to and
just be like
what's our play that everyone seems to
be ignoring you
and the auctioneer is just like droning
on about
you know the the pharaohs will rise
again and
yeah i'll i'll i'll go over to where
donald is and join him
where are where are the staves right now
the names are behind that curtain
come on mcdonald's at the one that
donald's at okay then i'll go there
i'm gonna okay so grab a chair and then
join them
all right yeah you are standing with the
three of them joan is by herself
um you can easily slip behind the
curtain because the attendant's eyes are
blood red and staring off into nothing
bastion let's go back let's go i i need
to get that i need to get the staves
so stone slides behind the curtain joan
is now separated from everybody else
alexandra do you want that that docker
i really do well i think one for
something
sorry both both of you talked at once
and i couldn't understand either of you
but are you sure you want that dagger
the cursed
dagger do i do i still feel a pull
toward it with uh
what i rolled on cathedral and cthulhu
oh yes yeah
darling you don't you don't want that
dagger we should stop that though
so as you're as you're three in the back
alexander sorry joan you've gone
behind the curtain we'll deal with you
in a minute
uh another attendant has just been
killed
i need to get that away from him yeah
the dagger is once again red
at the very least i need to get that
thing away from him
and now the people in the audience are
starting to very docilely
walk towards the stage like a line
i'm gone can't stop me if you wanted to
i'm gone
all right so you we'll get to you we'll
you will be in initiatives there
you go behind uh
54 i just make it okay you smell like a
okay the room is the room is dark
but you know exactly where the staves
are
so you start to head towards them yep uh
make me a listen roll
nope okay everything's fine yep i don't
hear anything
um you get to
uh the case where the stave should be
and that's when you notice that all the
somebody's already been back here all
right i gotta go back out to the other
guys
all right when you turn around there is
someone in front of you
wearing the gold mask and holding the
stave
and that's where we're going to end
we'll probably be in initiatives when we
start the next one right
like because alexandria is moving
towards the guy with the moon blood
there are too many people who are about
to die
yeah no and i'm going to be cussing in
uh all right so so that's that's
gonna do it for quest and cthulhu
again thank you so much for spending
part of your geek end with us
uh we we again have a full
lineup monday james is back running with
three of the people that are
here on this stage for dragons of ice
fire mountain
chasm dragon of ice spire peak dragon of
ice fire peak sure
level characters good times yeah first
level characters
getting i really hope we level soon
we hit with dragon breath we pushed a
dragon from the field of battle so
yeah that's right well you get
experience
uh tuesday it's the chaos agents who i
don't even know what level they
are anymore 10 we just leveled level
um after level 10 it starts to get silly
i i i can call on my goddess and have a
1 in 10 chance of her showing up and
changing the battlefield i'm pleased
you know you could do that in cthulhu
too yes
but the the elder gods are not inclined
to actually help
oh wait it's absolutely nice wait emma
has the summon nodon spell right emma
can summon
god that was that was old old emma that
did that
current democrat i think current emma
has that ability as well
i think she learned it oh no was that
you no yeah no it's emma she learned it
in
uh regardless tuesday chaos agents
saturday
we are back here once again uh
you know it's like emma wasn't even gone
really right
yeah it's there were explosives
there was poison which which honestly is
an escalation that
i've been expecting and then there were
arcane rituals
it's like emma never left so our quotes
for this one
um we don't want to go to france there's
always a reason for a backup hotel
i'm not usually one to point to violence
i'm not thrilled with giving this thing
souls
is anyone good with grenades and then
there's a soul-eating beetle in front of
you
i'm just trying to get deadly chemicals
on this thing
[Laughter]
fumble full it's like old faithful uh
yeah that was uh
that was quite a saturdays so thanks
everybody we had no rolling blackouts
that's always exciting and
so i will sounds like somebody said
the audio just went i hope
they might not be able to hear us
anymore i'm not sure uh
thomas did you turn us off already yeah
he's like that's enough
enough he's done so i think that is
the sign
friends
you
